The question is asking which option is more likely to occur.\n2. Option (a) states that Kevin would complain to Laura about the pace of her washing. This seems like a plausible scenario, as people often complain about the pace of work or other tasks.\n3. Option (b) states that Kevin would complain to Laura about the pace of her washing because he was eager to win the bet. This seems less plausible, as it implies that Kevin's motivation for complaining is purely driven by his desire to win the bet, rather than any genuine concern about the pace of Laura's washing.\n\nOverall, option (a) seems more likely to occur than option (b).",
