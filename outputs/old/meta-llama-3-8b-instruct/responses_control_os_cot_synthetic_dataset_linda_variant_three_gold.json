We know that the woman had a heart attack, which increases the likelihood of breathlessness. However, breathlessness is not a direct consequence of a heart attack. Therefore, the probability of breathlessness given a heart attack, P(B|H), is less than 1.\n\nNow, let's consider the event \"sweating\" (S). Sweating is not directly related to a heart attack. Therefore, the probability of sweating given a heart attack, P(S|H), is also less than 1.\n\nNow, let's consider the conjunction event \"breathlessness and sweating\" (B and S). The probability of this conjunction event, P(B and S), is the product of the probabilities of its constituent events: P(B) and P(S). Since both P(B) and P(S) are less than 1, the product P(B) \u00d7 P(S) is also less than 1.\n\nTherefore, the probability of the conjunction event \"breathlessness and sweating\" given a heart attack, P(B and S|H), is also less than 1.\n\nNow, let's compare the probabilities of the two events:\n\n(a) She also experiences breathlessness.\n(b) She also experiences breathlessness and sweating.\n\nSince P(B|H) is less than 1, and P(S|H) is also less than 1, the probability of the conjunction event \"breathlessness and sweating\" given a heart attack, P(B and S|H), is less than the probability of the event \"breathlessness\" given a heart attack, P(B|H).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) She also experiences breathlessness.",
