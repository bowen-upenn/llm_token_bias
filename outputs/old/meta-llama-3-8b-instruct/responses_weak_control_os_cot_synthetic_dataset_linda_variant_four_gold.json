However, this statement adds an additional element: the audience's reaction to the show.\n\nNow, let's think about the probabilities of these two statements. The first statement, \"He will not showcase any new material,\" seems like a relatively likely statement. After all, Jerry Seinfeld is a seasoned comedian who has been touring for decades. He likely has a well-established set of jokes and material that he has honed over the years.\n\nOn the other hand, the second statement, \"He will not showcase any new material but will receive standing ovations at every show,\" seems like a relatively unlikely statement. After all, if Jerry Seinfeld is not showcasing any new material, it's unlikely that his audience will be particularly impressed or enthusiastic about his performance.\n\nSo, based on these considerations, I would say that the first statement, \"He will not showcase any new material,\" is more likely to be true than the second statement, \"He will not showcase any new material but will receive standing ovations at every show.\"",
