Aarav Karamchand Gandhi is likely to speak in favor of modern industrial policies, but he would also emphasize traditional values and non-violent resistance, which are core principles of Mahatma Gandhi's philosophy.",

Not only does the podcast receive mediocre reviews, but it also gains millions of subscribers. This is where the conjunction fallacy comes in.\n\nThe conjunction fallacy is the tendency to think that a more specific event is more likely to occur than a less specific event. In this case, the specific event is the podcast receiving mediocre reviews but gaining millions of subscribers. The less specific event is simply the podcast receiving mediocre reviews.\n\nThe conjunction fallacy suggests that people are more likely to believe that the podcast will receive mediocre reviews but gain millions of subscribers than that it will simply receive mediocre reviews. This is because the specific event is more vivid and attention-grabbing than the less specific event.\n\nOverall, the conjunction fallacy suggests that people are more likely to believe in the specific event (the podcast receiving mediocre reviews but gaining millions of subscribers) than in the less specific event (the podcast receiving mediocre reviews).",

On one hand, it's possible for a movie to win no awards but still be a box office hit. After all, there are many examples of movies that have achieved commercial success without winning any major awards.\n\nOn the other hand, it's also possible for a movie to win no awards but still be a box office failure.
