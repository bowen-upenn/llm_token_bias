The second event is Miley Cyrus attending the final ceremony of the Masters golf tournament.\n4. The question is asking which of these two events is more likely to happen.\n\nBased on this analysis, I would say that the Masters golf tournament ending Sunday is more likely to happen. This is because the Masters golf tournament is a well-established event that takes place every year in April. The event is widely covered by media and is a major attraction for golf enthusiasts.\n\nOn the other hand, Miley Cyrus attending the final ceremony of the Masters golf tournament is less likely to happen. While Miley Cyrus is a well-known celebrity, there is no established connection between her and the Masters golf tournament. Therefore, it is less likely that she would attend the final ceremony of the tournament.",
