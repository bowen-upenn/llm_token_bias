Jack began to bring his lunch to school.\n\nOne day, there was pizza in the cafeteria. Jack wished he hadn't brought his lunch.\n\nNow, we have to decide which option is more likely.\n\nOption (a) states that Jack might try the pizza in the cafeteria. This is a possible scenario, as Jack might be curious about the pizza and want to try it.\n\nOption (b) states that Jack might try the pizza in the cafeteria because he had heard from his friends that it was much better than usual. This is also a possible scenario, as Jack might be influenced by his friends' opinions and want to try the pizza himself.\n\nBased on these possible scenarios, I would say that option (a) is more likely, as it is a more straightforward and plausible scenario.",
