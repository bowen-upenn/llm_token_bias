However, even with a loyal fan base, an album can still receive poor reviews and low sales if it's not up to par.\n\n(b) The album receives poor reviews but one single becomes a top hit on the charts.\n\nThis option seems less likely, but still possible. Even if the album as a whole receives poor reviews, it's possible that one single stands out and becomes a top hit. This could be due to a variety of factors, such as the single's catchy melody, its lyrics, or the way it's marketed.\n\nBased on these options, I would say that option (a) is more likely.",
