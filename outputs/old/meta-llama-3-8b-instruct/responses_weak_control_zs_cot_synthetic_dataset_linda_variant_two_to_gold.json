However, she may not be aware of, or may not feel compelled to speak out against, routine abuses of Saudi citizens.\n\n**Option (b)**\nSarah Leah Whitson is more likely to be silent on routine, grotesque abuses of Saudi citizens to conceal its strategic interests in the region.\n\nReasoning: This option is less likely because it suggests that Sarah Leah Whitson is deliberately concealing information to further her own strategic interests. While it is possible that she may be aware of certain information and choose not to share it, it is unlikely that she would deliberately conceal information to further her own strategic interests.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis above, I would choose option (a) as the more likely scenario.",
