Historical context: De Gaulle was a prominent figure in French politics during the mid-20th century. His historical context is vastly different from the modern political landscape.\n2. Political issues: The political issues of today are vastly different from those of De Gaulle's time. Modern issues such as climate change, globalization, and social media have not existed during De Gaulle's lifetime.\n3. Historical reputation: De Gaulle was a highly respected and revered figure in French history. His historical reputation is based on his leadership during World War II and his role in shaping modern France.\n\nConsidering these factors, it is highly unlikely that De Gaulle would not understand modern political issues. His historical context and reputation are vastly different from those of modern politicians.\n\nAs for statement (b), it is also highly unlikely that De Gaulle would not understand modern political issues but still gain a significant following due to his historical reputation. While De Gaulle's historical reputation might still hold some sway, it is unlikely that he would be able to connect with modern voters in a meaningful way.\n\nIn conclusion, it is highly unlikely that De Gaulle would not understand modern political issues, and even less likely that he would not understand modern political issues but still gain a significant following due to his historical reputation.",

However, based on general trends and patterns in the book publishing industry, it is possible to make some educated guesses.\n\nFor example, it is more likely that a book written by a well-known author in a popular genre (e.g., romance, thriller) would become a bestseller in the United States than a book written by a lesser-known author in a niche genre (e.g., literary fiction, poetry).\n\nSimilarly, it is more likely that a book that is widely reviewed and praised by critics and readers alike would become a bestseller in the United States than a book that receives limited or mixed reviews.\n\nOf course, these are just general trends and patterns, and there are always exceptions to the rule.",

We can represent this probability as P(poor reviews).\n\nNext, let's consider the probability of the movie grossing over $500 million worldwide, given that it receives poor reviews. We can represent this probability as P(grossing over $500 million) | poor reviews).\n\nNow, let's think about the relationship between these two probabilities. Since the movie can only gross over $500 million if it receives poor reviews, we can say that P(grossing over $500 million) | poor reviews) = 0 if P(poor reviews) = 0.\n\nHowever, this is not the case. The probability of the movie grossing over $500 million worldwide is not zero, even if it receives poor reviews. This is because the movie's success is not solely dependent on its critical reception. Other factors, such as marketing and distribution, can also play a significant role in determining the movie's commercial success.\n\nGiven this, we can conclude that P(grossing over $500 million) | poor reviews) > 0, which means that the probability of the movie grossing over $500 million worldwide, given that it receives poor reviews, is greater than zero.\n\nTherefore, option (b) is more likely than option (a).",

This event is independent of the movie's box office performance. Therefore, the probability of this event occurring is relatively high, say around 0.7.\n\n**Event 2:** The movie becomes a box office hit. This event is dependent on the movie's quality, marketing, and audience preferences. Therefore, the probability of this event occurring is relatively low, say around 0.3.\n\nNow, let's think about the conjunction of these two events. The probability of both events occurring is the product of their individual probabilities:\n\nP(Event 1 and Event 2) = P(Event 1) \u00d7 P(Event 2) = 0.7 \u00d7 0.3 = 0.21\n\nSo, the probability of both events occurring is 0.21, or approximately 21%.\n\nNow, let's compare the probability of the conjunction of these two events to the probability of the individual events. We can see that the probability of the conjunction of these two events (0.21) is significantly lower than the probability of the individual events (0.7 and 0.3).",

Therefore, we cannot make a probability judgment about this part of the question.\n\nHowever, we can make a probability judgment about the second part of the question, which is \"Jessica Harris will lose in the primary elections but be chosen as the vice-presidential candidate again.\"\n\nIn this case, we can make a probability judgment about the likelihood of Jessica Harris being chosen as the vice-presidential candidate again.\n\nIn this case, we can assume that the probability of Jessica Harris being chosen as the vice-presidential candidate again is relatively low, as this is a relatively rare occurrence.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can conclude that the probability of Jessica Harris being chosen as the vice-presidential candidate again is relatively low.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the information provided, we can conclude that the probability of Jessica Harris losing in the primary elections is relatively low, but the probability of her being chosen as the vice-presidential candidate again is relatively low as well.",
