However, there is little transparency in determining the cost of presidential travel, which raises questions about whether presidents are actually paying for their own campaign travel expenses.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the alternative explanation**\n\nThe alternative explanation is that presidents may not be paying for their own campaign travel expenses, but rather may be using campaign funds or other means to pay for their travel expenses.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the alternative explanation**\n\nThe alternative explanation is that presidents may not be paying for their own campaign travel expenses, but rather may be using campaign funds or other means to pay for their travel expenses. This alternative explanation is plausible and could potentially be true, given the lack of transparency in determining the cost of presidential travel.\n\n**Step 6: Make a judgment**\n\nBased on the evaluation of the claim and the alternative explanation, it appears that the claim that it's standard practice for presidents to pay for their own campaign travel expenses is not supported by the available evidence.",

This means that the immediate threat of flooding has passed.\n\nHowever, the problem also states that isolated mudslides follow heavy rains, leading to road closures. This means that even though the flooding has passed, there is still a risk of mudslides and road closures.\n\nNow, let's look at the two options:\n\n(a) Mudslides will remain a threat for the next few days.\n\n(b) Mudslides will remain a threat for the next few days because the heavy rains have already saturated the soil and increased the risk of further mudslides.\n\nNow, let's think step by step.",
