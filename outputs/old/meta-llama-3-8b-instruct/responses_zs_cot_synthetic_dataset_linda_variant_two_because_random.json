Israeli officials say that Qatar wants to provide economic aid to Gaza.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the likelihood of each option.\n\n(a) Israel fears any aid would bolster Hamas, officials say.\n\nThis option is more likely. Israeli officials have a history of being wary of any aid to Gaza, as they believe it could be used to support Hamas. Given this history, it is likely that Israeli officials would express concerns about any aid to Gaza.\n\n(b) Israel fears any aid would bolster Hamas, officials say because Qatar has a new emir who is eager to improve relations in the region.\n\nThis option is less likely. While it is true that Qatar has a new emir who may be eager to improve relations in the region, this does not necessarily mean that Israeli officials would be more likely to accept aid from Qatar. Israeli officials have consistently expressed concerns about any aid to Gaza, and it is unlikely that they would suddenly change their stance simply because Qatar has a new emir.",
