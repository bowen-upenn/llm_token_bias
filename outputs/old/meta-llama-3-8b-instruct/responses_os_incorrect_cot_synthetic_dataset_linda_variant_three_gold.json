Now, we need to decide which of the two options is more likely.\n\nLet's start by thinking about John's age and the fact that he had a heart attack. These two factors suggest that John is at a higher risk of experiencing other health problems related to his age and heart condition.\n\nNow, let's think about the two options. Option (a) suggests that John's heart attack was accompanied by vomiting and chest pain. While it's possible that John could have experienced these symptoms, it's not necessarily the most likely scenario.\n\nOn the other hand, option (b) suggests that John's heart attack was accompanied by vomiting. This option seems more plausible, given the fact that John is 64 years old and has a history of heart disease.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, I would say that option (b) is more likely to occur.",

It is characterized by degenerative changes in the spine, which can lead to symptoms such as neck pain, stiffness, and limited range of motion.\n\nGiven this information, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(a) He experiences neck pain and weakness in limbs.\n\nThis option is more likely because Cervical spondylosis can cause symptoms such as neck pain, stiffness, and limited range of motion. Weakness in limbs is also a possible symptom of Cervical spondylosis.\n\n(b) He experiences neck pain.\n\nThis option is less likely because while neck pain is a possible symptom of Cervical spondylosis, it is not the only symptom. Weakness in limbs is also a possible symptom of Cervical spondylosis.",
