Many books receive mixed or negative reviews, so it's not hard to imagine a scenario where the first book in a series receives harsh critical reviews.\n\nOption (b) is a bit more unusual, but not impossible. It's not uncommon for books to receive mixed reviews, with some critics praising the book while others criticize it. So, it's not hard to imagine a scenario where the first book in a series receives harsh critical reviews but still becomes a bestseller.\n\nBased on these considerations, I would say that Option (a) is more likely to occur. While it's not impossible for a book to receive harsh critical reviews and still become a bestseller, it's certainly a less common occurrence than receiving harsh critical reviews alone.",
