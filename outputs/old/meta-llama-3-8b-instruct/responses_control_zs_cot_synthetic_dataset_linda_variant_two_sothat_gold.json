This event is unlikely to occur, as the moderator is unlikely to admit to dropping the ball. Probability: low (less than 10%).\n* Event B: The moderator admitted dropping the ball when Clinton talked about Monica Lewinsky so that he could steer the conversation back to campaign issues. This event is also unlikely to occur, as the moderator is unlikely to admit to dropping the ball for a specific reason. Probability: low (less than 10%).\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the probability of the conjunction**\n\nWe can evaluate the probability of the conjunction of Events A and B as follows:\n\nP(A and B) = P(A) \u00d7 P(B)\n\nSince both Events A and B are unlikely to occur (probability less than 10%), the probability of the conjunction is also low:\n\nP(A and B) = P(A) \u00d7 P(B) < 0.1 \u00d7 0.1 = 0.01\n\nTherefore, the probability of the conjunction of Events A and B is very low, less than 1%.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn conclusion, the probability of the conjunction of Events A and B is very low, less than 1%. This is because both Events A and B are unlikely to occur, with probabilities less than 10%.",
