This suggests that the practice is widespread and non-partisan.\n2. There is little transparency in determining the cost of presidential travel. This implies that the costs are not publicly disclosed or easily accessible.\n3. The statement mentions that taxpayers also pay for travel to campaign events that rally support rather than raise money. This suggests that the costs of presidential travel are not limited to official government business, but also include travel related to campaign events.\n\nBased on these points, it is more likely that the costs of presidential travel are not fully transparent and that taxpayers may be paying for travel related to campaign events.",
