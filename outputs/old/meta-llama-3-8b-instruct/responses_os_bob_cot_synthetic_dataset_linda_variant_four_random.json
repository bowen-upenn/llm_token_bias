However, the world has changed significantly since then. The rise of new global powers, the increasing importance of international organizations, and the growing complexity of global issues may all contribute to James Catlett Marshall's struggle to understand contemporary geopolitics.\n\nOption (b) He struggles to understand contemporary geopolitics but eventually brokers a groundbreaking international agreement.\n\nReasoning: While James Catlett Marshall may struggle to understand contemporary geopolitics, his experience and reputation as a skilled diplomat may ultimately help him to navigate the complexities of modern international relations and broker a groundbreaking international agreement.\n\nBased on this analysis, I would argue that option (b) He struggles to understand contemporary geopolitics but eventually brokers a groundbreaking international agreement. is more likely than option (a) He struggles to understand contemporary geopolitics.",
