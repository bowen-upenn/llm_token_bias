This suggests that Alvarez has been out of action for some time and is looking to get back into the ring.\n\nGiven this context, let's consider the two options presented:\n\n(a) Alvarez loses the fight.\n(b) Alvarez loses the fight but wins the rematch.\n\nBased on the information provided, I would say that option (a) is more likely. This is because Alvarez is coming off a period of inactivity, and it's generally more difficult to regain form and momentum after a prolonged break.\n\nOf course, this is just my analysis based on the information provided. Ultimately, the outcome of Alvarez's comeback fight will depend on a variety of factors, including Alvarez's training and preparation, his opponent's strengths and weaknesses, and the overall conditions of the fight.",

Instead, he might emphasize the importance of traditional values, self-sufficiency, and non-violent resistance.\n\nTherefore, I would select option (b): He speaks in favor of modern industrial policies but emphasizes traditional values and non-violent resistance.",
