This is a relatively common occupation, and Linda's background in philosophy might suggest that she is more likely to be involved in intellectual or creative pursuits rather than a more routine occupation like being a bank teller.\n* Option (b) Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement. This option is less likely because it involves two relatively uncommon characteristics: being a bank teller and being active in the feminist movement.\n\nProblem 2:\n\n* Option (a) Alex experiences loss of balance and frequent nosebleeds. This option is less likely because it involves a number of health issues, including loss of balance, frequent nosebleeds, and Hypertension.\n* Option (b) Alex experiences loss of balance. This option is more likely because it involves only one health issue, loss of balance, which is a common symptom of Hypertension.\n\nIn summary, the most likely option in each problem is:\n\nProblem 1: Option (a) Linda is a bank teller.\n\nProblem 2: Option (b) Alex experiences loss of balance.",
