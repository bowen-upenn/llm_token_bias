        "question": "Raj is a 28-year-old guy with a passion for computer science and mathematics. He graduated with a double major in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. Raj is known for his analytical mind, attention to detail, and love for problem-solving. In his free time, he enjoys coding personal projects, playing video games, and exploring different programming languages. Raj also has a strong interest in astronomy and often spends his evenings stargazing with his telescope. With his friendly and approachable demeanor, Raj is always willing to help his friends and classmates with challenging coding tasks.\n\nWhich is more probable?\n(a) Raj is a passenger vehicle driver.\n(b) Raj is a passenger vehicle driver and enjoys participating in hackathons and coding competitions.",

        "use_multi_agents": false,
        "init_model_answer": "Based on the description provided, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Raj is a passenger vehicle driver.\n\nThe reason for this choice is the conjunction fallacy, which occurs when people believe that a combination of specific conditions is more probable than a single general condition alone. In this case, option (b) combines two specific conditions (being a passenger vehicle driver and enjoying hackathons and coding competitions), which might seem more representative of Raj's interests and personality. However, the probability of two events occurring together is always less than or equal to the probability of either event occurring alone.\n\nGiven the information provided, we have no evidence to suggest that Raj is a passenger vehicle driver. His interests and educational background are more aligned with computer science and programming. Therefore, adding the condition of being a passenger vehicle driver to his enjoyment of hackathons and coding competitions does not increase the probability of the statement being true.",

        "init_model_answer": "The correct answer is (a) Dwayne is a tile and stone setter.\n\nThe conjunction fallacy is at play here. Option (b) is more specific than option (a), as it includes all the information in (a) plus additional details. While those extra details may seem to fit Dwayne's description, a more specific scenario is inherently less probable than a more general one which it entirely contains.\n\nDwayne's degrees and culinary interests don't make him more likely to be a tile setter. Without additional relevant information, the probability he has that occupation is independent of those other traits. Option (b) can't be more probable than (a), since for (b) to occur, (a) must also occur.\n\nThis type of conjunction fallacy is a common cognitive bias in human reasoning about probabilities. Rationally, a compound scenario can never be more probable than a simpler scenario it completely encompasses. The mind has a tendency to find detailed descriptions more plausible, but more specific possibilities are mathematically less probable.",

While Sione's background suggests they may indeed enjoy beach clean-ups, adding that detail makes the scenario more specific and thus less probable overall compared to just stating their occupation.",

But probability theory dictates that the probability of two events both occurring (the \"conjunction\") will always be less than or equal to the probability of either one occurring alone.\n\nSo while the details in (b) are consistent with Sandeep's bio, adding those extra details makes that option less probable than (a), not more probable.

There are many gambling dealers, but only a subset of them also volunteer at LGBTQ+ centers.\n\nIt's a common reasoning error to think more specific scenarios are more probable than general ones.
