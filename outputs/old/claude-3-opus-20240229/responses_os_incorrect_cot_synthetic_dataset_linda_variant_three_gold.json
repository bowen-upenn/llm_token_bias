Loss of balance, while it can be a symptom of hypertension, is less common than headaches. It usually occurs when hypertension is severe or has been untreated for a long time, leading to complications such as inner ear problems or stroke.\n\n4. Given that the question doesn't provide any information about the severity or duration of the man's hypertension, we can assume it's a relatively new diagnosis without severe complications at this stage.\n\n5.

Brain hemorrhage: A brain hemorrhage is a type of stroke caused by an artery in the brain bursting and causing localized bleeding. This bleeding can cause a buildup of pressure in the skull, leading to various symptoms.\n\n2. Paralysis: The patient, Alex, has experienced paralysis, which is a common symptom of a brain hemorrhage. The location and severity of the hemorrhage determine the extent and location of the paralysis.\n\n3. Altered sensorium: An altered sensorium refers to a change in a person's level of consciousness or awareness. This can include confusion, disorientation, or difficulty in responding to stimuli. Altered sensorium is a common symptom of a brain hemorrhage due to the increased pressure on the brain.\n\n4. Headache: A sudden, severe headache is another common symptom of a brain hemorrhage. The headache is caused by the increased pressure within the skull and the irritation of the meninges (the membranes that cover the brain).\n\nConsidering these factors, option (a) is more likely. A brain hemorrhage often presents with a combination of symptoms, including paralysis, altered sensorium, and headache. While altered sensorium alone can occur, the presence of a headache in addition to the altered sensorium and paralysis makes option (a) more probable.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is (a) They also experience altered sensorium and headache.",

Option (b) states that Alex experiences vomiting in addition to paralysis, without mentioning one-sided weakness.\n\n3) Vomiting is a common symptom of increased pressure in the brain, which can be caused by a hemorrhage.

Depression is a common comorbidity with migraine. Studies have shown that people with migraine are about 2-4 times more likely to suffer from depression compared to the general population. This association is thought to be due to shared underlying neurobiological mechanisms.\n\n3. Acidity, or acid reflux, is a digestive issue where stomach acid flows back into the esophagus, causing discomfort.

Common symptoms of hypoglycemia include shakiness, dizziness, sweating, confusion, and anxiety.\n\n2. Palpitations, which are feelings of a rapid, fluttering, or pounding heartbeat, can also occur with hypoglycemia. This is because low blood sugar levels can trigger the release of hormones like epinephrine (adrenaline), which can cause the heart to beat faster.\n\n3. Anxiety is a common psychological symptom that can accompany hypoglycemia. When blood sugar levels drop, it can cause feelings of nervousness, irritability, and anxiety.\n\n4. The person's age, gender identity, and ethnicity do not significantly influence the likelihood of experiencing palpitations or anxiety with hypoglycemia, as these symptoms can occur in individuals of all demographics.\n\n5. Given that both palpitations and anxiety are common symptoms of hypoglycemia, and anxiety is an additional symptom on top of palpitations, the probability of the person experiencing both palpitations and anxiety is lower than the probability of them experiencing only palpitations.\n\nTherefore, the more likely answer is (b) They also experience palpitations.",

Brain hemorrhage can lead to a variety of symptoms depending on the location and severity of the bleed. Paralysis is one common symptom.\n\n2. Vomiting is another common symptom of brain hemorrhage, as the increased intracranial pressure and irritation can stimulate the vomiting center in the brain.\n\n3. Altered sensorium, which refers to a change in a person's level of consciousness or awareness, is also a frequent manifestation of brain hemorrhage. This can range from mild confusion to coma.\n\n4. The combination of paralysis, vomiting, and altered sensorium is a classic presentation of a significant brain hemorrhage.\n\n5. While vomiting alone can occur with brain hemorrhage, the additional presence of altered sensorium suggests a more severe case.\n\nGiven these considerations, option (a) \"Alex also experiences vomiting and altered sensorium\" is more likely than option (b) \"Alex also experiences vomiting\" alone in the context of a brain hemorrhage causing paralysis.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is (a) Alex also experiences vomiting and altered sensorium.",

Weakness on one side of the body (hemiparesis) is also a frequent symptom of brain hemorrhage. This is because each side of the brain controls the opposite side of the body. If the hemorrhage affects one side of the brain, it can cause weakness on the opposite side of the body.\n\n4. Headache is another common symptom of brain hemorrhage, as the bleeding increases pressure within the skull, which can cause pain.\n\n5.

Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland doesn't produce enough thyroid hormones. This can lead to various symptoms.\n\n3. Cold hands and feet are a common symptom of hypothyroidism.

With low thyroid hormone levels, the body's metabolism slows down, which can lead to a feeling of being cold, particularly in the extremities.\n\n4. Brittle nails can also be a symptom of hypothyroidism. Thyroid hormones are important for the growth and maintenance of hair and nails.
