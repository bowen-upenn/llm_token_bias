The broader justification of responding to rockets is more common than citing specific intelligence about a targeted site.\n\nOption (b) is possible, but Israeli statements on Gaza strikes tend to be more general about retaliating against rockets rather than giving specifics on the nature of targeted locations, likely to avoid revealing intelligence sources. So while (b) could be true, (a) aligns more closely with Israel's usual public messaging in these situations based on past incidents.\n\nOf course, more context would be needed to say definitively, but based just on these two options, (a) seems more probable as Israel's likely public statement.

The GOP attacks criticizing Hillary Clinton's handling of the Nigerian jihadist group Boko Haram while she was Secretary of State seem aimed at weakening her perceived strength on national security issues in anticipation of a potential 2016 presidential run. By questioning her decision not to add Boko Haram to the terror list, Republicans appear to be trying to portray Clinton as weak or misguided when it comes to dealing with terrorist threats, which could hurt her standing with voters who prioritize national security. So the likely motivation is to damage her 2016 prospects by casting doubt on her foreign policy and counter-terrorism judgment and credentials.",

In the immediate aftermath of such an incident, it is common that the full facts and motive are not yet known as authorities are still in the early stages of investigating. So the qualification that no motive is known yet because the investigation is still in progress is a reasonable and likely statement, more so than stating no motive is determined without that context.",

These steps go beyond the typical measures and demonstrate a strong commitment to preventing the spread of the flu.

Heavy rains have already occurred, leading to flooding and isolated mudslides. This indicates the soil is saturated with water.\n\n2. Road closures due to the mudslides suggest the mudslides were significant enough to cause disruptions.\n\n3. A winter storm warning remains in effect for the Sierra Nevada region, implying that more rain is expected. \n\nThe combination of already saturated soil from the heavy rains and the likelihood of continued rainfall based on the ongoing storm warning creates conditions that keep the risk of additional mudslides elevated over the next few days. Therefore, option (b) provides a more complete explanation for why mudslides are likely to remain a threat in the near term.",
