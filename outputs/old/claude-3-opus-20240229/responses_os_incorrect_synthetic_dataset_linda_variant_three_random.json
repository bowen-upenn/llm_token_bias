While both options include acidity, which is a common symptom associated with GERD, the addition of migraines in option (a) makes it less likely than option (b).\n\nGERD is a condition where stomach acid frequently flows back into the esophagus, causing irritation and discomfort. Common symptoms of GERD include heartburn, regurgitation, and chest pain. Acidity, or the sensation of stomach acid backing up into the throat, is a typical complaint among GERD patients.\n\nHowever, migraines are not typically associated with GERD. While some studies suggest a potential link between GERD and headaches, migraines are a specific type of headache disorder with distinct characteristics and triggers. There is no strong evidence to suggest that GERD significantly increases the likelihood of experiencing migraines.\n\nGiven the information provided about Maria's age, race, and GERD diagnosis, it is more probable that she experiences acidity as a related symptom, without the additional complication of migraines.",
