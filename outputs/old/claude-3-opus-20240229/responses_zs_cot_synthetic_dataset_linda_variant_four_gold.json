        "init_model_answer": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n(a) The Rolling Stones are one of the most successful and influential rock bands of all time. They have a massive global fanbase and their albums have consistently charted well in many countries over their nearly 60-year career. It's highly unlikely that a new album from such an iconic band would fail to chart in any country at all.\n\n(b) While it's possible that a new Stones album might underperform compared to their past releases, it's extremely improbable that it wouldn't chart anywhere given their enduring popularity. However, the second part about a sold-out world tour of major venues is much more plausible. The Rolling Stones continue to be a huge live draw and their concerts often sell out quickly, even in the largest stadiums around the world.\n\nSo in comparing the two options, (b) is clearly more likely than (a). Even if the album was a commercial disappointment, it's still highly likely to chart somewhere. But a sold-out global tour is very much in line with the ongoing success and appeal of The Rolling Stones as a live act.\n\nTherefore, I select option (b) as the more likely scenario: The album won't chart in any country but their world tour sells out all the major venues.",

Most of his movies have been well-received by critics and audiences alike. This suggests that a movie starring him is more likely to succeed than fail.\n\n2. However, even successful actors can sometimes be part of movies that don't do well. Critical backlash and box office failure are always possibilities, regardless of the star power involved.\n\n3. If the movie does receive critical backlash and fails at the box office, it's still possible for Leonardo DiCaprio's performance to be praised. Critics often single out strong acting performances even in otherwise poorly-received films.\n\n4. That said, it's less common for an actor to win a major award for a critically and commercially unsuccessful film. While it does happen occasionally, awards tend to favor films that have received a more positive overall reception.\n\n5. Therefore, the likelihood of Leonardo DiCaprio winning an award for his performance decreases if the movie is poorly received and fails at the box office.\n\nConsidering these points, I believe option (a) is more likely than option (b). While both scenarios are possible, it's more probable that a poorly received movie would simply fail without any award recognition for its lead actor.\n\nSo, my answer is (a) The movie receives critical backlash and fails at the box office.",

Even if he were to return to French politics today after many decades, it's likely that he would be able to quickly grasp and understand most modern political issues, given some time to study them. The fundamentals of politics - power, influence, governance - have not changed, even if specific issues have evolved.\n\n(2) De Gaulle was an iconic figure who played a pivotal role in 20th century French history. As the leader of the French Resistance during WWII and later as President, he earned immense respect and admiration. This enduring historical reputation would very likely help him gain a significant following if he were to return today.\n\n(3) In the modern media age, De Gaulle's charisma and historical stature would likely generate significant buzz and attention. Many French people would be curious to see and hear from this towering figure from their past. This could further amplify his ability to attract a following, even before fully engaging with modern issues.\n\n(4) That said, it's also possible that after studying modern issues, De Gaulle might take political positions that don't neatly align with current party structures or public opinion. His reputation could potentially sustain him politically even if his actual policy ideas were met with mixed reactions.\n\nGiven these considerations, I believe that option (b) is more likely: Even if there was an initial period where De Gaulle was getting up to speed on contemporary politics, his immense historical reputation and stature would still allow him to rapidly gain a significant following in modern French politics. His iconic status means that political support would likely accrue to him even before he fully engaged with the details of 21st century policy debates.",

As president, he gave many important speeches to rally the nation, such as his fireside chats. This suggests he would likely want to take the opportunity to speak to the American people again if resurrected.\n\n2. However, modern politics are quite different from FDR's era. Many of the specific issues and context have changed dramatically. FDR may feel he doesn't have enough understanding of the current landscape to give a speech that would do justice to the complexity of modern politics. This could give him pause about diving into a speech.\n\n3. That said, FDR was adept at speaking to core American values and the big picture. Even without going into policy specifics, he could likely give an inspiring, high-level speech drawing from his experience leading the nation through major crises. The novelty alone of a resurrected FDR would draw immense public interest.\n\n4. Additionally, simply having FDR suddenly resurrected would itself spark tremendous public fascination and discussion, regardless of whether he gave a speech. People would be re-examining his legacy, decisions and how the world has changed since his presidency. His presence alone would drive interest in historical political issues.\n\n5. Weighing these factors, while FDR may or may not feel fully equipped to give a speech on modern policy details, it seems likely he would give some form of public address to make the most of his miraculous day of resurrection. His skills as an orator and the unique circumstances suggest he would say something, even if not a full policy speech.\n\nTherefore, after analysis, I believe (b) is more likely - that even if FDR decided not to give a detailed speech on modern issues, his sudden presence would undoubtedly heighten public interest in historical political decisions and their modern relevance. The spectacle of his resurrection would spark immense reflection and discussion on its own.",

The first concert of a highly anticipated reunion tour is likely to draw a lot of attention and excitement from fans who have been waiting for this opportunity.\n\n4.

He believed in the power of love, compassion, and understanding to bring about change.\n\n3. Gandhi's influence: Gandhi inspired millions of people worldwide through his unwavering commitment to his principles. His philosophy and methods played a significant role in India's independence movement and have continued to influence civil rights movements and leaders globally.\n\n4. Consistency of character: Given Gandhi's strong moral compass and the consistency with which he lived his life according to his principles, it is highly unlikely that he would resort to aggressive or derogatory language, even in a modern political debate.\n\nTherefore, based on Gandhi's life, philosophy, and influence, option (b) is more likely: \"Gandhi uses aggressive and derogatory language but inspires millions to follow his philosophy of non-violent resistance.\" \n\nHowever, it is important to note that the second part of option (b) is far more plausible than the first part. Gandhi inspiring millions to follow his philosophy of non-violent resistance aligns with his historical impact, while the use of aggressive and derogatory language seems highly inconsistent with his character and beliefs.",

This alone makes her a significant historical figure worthy of global recognition.\n\n2) However, the Nobel Peace Prize is typically awarded to living individuals who have made outstanding contributions to the promotion of peace. Posthumous Nobel Peace Prizes are very rare. In fact, there has only been one posthumous Nobel Peace Prize in history, awarded to Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld in 1961.\n\n3) Given the rarity of posthumous Nobel Peace Prizes, it seems unlikely that Corazon Aquino would win the prize after her death, despite her significant contributions to democracy and peace in the Philippines.\n\n4) That said, even if she doesn't win the Nobel Peace Prize posthumously, her legacy as a champion of democracy is secure. Her efforts in leading the People Power Revolution and restoring democratic institutions in the Philippines are widely recognized and celebrated worldwide.\n\n5) Therefore, even without a posthumous Nobel Peace Prize, it is very likely that Corazon Aquino would continue to be celebrated worldwide for her democratic efforts in the Philippines.\n\nBased on these considerations, I would say that option (b) is more likely: Corazon Aquino doesn't win a posthumous Nobel Peace Prize, but is still celebrated worldwide for her democratic efforts in the Philippines.",

The Queen was known for her discretion and commitment to impartiality.\n\n(b) While it would be surprising and uncharacteristic for the Queen to express controversial political opinions, if she did, the book would almost certainly become a bestseller. Queen Elizabeth II was one of the most famous and respected global figures, reigning for over 70 years.

It's possible that Elon might partner with or use technology from other companies that are working on habitat design and construction.\n\n4. Therefore, between the two options, it seems more likely that Elon would still choose to fly with SpaceX to get to Mars, but he might use or collaborate with other companies' technologies for building a Mars habitat.\n\nSo, my answer is (b) Elon chooses to fly with SpaceX but uses technology from other companies to build a habitat on Mars.",

Moreover, if a single tops the charts in Canada, it would likely garner attention and airplay in other countries as well, further increasing the chances of the album charting in more than just one country.\n\nTherefore, based on the above points, I would select option (a) as more likely than option (b).

The Nobel Peace Prize can be awarded posthumously, but only if the recipient dies after the announcement of the prize in October. If a prize is awarded posthumously, the prize money is given to the estate of the deceased laureate.\n\n3.

However, even experienced investors like Bezos have backed failed startups before.\n\n3. Heavy continued investment from Bezos, even after initial struggles, could help keep a startup afloat and give it more runway to find traction and success.

She's a very successful pop star who has consistently released albums that have been commercially successful. Many of her albums have topped the Billboard charts.\n\n2) However, critical reception to her albums has been more mixed. While she's had some albums and songs that have been praised by critics, she's also had albums that have been criticized as being generic or lacking in depth.\n\n3) Now, let's consider the two scenarios:\n\n   (a) The album receives critically poor reviews.\n   This is certainly possible. Even successful artists sometimes release albums that are poorly received by critics.\n\n   (b) The album receives critically poor reviews but tops the Billboard charts.\n   This scenario is more specific. It's saying that despite poor reviews, the album will be a commercial success.\n\n4) Given Katy Perry's history of commercial success, even with mixed critical reception, I believe scenario (b) is more likely.\n\n   Her fan base is likely to support her new album regardless of critics, and her past success makes it likely that her new album will also perform well commercially, even if critics don't love it.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I believe option (b) is more likely: The album receives critically poor reviews but tops the Billboard charts.",

Bush would become the next celebrated artist in the contemporary art scene based purely on the artistic merits and innovation of his work. Here's why:\n- Bush has no formal art training or background that we know of. While not impossible, it would be exceedingly rare for someone to emerge as a celebrated artist with no prior experience or training.\n- The contemporary art world values innovation, unique perspectives and boundary-pushing work. As a novice painter, it's improbable Bush's landscapes would be cutting-edge enough to gain such acclaim.\n- There are many highly trained, experienced and talented artists vying for recognition. Bush would be an extreme outlier to surpass them as a novice.\n\n(b) It's more plausible that if Bush gained attention as an artist, it would be largely due to the novelty factor of him being a former U.S. president. Consider:\n- A president known for other things suddenly emerging as a painter would be an interesting human interest story that would generate curiosity and media attention.\n- His stature as a public figure could result in his paintings being publicized and exhibited not necessarily due to their quality but because of who he is.\n- The oddity of a president-turned-painter could cause his work to be talked about and even celebrated more for its uniqueness than its inherent artistic value.\n\nTherefore, after thinking it through, I believe option (b) is significantly more likely. While both are fairly improbable, Bush gaining artistic notoriety primarily for the novelty of his prior role is far more plausible than him becoming a groundbreaking artist celebrated purely for creative genius and innovation as a beginner. The curiosity factor around a president's paintings could outweigh the artistic merits in making him a celebrated figure.",

Two of the most significant were his efforts to improve interfaith relations, especially with Judaism and Islam, and his role in the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe. \n\n3) When a pope is canonized, it is typical for their major life works and contributions to be celebrated and highlighted. It would be unusual for one of their key areas of impact to be completely unrecognized.\n\n4) Between the two options given, (b) is more likely because while it states he is not recognized for his interfaith work, it does acknowledge his role in the fall of Communism. \n\n5) Option (a), on the other hand, suggests he is not recognized for his interfaith efforts and says nothing about his other contributions being celebrated. This seems less probable if he is being honored with sainthood.\n\nTherefore, after considering the options, I would say that (b) is more likely: If Pope John Paul II is canonized, he may not be specifically recognized for improving interfaith relations, but he is very likely to be celebrated for his role in helping end Communist rule in Eastern Europe.",

His previous albums have consistently performed very well on the charts. Given his track record, it's quite likely that his new album will also be a commercial success.\n\n2. For option (a) to be true, Ed Sheeran's album would have to significantly underperform compared to his previous releases. While this is possible, it seems unlikely given his consistent success.\n\n3. Option (b) presents a scenario where the album as a whole doesn't reach the top 10, but a single from the album tops the charts for several weeks.\n\n4. It's more common for an album to perform well if it contains a hit single that tops the charts for an extended period. A highly successful single usually drives album sales and boosts the album's chart position.\n\n5. For option (b) to occur, the album would have to underperform despite having a very successful single. This is a less likely scenario than the album simply performing well overall.\n\nConsidering these points, I believe option (a) is more likely than option (b). While neither scenario is extremely likely given Ed Sheeran's track record, it's more plausible that the album simply wouldn't reach the top 10 than it would have a chart-topping single but still fail to reach the top 10 as an album.\n\nTherefore, my answer is (a) The album doesn't reach the top 10 on the Billboard charts.",

While not impossible, it's less common for poorly reviewed films to gross that highly, even with a major star.\n\n5) Without knowing more specifics about the movie (budget, marketing, competition, etc.), the safer bet based on typical outcomes would be that a poorly reviewed film is more likely to make less than $500 million.\n\nTherefore, I believe (a) is more likely - that the hypothetical new Robert Downey Jr. action movie, if it receives poor reviews, is more likely to gross under $500 million worldwide than over that amount. The poor reviews are more probable to somewhat limit its financial ceiling, even with RDJ's star power.",

His views were a core part of his identity and his radio persona.\n\n2. Changing one's deeply held political views is not something that happens often, especially for someone like Limbaugh who built a career on expressing those views. It would be a dramatic shift.\n\n3. Even if Limbaugh did change his views, his existing audience was attracted to him largely because they agreed with his conservative perspective. If he shifted to expressing different political views, he would likely alienate a large portion of his established audience.\n\n4. Building a new audience to replace the one he would lose would be challenging. His reputation and brand were so tied to his conservative views that attracting a new, politically different audience would be an uphill battle.\n\nGiven these considerations, I believe that option (b) is less likely than option (a). \n\nWhile both scenarios are improbable, it's more plausible that Limbaugh would change his views (option a) than it is that he would change his views and still maintain high ratings and a large audience (option b).\n\nTherefore, my answer is (a) - it is more likely that Rush Limbaugh would entirely change his political views than it is that he would change his views but continue to have high ratings and a large audience.",

While Pope Francis is generally seen as a progressive and reformist pope, he still adheres to many traditional Catholic teachings.\n2. It is less likely that he would include highly controversial opinions in his book, as it could risk alienating parts of his global following.\n3. His public persona is one of unity and bridge-building, so he may avoid stirring up unnecessary controversy.\n4. Even if the book contains some mildly controversial opinions, it is unlikely to overshadow the overall interest in the book.\n\nBased on these points, I believe option (a) is more likely.

However, even successful authors can face criticism for new works, especially if they differ in style or genre from their previous successes. The initial reception may be mixed as critics and readers adjust their expectations.\n\n3.

As mentioned earlier, Chiang Kai-shek and Madame Chiang Kai-shek are no longer alive, making it impossible for them to garner domestic support through a diplomatic event.\n\n2. The Republic of China (ROC), which they led, now only governs the island of Taiwan and a few minor islands. The domestic support in Taiwan for the Chiangs has declined over the years, with the democratization of Taiwan and the rise of native Taiwanese political parties.\n\nTherefore, considering the impossibility of the scenario due to the Chiangs being deceased, option (a) is more likely than option (b). An event held in their name might receive international media coverage due to its unusual nature, but it cannot strengthen domestic support for the late leaders.",

Many people trust her recommendations and are likely to at least check out a new project she's involved with.\n\n3. Even if the podcast receives mediocre reviews from critics, Oprah's name recognition and loyal following are likely to draw in a large number of listeners.\n\n4. Oprah's marketing team and the promotion around the podcast would be extensive, further increasing the likelihood of attracting a large subscriber base.\n\n5. There are precedents for projects or products endorsed by Oprah achieving massive success, even without being critically acclaimed (e.g., books featured in Oprah's Book Club becoming bestsellers).\n\nConsidering these factors, I believe option (b) is more likely: Even if Oprah's new wellness podcast receives mediocre reviews, it is still likely to gain millions of subscribers due to her immense influence, existing fan base, and the strong promotion it would receive.",

        "init_model_answer": "Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. Borman and Lovell are real-life astronauts from the Apollo missions, not professional actors. This suggests that the movie might be focused more on realism and historical accuracy than on the typical elements that often lead to winning awards, such as exceptional acting performances or groundbreaking cinematography.\n\n2. Space adventure movies have a track record of being popular with audiences, as evidenced by the success of franchises like Star Wars and Star Trek, as well as films like Gravity and The Martian. This indicates that there is a significant market for this genre, and a well-made space adventure film has the potential to attract a large audience and become a box office hit.\n\n3. However, the fact that the movie stars non-professional actors might limit its appeal to some extent, as audiences often are drawn to films with recognizable stars. This could potentially impact its box office performance.\n\n4. Winning major awards often requires a combination of critical acclaim, artistic merit, and strong industry support. While a space adventure film with Borman and Lovell could potentially earn praise for its realism and historical significance, it may face challenges in securing the kind of broad-based support needed to win major awards, especially if it is seen primarily as a commercial venture.\n\nGiven these factors, I believe that option (a) is more likely: The movie wins no awards. While the film has the potential to be a box office success due to the popularity of the space adventure genre, the involvement of non-professional actors and the potential emphasis on realism over artistic considerations may limit its chances of winning major awards.",

Which is more likely:  \n(a) He struggles to understand contemporary geopolitics.  \n(b) He struggles to understand contemporary geopolitics but eventually brokers a groundbreaking international agreement.",
        "target_answer": "(a) He struggles to understand contemporary geopolitics",
        "retry": false,
        "use_multi_agents": false,
        "init_model_answer": "Okay, let's consider this step-by-step:\n\n1. George C. Marshall was a brilliant statesman and diplomat. He served as U.S. Secretary of State from 1947 to 1949 and was the architect of the Marshall Plan, which helped rebuild Western Europe after World War II. This demonstrates his exceptional ability to understand and navigate complex geopolitical situations.\n\n2. However, the world has changed dramatically since Marshall's time. The Cold War, which dominated geopolitics in his era, has ended. New powers have emerged, like China and India. Technology has transformed global communications and economies. Many of today's pressing issues - like terrorism, climate change, and cybersecurity - were not major concerns in the late 1940s.\n\n3. Given this, it's likely that Marshall would indeed struggle, at least initially, to fully grasp the intricacies of contemporary geopolitics (a). The specific countries, leaders, technologies, and issues have changed so much. He would need time to study and acclimate to this new global context.\n\n4. Yet, Marshall's core skills - his intelligence, strategic thinking, diplomacy, leadership, and commitment to international cooperation - would still be highly relevant. Once he understood the new landscape, he could likely apply these skills effectively. \n\n5. Brokering a groundbreaking international agreement (b) would be challenging. It requires not just skill but also the right opportunities and partners. However, with his proven abilities, it's plausible Marshall could achieve this if the circumstances aligned.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe (a) is more likely - Marshall would probably struggle to understand contemporary geopolitics at first. However, given time and his considerable talents, he could potentially go on to make significant contributions, even if a groundbreaking agreement is less certain.",

Kamala Harris' current position: As the sitting Vice President, Kamala Harris has a high profile and significant political experience. This could give her an advantage in the primary elections.\n\n2. Incumbent Presidents: Historically, incumbent Presidents have a strong advantage in securing their party's nomination for a second term. If Joe Biden chooses to run for re-election in 2024, it's likely that he would secure the Democratic nomination.\n\n3. Open primaries: However, if Joe Biden does not run for re-election, the Democratic primary would be wide open. In this scenario, Kamala Harris would likely face significant competition from other high-profile Democrats.\n\n4. Kamala Harris' popularity: While Harris has a strong base of support, she has also faced criticism from some progressives within the Democratic party. This could hurt her chances in a competitive primary.\n\n5. Vice Presidential nomination: If Harris does lose in the primary elections, it's possible but not guaranteed that she would be chosen as the vice-presidential candidate again. This would depend on who wins the Democratic nomination and their strategic considerations in choosing a running mate.\n\nGiven these factors, I believe option (a) is more likely: Kamala Harris will lose in the primary elections. The open primary would be highly competitive, and while Harris has some advantages, she would also face significant challenges.\n\nOption (b), while possible, is less likely. Even if Harris loses the primary, the presidential nominee would have to choose her again as the vice-presidential candidate, which is not guaranteed.",

        "init_model_answer": "Let's think this through step by step:\n\n(a) It's quite unlikely that Khrushchev would receive a standing ovation from everyone present at the UN, given the tensions between the Soviet Union and the West during the Cold War era when Khrushchev led the USSR. His policies and rhetoric were often controversial and divisive on the international stage.\n\n(b) This scenario refers to a famous incident that actually occurred. In 1960, during a UN General Assembly meeting, Khrushchev did bang his shoe on his desk in protest or to get attention, although accounts differ on the exact reason and moment he did so. However, this happened during a highly contentious speech, not after a standing ovation.\n\nGiven these factors, I would say that option (a) is more likely than option (b). While neither scenario is particularly probable, receiving unanimous applause seems more plausible than the highly specific shoe-banging incident repeating itself, especially after everyone supposedly applauded him.\n\nTherefore, my answer is (a) He will receive a standing ovation from all present.",

His strict Islamist ideology would likely not resonate with a broad American readership.\n\n(b) While it's still unlikely that Khomeini's book would be a bestseller in the USA for the reasons mentioned above, this option adds the caveat that the book would be heavily criticized by Western scholars. This seems more plausible. If Khomeini's book did gain significant attention in the West, it would almost certainly face strong criticism from Western political philosophers and commentators who disagree with his ideology and the policies he implemented as Iran's leader.\n\nTherefore, option (b) seems more likely: while a bestseller status in the USA is improbable, heavy criticism from Western scholars would be expected if Khomeini's book did gain a wide readership.",

He was instrumental in China's economic reform and opening up to the world.\n\n(2) Deng's economic policies were characterized by a pragmatic approach, often summed up by his famous quote, \"It doesn't matter whether a cat is black or white, as long as it catches mice.\" This suggests he was more concerned with practical results than ideological purity.\n\n(3) Under Deng's leadership, China moved away from a centrally planned economy and introduced market principles. However, this was not a complete free-market system. It was a unique blend of market economics under a socialist political framework, often referred to as \"Socialism with Chinese characteristics.\"\n\n(4) Key industries, such as energy, telecommunications, and banking, remained under state control during Deng's era and continue to be so today. This allows the state to maintain strategic control over the economy.\n\n(5) Given Deng's pragmatic approach and the historical context of maintaining state control over key industries, it seems unlikely that he would implement a completely free-market system if he were advising on China's economic policies in 2023.\n\nTherefore, option (b) \"He implements a completely free-market system but maintains strong state control over key industries\" seems more in line with Deng's economic thinking and the general direction of China's economic policies since the reform and opening up.",

        "retry": false,
        "use_multi_agents": false,
        "init_model_answer": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. John J. Sirica was the chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia who presided over the Watergate trials in the 1970s. He played a crucial role in exposing the Watergate scandal and ensuring that justice was served.\n\n2. Throughout the Watergate trials, Sirica demonstrated a strong commitment to upholding the law and the integrity of the legal process. He was known for his tough questioning and his unwillingness to accept evasive answers from witnesses.\n\n3. Sirica's actions during the Watergate trials suggest that he had a strong sense of legal ethics and a commitment to the rule of law. He was willing to make unpopular decisions and face criticism in order to ensure that the truth was revealed and that those responsible for wrongdoing were held accountable.\n\n4. Given Sirica's track record, it seems unlikely that he would compromise his legal principles in another major political trial. His actions during the Watergate trials suggest that he would be more likely to uphold the integrity of the legal process, even if it meant making difficult or unpopular decisions.\n\n5. However, it's also possible that the pressures and stakes of another major political trial could lead Sirica to make compromises in order to achieve what he sees as a just outcome. He might bend the rules or interpret the law in ways that some would see as compromising his principles.\n\n6. Ultimately, though, Sirica's history suggests that even if he did make some compromises, he would still work to uphold the overall integrity of the legal process. He would be unlikely to completely abandon his principles or to allow political considerations to override his commitment to the rule of law.\n\nBased on this analysis, I would select option (b): if John J. Sirica were to become a central figure in another major political trial, he would be more likely to compromise his legal principles but ultimately uphold the integrity of the legal process.",
