However, it does not explicitly state that she loves being a stay at home mom. While it's certainly possible she enjoys this role, we cannot assume that with certainty based solely on the details given. The fact that she originally wanted to be a police officer before falling in love and starting a family leaves open the possibility that being a stay at home mom may not have been her first choice or greatest passion.\n\nTherefore, while both (a) and (b) are quite plausible, (a) aligns more closely with just the facts presented in the passage. Stating she cares for her family because she loves being a stay at home mom makes an additional assumption beyond what is directly supported by the information provided.",

This suggests a strong determination to go to that particular school.\n\nBy taking a year off to travel the world, Mike would gain valuable life experiences and perspectives that could strengthen his college application. He would have more to write about in essays and discuss in interviews. The time off also gives him a chance to pursue other aspects that could bolster his application, like volunteering, work experience, projects, etc.\n\nSince Mike was so focused on Harvard to begin with, it's likely that drive would lead him to reapply after his gap year, leveraging his travels and any other productive experiences from the year to present an even stronger application to Harvard the second time around. So (b) is the more probable scenario given Mike's original intent and the potential benefits of his year off.",

The simpler and more direct inference is simply that after dropping his glasses, he would pick them up off the pavement, without specifying his thought process or realization about needing them to see. So (a) sticks more closely to the known facts, while (b) brings in an additional unstated assumption.",

However, this extra information is not directly supported by the given context. The passage only mentions that Jennifer and her husband found a perfect apartment but had to live in a tent for a month while waiting for it to be ready. There are no details about Jennifer's personal preferences for organizing or setting up her home.\n\nIn the absence of such specific information, the more concise and direct statement in option (a) is more likely to be true based solely on the given context.",

Losing vision suddenly after head trauma is a serious medical issue that most people would seek help for.\n\nSo while (b) could possibly be true, (a) more concisely captures the key inference supported by the information given - that Kyle would very likely seek medical attention in this concerning situation.

It connects his actions (refusing to drop classes despite exhaustion) and their consequences (getting kicked out of the honors program due to his GPA falling) to his probable state of being overwhelmed and concerned about his academic standing. This additional detail makes option (b) a more likely and complete explanation compared to the more generic statement in option (a).",
