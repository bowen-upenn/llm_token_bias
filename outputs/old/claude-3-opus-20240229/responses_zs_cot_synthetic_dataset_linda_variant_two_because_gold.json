Some companies have policies about employees discussing their work on social media. Announcing your job prematurely could inadvertently violate such a policy.\n\n2. Your new employer may want to coordinate the timing and messaging around new hires for consistency or to align with other company announcements.\n\n3.

They are not typically involved in mediating political talks between countries.\n2. The talks are specifically about family reunions between North and South Korea. This is a sensitive bilateral issue that the two countries would likely handle directly, without involving a third party.\n\n(b) IRC sending delegates to mediate the talks to be held in North Korea because they believe it will lead to a peaceful resolution between the two countries.\n\nThis option is even more unlikely because:\n1. It has the same issues as option (a) regarding the IRC's typical role and involvement.\n2. The talks are focused on a very specific humanitarian issue of family reunions, not the broader political tensions and conflict between North and South Korea. So the talks, even if successful, are unlikely to directly lead to an overall \"peaceful resolution between the two countries.\"\n\nTherefore, after analyzing the options, (a) is more likely than (b), but both seem quite unlikely given the context provided about the nature and purpose of the talks.",

This is a plausible explanation, as it's common for the opposing party to criticize potential presidential candidates on their past record.\n\n3. Option (b) goes a step further, specifying that the attacks aim to portray Clinton as weak on national security, which could hurt her in a presidential campaign. The failure to add Boko Haram to the terror list could be framed as a national security misstep.\n\n4. National security is often a key issue in presidential campaigns. A perceived weakness in this area could indeed be damaging to a candidate.\n\n5. So while option (a) is a valid possibility, option (b) provides a more specific and potentially more impactful reason for the GOP attacks.\n\nTherefore, after analyzing the options, I would select (b) as the more likely explanation:\n\nThe GOP attacks seek to weaken Clinton for her possible 2016 presidential run because people believe that criticism of her handling of the Nigerian jihadist group shows weakness in national security decision-making.",

The news mentions that heavy rains led to isolated mudslides and road closures in Kern County. This indicates the rains were significant enough to cause mudslides.\n\n2. When soil becomes saturated with water from heavy rains, it loses cohesion and stability, making it more prone to mudslides, especially in hilly or mountainous areas. \n\n3. The article states a winter storm warning is in effect for the Sierra Nevada, suggesting more rain and snow are expected. Additional precipitation will further saturate the soil.\n\n4. Since the soil is already waterlogged from the recent heavy rains, the threat of mudslides will likely persist for the next few days, particularly if more rain falls on the already saturated ground.\n\n5. While option (a) is plausible, it doesn't provide the reasoning connecting the heavy rains to the continued mudslide risk that option (b) does. The added explanation in (b) makes it a more complete and likely answer.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and the causal link between the heavy rains, saturated soil, and continued mudslide risk outlined in option (b), that is the choice I believe is more likely to be accurate.",
