The question presents two options: \n   (a) Seeking medical attention for the bee sting\n   (b) Seeking medical attention for the bee sting due to an allergy\n\n2. The probability of (a) is the probability of seeking medical attention after any bee sting, regardless of the reason.\n\n3. The probability of (b) is the probability of seeking medical attention after a bee sting specifically due to an allergy.\n\n4. Bee sting allergies are relatively rare. Most people who get stung by a bee do not require medical attention.\n\n5. Therefore, the probability of seeking medical attention for any bee sting, P(a), is greater than the probability of seeking medical attention for a bee sting due to an allergy, P(b).\n\n6. This is because P(b) is a subset of P(a) - all allergic reactions requiring medical attention are included within the set of all bee stings requiring medical attention, but not vice versa.\n\n7. Mathematically, P(a) \u2265 P(b), as P(b) is a conjunction of two events (bee sting AND allergy), while P(a) is a single event (bee sting). \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) - it is more likely that the protagonist would seek medical attention for the bee sting, regardless of the reason, than specifically due to an allergy. The additional information in (b) makes it a less probable scenario.",
