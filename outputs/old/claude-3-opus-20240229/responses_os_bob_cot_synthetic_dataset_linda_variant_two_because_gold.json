While this statement about human nature may be true, it doesn't directly address whether the recorded sounds are likely to be helpful in this specific case.\n\nThe question is asking which possibility is \"more likely\" based on the limited information provided.

However, the FBI likely wouldn't have obtained the video if they didn't think it had at least some potential to provide useful information.\n\nTherefore, while we should be cautious about drawing firm conclusions, (a) appears more likely - the recorded sounds could potentially be a meaningful piece of the larger puzzle, even if not definitively so.

This aligns well with the goal of changing women's status mentioned in the question.\n\n3. Option (b) includes the same statement as (a), but adds an additional reason - that the candidate believes it is essential to fight for gender equality within the political system.\n\n4. While both options are plausible given the information in the question, option (a) is a more concise and direct statement that aligns with the question. Option (b) adds an additional detail that, while relevant, is not necessary to answer the question of which is more likely.\n\n5.

The Republicans are criticizing Hillary Clinton's handling of the Nigerian jihadist group Boko Haram when she was Secretary of State. Specifically, they point out that under her leadership, the State Department did not add Boko Haram to the terror list.\n\n2. A former State Department official argues that the issue is not straightforward, suggesting there may have been valid reasons for not adding Boko Haram to the list at that time. \n\n3. The question asks which is more likely: \n(a) The GOP attacks seek to weaken Clinton for her possible 2016 presidential run, or \n(b) The same as (a), but with the additional reason that people believe the criticism shows weakness in her national security decision-making.\n\n4. Both (a) and (b) state that the GOP's motivation is to weaken Clinton ahead of a potential 2016 presidential run. This seems very plausible, as it's common for opposition parties to criticize potential rivals.\n\n5. The difference is that (b) adds a specific reason why the criticism could be effective: people may see it as exposing a weakness in Clinton's national security credentials. \n\n6. National security is often a key issue in presidential campaigns. A perceived weakness in this area could indeed hurt a candidate. So the reasoning in (b) is sound.\n\nTherefore, while both (a) and (b) are plausible, (b) provides a more complete and convincing explanation for the GOP's motivation. The additional context in (b) makes it the more likely option.\n\nSo in conclusion, (b) is more likely: The GOP attacks seek to weaken Clinton for her possible 2016 presidential run because people believe that criticism of her handling of the Nigerian jihadist group shows weakness in national security decision-making.",

Its location could be strategically advantageous, especially if it's easily accessible from other major UAE cities like Dubai.\n\n3. The fact that RAK is often overlooked compared to Dubai and Abu Dhabi could mean:\n   a) There is less competition and saturation in RAK's luxury property market compared to Dubai and Abu Dhabi.\n   b) Property and development costs may be lower in RAK than in Dubai or Abu Dhabi.\n\n4.
