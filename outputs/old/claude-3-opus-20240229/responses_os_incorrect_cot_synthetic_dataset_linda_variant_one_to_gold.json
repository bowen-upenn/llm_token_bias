To address this, Jordan bought a new pair of bigger pants that fit him perfectly. \n\n3. Jordan was happy with the new pants because they were no longer too tight, implying he found them comfortable.\n\n4. Since the new pants fit well and made Jordan happy, it's very likely he would continue wearing them regularly, including to common places like work.\n\n5. While both statements about Jordan continuing to wear the pants are likely true, statement (a) is more broad, covering him wearing the pants in general. Statement (b) is more specific, only referring to him wearing the pants to work.\n\n6. In probability, a more general statement is more likely to be true than a more specific one. The specific statement (b) cannot be more probable than the general statement (a) which encompasses it.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) Jordan would continue wearing the new pair of pants. This general statement is more probable than the specific case of only wearing them to work.",

Marty, as a parent, would likely be concerned about Rick's dental health and want to motivate him to start flossing.\n\n5. Option (a) suggests that Marty would increase the reward to motivate Rick to floss, which is a reasonable assumption based on her initial reward system.\n\n6. Option (b) also suggests that Marty would increase the reward, but specifically mentions that her motivation would be to help Rick avoid further dental issues like gingivitis.\n\n7. Given that Rick has already experienced a negative consequence (gingivitis) due to not flossing, it is more likely that Marty's primary concern would be to prevent further dental problems.\n\nTherefore, option (b) \"Marty would likely increase the reward to motivate Rick to floss to avoid further dental issues like gingivitis\" seems more probable, as it takes into account the specific context of Rick's gingivitis and Marty's likely concern for his dental health.",

The passage states that Brandon \"felt captive to [the painting], a slave.\" This suggests he had an intense, even obsessive fascination with the artwork. \n\n3. When the painting fell and was damaged, it's reasonable to infer that Brandon would want to fix it given how strongly he seemed to feel about it. Attempting repair seems highly likely.\n\n4.

The phrasing \"tried yet again to start over\" indicates this is not the first time they have attempted to leave this situation and begin anew elsewhere.

As a single parent with a newborn, it's probable the protagonist will need financial and childcare assistance to successfully establish a new life apart from the abusive parent.

The question provides additional context in option (b) that is not present in the original scenario - specifically, that there is an \"ongoing storm\". This is an important piece of information that would influence the captain's decision making and priorities.\n\n2. In the original scenario, the captain notices a loose board and orders a crew member to fix it. When the crew member refuses, the captain has him thrown in the brig. This suggests the captain considers the repair important and won't tolerate insubordination, but there's no indication of special urgency.\n\n3. Option (a) suggests the straightforward next step of finding another crew member to complete the repair the first one refused. This aligns with the original scenario.\n\n4. However, option (b) introduces the context of an ongoing storm. In a storm situation, the captain's top priority would be the immediate safety of the ship and crew. A loose board could present a serious and urgent risk in a storm. In this context, the captain would be even more determined to get the repair done quickly by someone else.\n\n5. The additional detail in (b) about the storm provides a stronger motivation for the captain's actions than the baseline scenario. Safety in a storm is a more pressing reason to insist on the repair than simply noticing a loose board under normal conditions.\n\nTherefore, considering the additional contextual information and the greater urgency it implies, option (b) is more likely: The protagonist, the ship captain, would likely find another crew member to fix the loose board to ensure the safety of all on board during the ongoing storm.",

Scenario (a) doesn't specify whether Jasmine will find her ring or not. It only states that she might continue searching.\n\n3. Scenario (b) states that Jasmine will not only continue searching but also successfully recover her ring.\n\n4. In general, the probability of finding a lost item is lower than not finding it, especially if it's lost in a public place like a beach where many people visit.\n\n5. Adding the condition of successfully recovering the ring makes scenario (b) more specific and therefore less probable compared to scenario (a).\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is (a) Jasmine might return to the beach later to continue searching for her ring. This scenario is more likely because it doesn't make any claims about the outcome of her search, whereas scenario (b) assumes a successful recovery which is less probable.",

After finding out his credit score was good enough to get a decent price (but not great), Tom worked harder to improve his score. This indicates that Tom realized the importance of a good credit score and took action to improve it.\n\n3. Option (a) states that Tom would continue to monitor and improve his credit score. Given his recent efforts to improve his score, it's likely he would continue this behavior.\n\n4.

In reality, one cannot simply decide to get a job as a post office manager on the spot just because the line is not moving. There are hiring processes, qualifications, etc. that would prevent this.\n\n2. However, for the sake of argument, let's assume this unlikely scenario occurred. The next step is to compare the two given options:\n\n   (a) The protagonist would likely improve the efficiency of the post office operations.\n   (b) The protagonist would likely improve the efficiency of the post office operations to better accommodate the growing number of online parcel bookings.\n\n3. Option (a) is a more general statement, suggesting that the protagonist's leadership would improve the overall efficiency of the post office.\n\n4. Option (b) is more specific.

When comparing the probability of two events, where one event is a subset of the other, the more general event is always more probable.

The critical element is that they follow through on their plan to see each other again, not the specifics of the date.\n\n3. While wanting to impress a date is common, going to the extent of an expensive dinner is not a given, especially for a first date that came about unexpectedly.

Seeking to prove his innocence would be the most immediate concern for the innocent twin. He would likely want to provide evidence of his innocence, such as an alibi or witness testimony, to get the charges dropped as quickly as possible.\n\n3. Once he has proven his innocence and been released, the innocent twin may feel angry and mistreated by the store and the justice system.

Moreover, when Jake drove to her house, she didn't open the door to let him in. This further shows that she's not willing to engage with him at the moment.\n\n4. Option (a) states that Maria might ignore Jake's further attempts to contact her. This is likely, given her current behavior of rejecting his calls and not opening the door for him.\n\n5. Option (b) also states that Maria might ignore Jake's further attempts, but adds the reason \"to make him realize how upset she is.\"\n\n6. Considering Maria's actions, it's reasonable to infer that she's ignoring Jake to show him how upset she is. Her behavior seems to be a deliberate response to his actions.\n\nTherefore, option (b) \"Maria might ignore Jake's further attempts to contact her to make him realize how upset she is\" is more likely.

The brother lives six hours away, which is a considerable distance and may make frequent visits challenging.\n\n4. The brother is about to buy a house, which is a significant life event.\n\n5. The protagonist is glad their brother is doing well but wishes they knew him better, indicating a desire for a closer relationship.\n\nConsidering these points, option (b) is more likely. The purchase of a new house is a major milestone and a cause for celebration. Given the distant nature of their relationship and the protagonist's desire to know their brother better, this significant event would likely prompt the protagonist to plan a visit specifically to celebrate the new house purchase.\n\nWhile option (a) suggests the protagonist would plan a visit, it doesn't provide a specific reason for the visit. The brother's house purchase in option (b) serves as a more compelling reason for the protagonist to make the effort to visit, despite the distance and their infrequent contact.\n\nTherefore, option (b) is more likely: The protagonist would likely plan a visit to see their brother to celebrate the purchase of his new house.",

When a group of kids approached and asked him to play, the passage states \"Derek was relieved to have someone to play with.\" This relief implies he wanted to join them and play.\n\n4. While both options have Derek joining the group to play, option (b) adds the motivation of making new friends. Given the context that Derek is new, alone, and relieved to have someone to play with, it's reasonable to infer that part of his motivation for joining them would be to make new friends at his new school.\n\n5. Option (a) is fully contained within option (b). Option (b) simply extends (a) with additional likely motivation. There's no reason to prefer the simpler explanation in (a) when (b) adds very plausible details.\n\nTherefore, considering all the context, I believe (b) is the more likely scenario - that Derek would join the group of kids to play in order to make new friends.

Option (a) states that Dottie would likely start jumping rope in her own yard. This aligns with the information given in the passage. Dottie went through the effort to secretly obtain the jump rope, so it's reasonable to infer she would use it for its intended purpose of jumping rope.\n\n3.

Without more information about Dixie's financial situation and priorities, we can't assume that saving money will be her primary motivation in the future.\n\nTherefore, I would choose option (a). Based on the information given, it's more likely that Dixie will buy a used washing machine again due to her positive experience, rather than specifically to save money.

The additional detail in option (b) about Christian using the tablet to \"catch up with the latest TV shows and movies\" is a reasonable assumption based on the context, but it is not explicitly stated in the original information.\n\nTherefore, while both options are plausible, I would choose option (a) as the more likely scenario based on the given information. Option (a) directly follows from the context, while option (b) includes an additional assumption that, although reasonable, is not explicitly supported by the provided details.",

However, when the gifts were opened, Tom realized that all the other gifts were \"Roll Tide\" themed, which is specifically associated with the University of Alabama's football team, the Crimson Tide.\n\n4. This suggests that Tom's sister meant her husband was a fan of the Alabama Crimson Tide football team, not just the state of Alabama in general.\n\n5.

It assumes that taking the pills will definitely make Gregory feel better soon, which may not necessarily be the case. The doctor's intention is for Gregory to feel better, but the outcome isn't certain.\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is (a) Gregory would take the pills given by Doctor Gemma.
