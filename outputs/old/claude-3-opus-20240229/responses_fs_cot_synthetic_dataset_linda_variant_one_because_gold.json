They visited an urgent care center, suggesting that the cough was concerning enough to seek medical attention.\n3. The doctor's assistant examined the wife, ordered an X-ray, and prescribed three medications, indicating a thorough evaluation and treatment plan.\n4. The protagonist expresses hope that the medications will work, showing concern for his wife's well-being and a desire for her recovery.\n\nGiven the protagonist's concern for his wife's health and the fact that they sought medical attention and received prescribed medications, it is highly likely that the protagonist would administer or ensure his wife takes the prescribed medications (option a). This action aligns with his desire to see her recover quickly.\n\nWhile option (b) provides additional context for the protagonist's motivation, it does not make the action of administering the medication more likely than option (a) alone. The concern for his wife's health is already implied in the given information.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) The protagonist would likely administer or ensure his wife takes the prescribed medications.",

Option (b) offers a specific reason why Paul would play with his hermit crab - because he found it to be a funny and enjoyable way to spend time.\n\n4. The passage mentions that Paul thought the crab was \"silly and fun to play with\", which aligns with the reasoning provided in option (b).\n\n5. According to the conjunction fallacy, the probability of two events occurring together (in this case, Paul playing with the hermit crab AND finding it funny and enjoyable) is always less than or equal to the probability of either event occurring alone.\n\nTherefore, option (a) is more likely than option (b), as it does not include the additional condition of Paul finding the crab funny and enjoyable.\n\nThe correct answer is (a) Paul would play with his hermit crab.",

However, this detail was already provided in the background information - we already know the shirt was autographed by Ben's favorite wrestler.\n\n3. The additional information in statement (b) doesn't change the likelihood of Ben framing the shirt compared to statement (a). The key reason for framing the shirt is to preserve the special memory, which is equally conveyed in both statements.\n\n4. According to the conjunction fallacy, the probability of two events occurring together (in \"conjunction\") is always less than or equal to the probability of either one occurring alone. In this case, statement (b) is a conjunction of statement (a) and an additional condition, so it cannot be more likely than statement (a) alone.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) Ben might frame the autographed shirt to preserve the memory. Statement (b) cannot be more likely, as it just adds a detail already known from the background information.",

This is quite likely, as joining a club or group is a common way for students to get involved in their new school and pursue their interests.\n\n3.

The passage tells us about her initial difficulty making friends, but it also says she finally started fitting in. It doesn't specify that she still feels a strong need to make more friends.\n\n5. According to the conjunction fallacy, adding extra details to an option can make it seem more specific and therefore more likely, even though logically, the probability of two things being true together (A and B) is always less than or equal to the probability of just one of those things being true (A).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) Julie might join a club or group that interests her.
