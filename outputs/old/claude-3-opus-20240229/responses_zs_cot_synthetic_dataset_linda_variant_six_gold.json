The probability of a specific sequence occurring is the product of the probabilities of each individual outcome.\n\n   (a) For VVVVOOO:\n       P(VVVVOOO) = (3/8) * (3/8) * (3/8) * (3/8) * (5/8) * (5/8) * (5/8) = 0.0016\n\n   (b) For VVOVOOO:\n       P(VVOVOOO) = (3/8) * (3/8) * (5/8) * (3/8) * (5/8) * (5/8) * (5/8) = 0.0023\n\n   (c) For VVVOOO:\n       P(VVVOOO) = (3/8) * (3/8) * (3/8) * (5/8) * (5/8) * (5/8) = 0.0041\n\n3) The sequence with the highest probability is the one you should choose to bet on, as it has the highest chance of occurring.\n\n   The highest probability is for sequence (c) VVVOOO, with a probability of 0.0041.\n\nTherefore, the sequence I would prefer to bet on is (c) VVVOOO.",
