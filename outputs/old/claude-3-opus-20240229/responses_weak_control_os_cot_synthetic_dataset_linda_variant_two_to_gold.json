These facts are very likely to be true given the ship's historic nature.\n\n(b) includes the same facts as (a), but adds the additional condition that the ship will avoid being scrapped by being turned into an entertainment complex and museum. This is a more specific scenario that is less certain.\n\nThe conjunction fallacy is the tendency to think that specific conditions are more probable than general ones. However, probability theory dictates that the probability of two events occurring together (in \"conjunction\") is always less than or equal to the probability of either one occurring alone.\n\nTherefore, even though (b) may seem more plausible given the additional context, (a) is still more probable as it has fewer conditions that need to be met.\n\nSo the correct answer is (a) - it is more likely that the ship set the trans-Atlantic speed record and hosted stars like Grace Kelly and Duke Ellington, without specifying its fate. The probability of it also being converted to an entertainment complex is less than the probability of the historical facts alone being true.",

The key facts presented are:\n   - Netanyahu says Jewish building in East Jerusalem will continue\n   - Hillary Clinton says U.S. commitment to Israel is \"unwavering, enduring and forever\"\n   - But Clinton also says U.S. will continue to rebuke Israel when necessary\n   - The construction plans in East Jerusalem have strained U.S.-Israeli ties\n\n2. Option (a) simply states a fact that is already presented - that the construction plans have strained U.S.-Israeli ties. This is definitely true based on the information provided.\n\n3. Option (b) goes a step further, speculating that the ties will be negatively affected ongoing into the future by the disagreements over the construction. While this is possible, it's not a certainty based on the facts presented.\n\n4. In fact, Clinton's comments about the U.S. commitment being \"unwavering\" and the U.S. rebuking Israel \"when necessary\" suggest the relationship will endure despite disagreements. \n\n5. Therefore, while the construction plans have strained ties (option a), it's not necessarily more likely that the ties will continue to be negatively affected ongoing (option b). The relationship seems resilient enough to weather disagreements.\n\nSo in conclusion, option (a) is more probable based solely on the facts presented, while option (b) is more speculative. The conjunction of the ties being strained AND being negatively affected ongoing is less likely than the single proposition that ties have been strained.",

        "retry": false,
        "use_multi_agents": false,
        "init_model_answer": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. Statement (a) says that games like Vainglory and Asphalt 8 will take advantage of the bigger screen size on the new iPhones. This seems quite likely, as many game developers would want to leverage the larger screen real estate to enhance their games.\n\n2. Statement (b) makes the same claim as (a), but adds that these games will feature exclusive gameplay enhancements. While it's possible that some games may have exclusive features for the new iPhones, it's an additional claim that makes (b) more specific and thus less probable than (a).\n\n3. In probability theory, the probability of the conjunction of two events (A and B both occurring) is always less than or equal to the probability of either event alone. This is because for two events to occur together, each event must occur individually. So P(A and B) \u2264 P(A) and P(A and B) \u2264 P(B).\n\n4. Applying this to our question, statement (b) is the conjunction of two events: games taking advantage of screen size, AND featuring exclusive gameplay enhancements. Statement (a) is just one of these events alone.\n\n5. Therefore, even without knowing the actual probabilities, we can logically conclude that statement (a) is more likely than statement (b), as (b) cannot be more probable than (a).\n\nSo, the answer is (a): Games taking advantage of screen size will include Vainglory, Asphalt 8.",

        "init_model_answer": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We know that celebrities' graves often become public shrines that attract many fans and followers.\n\n2. Michael Jackson was a hugely popular celebrity with a massive global fanbase. It's reasonable to expect his grave would attract a lot of attention.\n\n3. The article mentions that Forest Lawn Memorial Park employees won't confirm if Jackson's body is there, likely to avoid drawing more attention to the site.\n\n4. Option (a) states that the funeral company has stringent security patrols in general. This is a broader statement that could apply regardless of whether Michael Jackson is buried there or not.\n\n5. Option (b) is more specific, stating that the stringent security is to keep fans away from Michael Jackson's grave site in particular. This is a subset of the security scenario in (a).\n\n6. Logically, the probability of a specific scenario (b) cannot be greater than the probability of a more general scenario (a) that completely encompasses it.\n\nTherefore, option (a) \"Funeral company has stringent security patrols\" is more likely than option (b). The stringent security patrols could be a general policy of the funeral company, whether or not Michael Jackson is buried there.",

Anyone who said the quote in (b) to reporters would also be included under the more general statement in (a).\n\n3) Probability theory tells us that the probability of a subset occurring (b) cannot be greater than the probability of the larger set it belongs to (a). \n\n4) Therefore, even if (b) seems more plausible or likely given the tragic context, (a) is still at least as probable, if not more probable, than (b).\n\n5) This is an example of the conjunction fallacy, where specificity and representativeness lead us to misjudge a subset as being more likely than the set it belongs to.\n\nSo in conclusion, the mathematically correct answer is (a) \"We are just all devastated,\" says her father, Mickey Harte.
