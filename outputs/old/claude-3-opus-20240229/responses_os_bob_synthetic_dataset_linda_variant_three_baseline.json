Obesity is a major risk factor for developing Type 2 Diabetes. The majority of people diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes are overweight or obese.\n\n2. Hypertension (high blood pressure) is another common comorbidity with Type 2 Diabetes, but it is not as strongly associated with the condition as obesity.\n\n3. While it is possible for a person with Type 2 Diabetes to have both obesity and hypertension, the probability of having only obesity is higher than having both conditions together.\n\nTherefore, option (a) is more likely than option (b) based on the given information.",

Individuals with severe food allergies often need to be extremely cautious about their food choices and the environments in which they eat to prevent potentially life-threatening allergic reactions.",

While hemiplegia (paralysis on one side of the body) can also occur after a stroke, not all stroke patients experience both aphasia and hemiplegia together. Aphasia alone is more likely as a single post-stroke impairment compared to the combination of aphasia and hemiplegia occurring together in the same patient.",

Overweight and obesity are well-established risk factors for developing Type 2 diabetes, as excess body fat can lead to insulin resistance.\n\nWithout additional information about the man's blood pressure, it is more reasonable to assume that he is overweight, as this is directly related to his Type 2 diabetes diagnosis.

Hypertension (high blood pressure) is a very common comorbidity with Type 2 Diabetes, regardless of weight. \n\nStudies show that around 2 in 3 adults with diabetes also have hypertension. However, the prevalence of obesity among those with Type 2 Diabetes, while higher than the general population, is estimated to be closer to 50% or even lower in some demographics.\n\nSo while obesity commonly co-occurs with Type 2 Diabetes, hypertension alone is more likely to be present than the combination of hypertension and obesity, based on the limited information provided about this individual. More context about the patient's weight, family history, and other health factors would be needed to make a more definitive determination. But with only the man's age and Type 2 Diabetes diagnosis to go on, hypertension alone is the more probable comorbidity.",

Overweight and obesity are more closely associated with the development of type 2 diabetes.\n\nKey points:\n1. Obesity is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes.\n2.
