This is a conjunction of event A (movie receives backlash and fails) AND event B (DiCaprio wins an award).\n\n5) Regardless of the specific probabilities, the probability of A and B occurring together will always be less than or equal to the probability of just A occurring.\n\n6) Therefore, based on probability theory and ignoring the narrative details, option (a) is more likely than option (b).\n\nSo the correct answer is (a) The movie receives critical backlash and fails at the box office.\n\nThis is more likely than the conjunction in (b) of the movie failing AND Leonardo DiCaprio winning an award for his performance in the failed movie.",

The two options are:\n   (a) A single event - implementing a completely free-market system\n   (b) A conjunction of two events - implementing a free-market system AND maintaining state control over key industries\n\n2) Next, let's abstract away the specific narrative details about Teng Hsiao-Ping and China's economic policies. These details can distract us from the underlying probability logic. We can reframe the problem more generically:\n   (a) Event A occurs\n   (b) Event A occurs and Event B occurs\n\n3) Now, we can apply the basic rule of probability: the probability of a conjunction, P(A and B), is always less than or equal to the probability of its individual constituents, P(A) or P(B).\n   So, P(A and B) \u2264 P(A)\n\n4) Therefore, in this abstracted form, option (a) must be more likely than option (b).
