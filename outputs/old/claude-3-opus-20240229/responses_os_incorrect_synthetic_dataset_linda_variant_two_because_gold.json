The phrase \"used to be\" implies that the U.S. was formerly the KGB's top priority enemy. Kalugin then expresses amazement at the alleged current heavy espionage by Moscow in the U.S. \n\nThis suggests that the U.S. remains a very high priority target for Russian intelligence, likely still No. 1. If it was a lower priority now, Kalugin would probably not be so surprised by the continued extensive espionage efforts against the U.S.\n\nChoice (b) tries to use Kalugin's amazement as a justification, but it doesn't logically follow. His surprise actually points more to the U.S. retaining its status as the KGB's top enemy rather than dropping in priority.
