We only know that Jordan bought new, well-fitting pants and was happy with them. There's no reason to assume the pants are specifically for work rather than general use. So the more general statement in (a) that he would continue wearing the new pants is more probable given the context provided.",

Her son, Rick, thought a nickel wasn't enough and eschewed flossing. Rick regretted this when his siblings got cash and he got gingivitis.\nWhich is more likely?\n(a) Marty would likely increase the reward to motivate Rick to floss.\n(b) Marty would likely increase the reward to motivate Rick to floss to to avoid further dental issues like gingivitis.",

        "init_model_answer": "This is a tricky one, as both options seem quite plausible. However, I believe the correct answer is (a) Marty would likely increase the reward to motivate Rick to floss.\n\nThe key consideration is that the question asks which option is more likely, not which provides the fuller explanation for why Marty would increase the reward.\n\nWhile (b) provides additional justification for increasing the reward (to avoid further dental issues), (a) more concisely captures the core causal relationship - increasing the reward to motivate the desired behavior of flossing. The dental issues in (b) are more of a secondary reason.\n\nSo while (b) is probably also true, (a) is the more likely and direct answer to the specific question being asked about Marty's primary motivation for increasing the reward. The extra details in (b) aren't necessary to answer the question.",

The main focus is on Craig's desire to gain weight and look healthy, which he achieved through a combination of weightlifting and a high-protein diet.
