Mathematically:\n   P(A and B) \u2264 P(A) and P(A and B) \u2264 P(B)\n\n4. Therefore, the probability of option (a) occurring must be greater than or equal to the probability of option (b) occurring.\n\n5. We can ignore the background information about Iraqi society and the electoral quota system, as it doesn't change the fundamental probability rule we're applying.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) - it is more likely that the candidate says she's running to challenge fundamentalist beliefs about women, without the additional condition of her belief in fighting for gender equality within the political system.",

Option (b) is a conjunction of three events:\n   - There's a moderate chance of severe weather in Oklahoma, Nebraska. \n   - A reported tornado damages 6 farms in Kansas, totally destroying 1.\n   - Strong winds cause damage in northwestern Pennsylvania.\n\n3. The conjunction rule of probability states that the probability of multiple events occurring together (a conjunction) is always less than or equal to the probability of any one of those events occurring alone.\n\n4.
