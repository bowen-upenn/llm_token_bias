Option (a) states a single event: Sam going to a shoe store.\n\n2. Option (b) is a conjunction of two events: Sam going to a shoe store AND Sam specifically looking for stylish, high-heeled shoes.\n\n3. Regardless of the background information provided about Sam's heels getting stuck and ripped off, the probability of the single event (a) is always greater than or equal to the probability of the conjunction of events (b).\n\n4. This is because for (b) to occur, both the event of Sam going to the shoe store AND the event of her specifically looking for stylish, high-heeled shoes need to happen. This is a subset of the single event of just going to the shoe store.\n\n5. Therefore, based on the laws of probability, option (a) is more likely than option (b).\n\nSo, the correct answer is (a) Sam would likely go to a shoe store. The additional detail in option (b), while seemingly relevant to the background story, actually makes it less probable than the single event described in option (a).",
