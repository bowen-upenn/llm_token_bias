Option (b) includes the same information as (a), but adds the claim that providing aid to Hamas would violate existing sanctions against the terrorist organization. \n\n4. While this additional claim in (b) could potentially be true, the question does not provide any evidence to support it. Jumping to this conclusion adds an unsupported assumption.\n\n5. In contrast, option (a) sticks to the information provided in the question and the most direct, reasonable inference from it - that Israeli officials oppose aid to Gaza because they believe it would help Hamas.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, option (a) is more likely to be true. It does not make the additional unsupported claim that (b) does.",

It does not mention anything about the IRC (International Rescue Committee, I assume) or their involvement.\n\n2. Typically, talks between North and South Korea are mediated by the two countries themselves or occasionally with the help of other nations like the United States or China. The involvement of an NGO like the IRC would be unusual in this context.\n\n3. The IRC is primarily known for its work in humanitarian crises and with refugees. While the separated families issue is a humanitarian one, it's not the typical kind of situation the IRC gets involved in.\n\n4. Option (b) adds an additional unsupported claim about the IRC's beliefs and motivations. There's no evidence given to support this.\n\n5. In general, when comparing two options, the one that makes fewer unsupported assumptions is more likely to be correct.\n\nTherefore, option (a) is more likely to be true than option (b). However, based on the information given, even option (a) seems unlikely as the IRC's involvement is not mentioned at all in the original text.\n\nThe most probable scenario based solely on the given information is that the talks will be held between North and South Korea without the IRC's involvement.
