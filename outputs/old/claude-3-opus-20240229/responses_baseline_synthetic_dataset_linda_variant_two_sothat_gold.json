Kidnappers typically make specific demands in exchange for freeing hostages.\n\nOption (a) mentions the prisoner release demand but does not explicitly link it to freeing Ebner and Kloiber. So while (a) is possible, (b) seems more likely given the context and usual motives in kidnapping situations.",
