Common symptoms of Chronic cholestasis:\n   - Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)\n   - Itching\n   - Fatigue\n   - Loss of appetite\n   - Abdominal pain\n   - Dark urine and pale stools\n\n3.

Probability:\n   - Since option (a) is a combination of two common symptoms, it is a more specific description of John's condition.\n   - Option (b) is more general, as it only mentions one symptom.\n   - In probability theory, a more specific event is less likely to occur than a more general event that includes the specific event.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (b) He experiences loss of appetite.

Loss of balance, on the other hand, is not a typical symptom directly associated with hypertension.

Excessive hunger, medically termed polyphagia, can be a symptom of various conditions such as diabetes, hyperthyroidism, or certain medications.

Common symptoms of impetigo include:\n   - Red, itchy sores that break open and leak fluid\n   - Crusted skin lesions\n   - Skin rash\n\n3. While fever can sometimes accompany impetigo, especially if the infection is widespread, it is not one of the most common or typical symptoms. High fever, in particular, would be unusual for impetigo.\n\n4. On the other hand, skin rash is a very characteristic symptom of impetigo. The red, itchy sores and rash are hallmark signs of this infection.\n\n5. Therefore, given that the patient has been diagnosed with impetigo, it is more likely that she would also experience skin rash, as this is a core symptom of the condition, rather than skin rash and high fever, as high fever is not typically associated with impetigo.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the more likely scenario is (b) She also experiences skin rash.",

Migraines are a neurological condition characterized by recurrent, intense headaches often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light and sound. They are not typically associated with gastrointestinal issues like acidity or excessive hunger.\n\n3. Acidity, or acid reflux, is a common digestive issue where stomach acid flows back into the esophagus, causing heartburn and discomfort. It is more likely to occur in older adults due to factors like decreased stomach acid production, weakened esophageal sphincter, and certain medications.\n\n4. Excessive hunger, or polyphagia, can be a symptom of various conditions such as diabetes, hyperthyroidism, or certain medications. It is not typically associated with migraines or acid reflux.\n\n5. Given that acidity is a common issue among older adults and is not directly related to migraines, it is more likely that Maria experiences acidity in addition to her migraines, rather than both acidity and excessive hunger.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and the likelihood of each condition, the answer is (b) She also experiences acidity.",
