Without more verified facts from reliable sources, I don't believe I can accurately judge which of the two scenarios is more probable.

The key reasons are:\n\n1. The passage states that witnesses reported only minor shaking on land, which suggests the earthquake epicenter was far from the land.\n\n2. Option (b) adds an unsupported assertion that \"no major damage was reported on the island.\" This additional information is not provided in the original text.\n\nIn probability judgments, we should prefer the option that makes the fewest unsupported assumptions. Option (a) sticks to the given facts, while (b) extrapolates beyond them. Therefore, based on the given information alone, (a) is more likely to be true.",

Pleading not guilty is very common for defendants in criminal trials, even when strong evidence exists. And being \"deeply upset\" could be a natural reaction to facing serious charges, but doesn't necessarily imply he is tailoring his plea to avoid self-incrimination.\n\nSo while both (a) and (b) could potentially be true, (a) is the safer assumption based solely on the details provided, while (b) makes an additional speculative leap. The more concise answer (a) is therefore more probable.",

It only states that a Red Bull wheel struck a cameraman named Paul Allen during Mark Webber's pit stop.
