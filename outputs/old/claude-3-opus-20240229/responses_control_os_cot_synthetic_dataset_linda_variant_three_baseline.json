The question is asking us to compare the likelihood of two scenarios: (a) the man being overweight, and (b) the man being overweight and having hypertension.\n\n2. According to the principles of probability, the probability of two events occurring together (a conjunction) is always less than or equal to the probability of either event occurring alone. This is because for two events to occur together, each event must occur individually.\n\n3. In this case, scenario (b) is a conjunction of two conditions: being overweight and having hypertension. For this to be true, the man must be overweight (condition 1) and also have hypertension (condition 2).\n\n4. Scenario (a), on the other hand, only requires one condition to be true: the man being overweight.\n\n5. Therefore, the probability of scenario (a) must be greater than or equal to the probability of scenario (b).\n\nSo, the correct answer is (a) He is also overweight. This is more likely than him being both overweight and suffering from hypertension.",

We are given two options to choose from: \n   (a) He carries an epinephrine auto-injector.\n   (b) He carries an epinephrine auto-injector and avoids eating at restaurants.\n\n2. Option (a) is a single event, while option (b) is a conjunction of two events - carrying an epinephrine auto-injector AND avoiding eating at restaurants.\n\n3. According to the basic probability rule, the probability of a conjunction of two events, P(A and B), is always less than or equal to the probabilities of its constituents, P(A) or P(B).\n\n4. Therefore, the probability of the man carrying an epinephrine auto-injector alone is higher than or equal to the probability of him carrying an epinephrine auto-injector and avoiding eating at restaurants.\n\n5. The additional information about the man's age and the severity of his allergy is not relevant for determining the more probable option, as we are only concerned with the probabilities of the given events.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the correct answer is (a) He carries an epinephrine auto-injector, as it is statistically more probable than option (b), which is a conjunction of two events.",

The question gives us two options:\n   (a) The man experiences Aphasia (a language disorder)\n   (b) The man experiences both Aphasia and Hemiplegia (paralysis on one side of the body)\n\n2. Probabilistically, the likelihood of a single event (Aphasia) will always be greater than or equal to the likelihood of that event occurring in conjunction with another specific event (Aphasia and Hemiplegia).\n\n3. This is because for option (b) to be true, both Aphasia AND Hemiplegia have to occur. If either one doesn't occur, (b) is not satisfied. However, for (a) to be true, we only require Aphasia to occur, regardless of whether Hemiplegia occurs or not.\n\n4. Therefore, the probability of (a) is greater than or equal to the probability of (b).\n\n5. The additional information about the man's age and the fact that he suffered a stroke is not directly relevant to the probabilistic reasoning required to answer the question.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) - it is more likely that the man experiences Aphasia, rather than the conjunction of Aphasia and Hemiplegia.",

We are given two options:\n   (a) The man suffers from insomnia.\n   (b) The man suffers from both insomnia and chronic fatigue.\n\n2. Probabilistically, the likelihood of a single event (insomnia) is always greater than or equal to the likelihood of the conjunction of that event with another event (insomnia and chronic fatigue).\n\n3. This is because for option (b) to be true, both insomnia and chronic fatigue must occur together. If either one doesn't occur, option (b) becomes false. In contrast, for option (a) to be true, only insomnia needs to occur.\n\n4. Therefore, the probability of (a) is always greater than or equal to the probability of (b).\n\nSo, the correct answer is (a) He also suffers from insomnia.
