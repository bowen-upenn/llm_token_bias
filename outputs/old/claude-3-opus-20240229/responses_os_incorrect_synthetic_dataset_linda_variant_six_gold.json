The probability of any specific sequence of 9 spins can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each individual spin. For example, for sequence (a):\n\nP(AAPPPPAAP) = (5/8) * (5/8) * (3/8) * (3/8) * (3/8) * (3/8) * (5/8) * (5/8) * (3/8) = 0.0008138\n\nIf you do the same calculation for sequences (b) and (c), you'll find the probability is exactly the same for each, because they have the same number of A's and P's, just in a different order. In general, any sequence with 6 A's and 3 P's has probability 0.0008138.\n\nSo in terms of maximizing the chances of winning, there's no reason to prefer any one of the given sequences over the others.
