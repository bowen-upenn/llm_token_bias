First, let's calculate the probability of getting a cyan (C) or white (W) on a single roll:\n   - P(C) = 5/8\n   - P(W) = 3/8\n\n2. Now, for each sequence, we can calculate the probability by multiplying the individual probabilities of each roll:\n\n   (a) WCCWWW: \n   P(WCCWWW) = P(W) * P(C) * P(C) * P(W) * P(W) * P(W)\n             = (3/8) * (5/8) * (5/8) * (3/8) * (3/8) * (3/8)\n             \u2248 0.0087\n\n   (b) WCCWW:\n   P(WCCWW) = P(W) * P(C) * P(C) * P(W) * P(W) \n            = (3/8) * (5/8) * (5/8) * (3/8) * (3/8)\n            \u2248 0.0165\n\n   (c) WCCCWW:\n   P(WCCCWW) = P(W) * P(C) * P(C) * P(C) * P(W) * P(W)\n             = (3/8) * (5/8) * (5/8) * (5/8) * (3/8) * (3/8)\n             \u2248 0.0105\n\n3. Comparing the probabilities, we see that sequence (b) WCCWW has the highest probability of occurring.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is to bet on sequence (b) WCCWW, as it has the highest probability of appearing in successive rolls of the die.",
