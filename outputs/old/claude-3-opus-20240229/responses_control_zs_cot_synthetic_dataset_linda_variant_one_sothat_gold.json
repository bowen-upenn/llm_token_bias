According to the basic rule of probability, the probability of a conjunction (two events occurring together) is always less than or equal to the probability of either of the individual events.\n\n5. Therefore, the probability of option (a) - the single event - is always greater than or equal to the probability of option (b) - the conjunction of two events.\n\n6. The background information about Sally's date with Eddie, while providing context, is not directly relevant to the probability of her seeking medical attention.\n\nBased on this probabilistic reasoning, the correct answer is (a) Sally would seek medical attention for her allergic reaction. This single event is more likely than the conjunction of her seeking medical attention and doing so for a specific reason related to her work schedule.",

The probability of this option is P(A) or P(B), where A is celebrating and B is starting another game.\n\n(b) Blake might celebrate his victory or start playing another game so that he can continue his winning streak.\nThis option also presents two events: celebrating his victory, or starting another game to continue a winning streak. However, the second event (starting another game) is conditionally dependent on the idea of a \"winning streak\". The probability of this option is P(A) or P(B|C), where A is celebrating, B is starting another game, and C is the condition of having a winning streak.\n\nFrom a probabilistic standpoint, option (a) is more likely because it presents two independent events, whereas option (b) presents a conjunction of events (winning streak and starting another game).\n\nThe additional condition of \"continuing his winning streak\" in option (b) makes it a subset of the event \"starting another game\" in option (a).
