It mentions that he enjoys coding personal projects and exploring different programming languages in his free time. Given his strong interest and skills in these areas, it is more likely that he would also enjoy participating in hackathons and coding competitions, where he can apply his knowledge, challenge himself, and collaborate with others who share similar interests.\n\nWhile it is possible that Raj is a passenger vehicle driver, as many people drive regardless of their profession or interests, the additional information about his enjoyment of hackathons and coding competitions aligns more closely with his described personality and hobbies.",

It's entirely possible for someone to have studied those fields and work in a different profession, while also having cooking as a hobby. \n\nSince (b) includes statement (a) plus additional details that are consistent with the background provided, it is more specific and therefore more probable than (a) alone. The conjunction of two statements that are both probable given the known information is more probable than just one of those statements.",

This aligns with their educational background in environmental science and marine biology.\n\nWhile it's possible that Sione could be a model maker and patternmaker, as stated in option (a), the additional information in option (b) about their participation in beach clean-up efforts is explicitly confirmed in the background information, making option (b) more probable given the context provided.",

There is no mention of him working with explosives or participating in charity marathons and fundraisers related to technology.\n\nWhile it's certainly possible for Sandeep to have additional interests and activities beyond what was described, like in option (b), the passage does not provide any evidence to suggest explosives work or charity marathons are probable for him. Option (a) makes fewer unsupported assumptions, so it is the more likely scenario given the limited information we have about Sandeep.",

Volunteering at an LGBTQ+ support center fits well with their genderqueer identity, empathetic nature, and desire to create inclusive spaces.\n\nWhile it's certainly possible Sam could be a gambling dealer as a profession, the additional detail about volunteering at the LGBTQ+ center in option (b) makes it a more likely and comprehensive description of Sam given their background and values. The gambling dealer job alone in option (a) doesn't capture as much about Sam's character and interests.",
