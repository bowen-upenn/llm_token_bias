We should avoid making unsupported assumptions.\n\nThe passage tells us Harry was running late and put on clothes straight from the dryer, and that his pants were still wet and uncomfortable during the interview.

It simply states that the men took a well-needed rest after their commander told them to break. Without additional context about the protagonist's physical condition or the intensity of their training, there is not enough evidence to support the more specific scenario described in option (b).\n\nTherefore, the more general statement in option (a), which aligns with the information given in the passage, is the more probable choice.",

The passage doesn't mention Tom having a new apartment that he needs to furnish.\n\nOption (a) sticks to the key facts presented - that Tom purchased affordable furniture on Craigslist and the transactions went smoothly. Arranging to pick up the furniture he bought is the logical next step and doesn't assume additional details. Therefore, absent more context, (a) is more likely than (b) based solely on the information provided.",
