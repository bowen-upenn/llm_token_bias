The given information tells us that Jenny's dog was hungry and she fed it leftover white rice because she was out of dog food. The dog ate and enjoyed the rice.\n\n2. Option (a) states that Jenny would buy more dog food. This is a reasonable assumption because Jenny is a responsible pet owner and would likely want to ensure her dog has proper dog food available, even though the dog enjoyed the rice.\n\n3. Option (b) states that Jenny would buy more dog food because the dog liked the rice. While the dog did enjoy the rice, this doesn't necessarily mean that Jenny would buy more dog food specifically because of this reason. The dog liking the rice is not directly related to the need to buy more dog food.\n\n4. Additionally, option (b) is a more specific statement that includes the general statement in option (a). This is similar to the Linda problem, where the more specific option is actually less likely than the more general one.\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is (a) Jenny would buy more dog food. The fact that the dog liked the rice is an additional detail that doesn't directly affect the probability of Jenny buying more dog food.",

Being tight on money, the protagonist bought the pink paper to save costs.\n\n3) The employers who received the pink paper resumes were impressed. \n\n4) Now, considering the two options:\n\n   (a) suggests that based on the positive reaction, the protagonist would be likely to buy pink paper again in the future.\n\n   (b) specifies the reason for buying pink paper again - because it was well-received by employers.\n\n5) Here's the key point: (b) is a more specific case of (a). Whenever (b) is true, (a) must also be true. But (a) could be true for other reasons besides (b).\n\n6) In probability terms, the probability of (a) must be greater than or equal to the probability of (b). This is because (b) is a subset of the possible scenarios under (a).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) The protagonist would likely buy more pink paper.
