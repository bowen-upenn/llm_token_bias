        "question": "Raj is a 28-year-old guy with a passion for computer science and mathematics. He graduated with a double major in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. Raj is known for his analytical mind, attention to detail, and love for problem-solving. In his free time, he enjoys coding personal projects, playing video games, and exploring different programming languages. Raj also has a strong interest in astronomy and often spends his evenings stargazing with his telescope. With his friendly and approachable demeanor, Raj is always willing to help his friends and classmates with challenging coding tasks.\n\nWhich is more probable?\n(a) Raj is a passenger vehicle driver.\n(b) Raj is a passenger vehicle driver and enjoys participating in hackathons and coding competitions.",

        "use_multi_agents": false,
        "init_model_answer": "Let's approach this question step by step:\n\n1. The description of Raj focuses heavily on his interests and skills in computer science, mathematics, coding, and problem-solving. This information is highly relevant to the likelihood of him participating in hackathons and coding competitions.\n\n2. Being a passenger vehicle driver is a common occupation that is not directly related to Raj's interests and skills mentioned in the description.\n\n3. The conjunction fallacy states that the probability of two events occurring together (in \"and\" statements) is always less than or equal to the probability of either one occurring alone.\n\n4. Therefore, the probability of Raj being a passenger vehicle driver and enjoying participating in hackathons and coding competitions (option b) cannot be greater than the probability of him being a passenger vehicle driver (option a).\n\n5. Even though the description of Raj might seem to fit option (b) better, the rules of probability dictate that option (a) is more likely.\n\nThus, the correct answer is (a) Raj is a passenger vehicle driver.",

        "question": "Dwayne is a 47-year-old African American man, holds degrees in both psychology and sociology, and enjoys exploring different cuisines and experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen. Which is more probable?\n(a) Dwayne is a tile and stone setter.\n(b) Dwayne is a tile and stone setter and enjoys exploring different cuisines and experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen.",
        "target_answer": "(a) Dwayne is a tile and stone setter",
        "retry": false,
        "use_multi_agents": false,
        "init_model_answer": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The description of Dwayne provides several pieces of information - his age, race, education (degrees in psychology and sociology), and a hobby (enjoying exploring cuisines and experimenting with recipes).\n\n2) Option (a) only mentions Dwayne's occupation as a tile and stone setter. Option (b) includes this occupation plus the hobby mentioned in the description.\n\n3) The additional information in option (b) might make it seem more probable. However, we need to consider the base rates - what percentage of people with psychology and sociology degrees end up as tile and stone setters? Likely a very small percentage.\n\n4) The hobby of exploring cuisines and recipes is not particularly predictive of being a tile and stone setter. Many people have hobbies unrelated to their profession.\n\n5) Given Dwayne's educational background, it's statistically more likely that he has a job more typically associated with degrees in psychology and sociology rather than being a tile and stone setter.\n\n6) Therefore, adding the hobby information to the tile and stone setter occupation doesn't make option (b) more probable than option (a). If anything, the education makes both options equally unlikely.\n\n7) When forced to choose, we should pick the option that makes the single most probable claim. That is option (a), which doesn't make the additional unlikely claim about Dwayne's hobby.\n\nSo in conclusion, the most probable option is (a) Dwayne is a tile and stone setter.",

They are passionate about conservation efforts and marine life protection. Sione enjoys participating in beach clean-up efforts to contribute to environmental preservation. \nWhich is more probable?\n(a) Sione is a model maker and patternmaker.\n(b) Sione is a model maker and patternmaker and enjoys participating in beach clean-up efforts to contribute to environmental preservation.",
        "target_answer": "(a) Sione is a model maker and patternmaker",
        "retry": false,
        "use_multi_agents": false,
        "init_model_answer": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The additional information about Sione enjoying beach clean-ups and being passionate about conservation seems highly relevant given their educational background in environmental science and marine biology. This makes answer (b) quite tempting.\n\n2. However, we need to be careful not to fall into the same conjunction fallacy trap as in the Linda problem. Saying Sione is a model maker and patternmaker AND also enjoys beach clean-ups is making their description more specific. \n\n3. A more specific description is always less probable than a more general one. There are likely many model makers and patternmakers, but only a subset of those also participate in beach clean-ups for environmental reasons.\n\n4. Sione's background makes the beach clean-up activities unsurprising and believable, but that doesn't change the fact that (b) is a subset of (a). \n\n5. Even if nearly all model makers and patternmakers with Sione's background enjoy beach clean-ups, (b) still can't be more probable than (a) by itself.\n\nTherefore, despite the compellingly relevant extra details, the most probable answer must be (a) Sione is a model maker and patternmaker.",

        "init_model_answer": "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. The description of Sandeep focuses on his personal life, interests, and profession as a computer engineer. There is no mention of him being an explosives worker.\n\n2. Being an explosives worker is a relatively rare profession compared to other occupations. Without any specific information suggesting this, it is less likely for Sandeep to have this occupation.\n\n3. The additional information in option (b) about participating in charity marathons and fundraising events, while positive, does not make it more likely for him to be an explosives worker. These activities are not directly related to his profession.\n\n4. According to the conjunction rule in probability, the probability of two events occurring together (A and B) is always less than or equal to the probability of either event occurring alone (A or B). In this case, the probability of Sandeep being an explosives worker and participating in charity events (option b) cannot be greater than the probability of him being an explosives worker (option a).\n\nTherefore, option (a) \"Sandeep is an explosives worker\" is more probable than option (b) \"Sandeep is an explosives worker and enjoys participating in charity marathons and fundraising events.\"\n\nThe correct answer is (a) Sandeep is an explosives worker.",

        "init_model_answer": "To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The description of Sam provides a lot of information about their personality, interests, and background. However, none of these details directly relate to being a gambling dealer.\n\n2. Being a gambling dealer is a specific profession that requires certain skills and training. The description of Sam does not mention any experience or interest in this field.\n\n3. On the other hand, the description of Sam's interests and activities aligns more with the second option (b). Sam's passion for social justice, community organizing, and advocating for inclusivity and diversity suggests that they would be more likely to volunteer at an LGBTQ+ support center.\n\n4. However, according to the conjunction fallacy, the probability of two events occurring together (Sam being a gambling dealer and volunteering at an LGBTQ+ support center) is always less than or equal to the probability of either event occurring alone.\n\n5.
