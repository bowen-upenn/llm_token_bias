Option (b) requires both conditions to be true - that de Gaulle would not understand modern issues AND that he would still gain a significant following. Option (a) only requires the first condition.\n\nSince option (b) has that additional specific requirement about gaining a following, which may or may not come to pass even if the first part is true, it is inherently less probable than option (a) which has fewer specific conditions.
