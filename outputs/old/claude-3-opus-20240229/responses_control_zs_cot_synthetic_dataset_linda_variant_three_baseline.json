The question presents two options:\n   (a) The man carries an epinephrine auto-injector.\n   (b) The man carries an epinephrine auto-injector AND avoids eating at restaurants.\n\n2. Option (a) involves a single event: carrying an epinephrine auto-injector. Let's call this event A.\n\n3. Option (b) involves a conjunction of two events: carrying an epinephrine auto-injector (event A) AND avoiding eating at restaurants (let's call this event B).\n\n4. According to the basic probability rule, the probability of a conjunction P(A and B) is always less than or equal to the probabilities of its constituents, P(A) or P(B).\n\n5. Therefore, the probability of the man carrying an epinephrine auto-injector AND avoiding eating at restaurants (option b) is always less than or equal to the probability of him just carrying an epinephrine auto-injector (option a).\n\n6. Ignoring the background information about the man's age and focusing solely on the probabilities, we can conclude that option (a) is more likely than option (b).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) He carries an epinephrine auto-injector.",
