However, probability theory states that the probability of two events occurring together (a conjunction) is always less than or equal to the probability of either event occurring alone.\n\nIn this case:\n- Option (a) only states that the man is overweight, which is a common risk factor for Type 2 Diabetes.\n- Option (b) states that the man is both overweight and suffers from hypertension. While both conditions are risk factors for Type 2 Diabetes, the probability of having both conditions together is less than the probability of having just one of them (being overweight).\n\nTherefore, option (a) is more likely than option (b), as it is more probable for the man to be overweight alone than to be overweight and suffer from hypertension simultaneously.",

Statement (b) includes all the information provided in (a) and adds an additional detail. \n\nIf someone has a severe peanut allergy, they are very likely to carry an epinephrine auto-injector (like an EpiPen) for emergency treatment in case of accidental exposure. This alone makes statement (a) quite probable.\n\nHowever, in addition to carrying an epinephrine auto-injector, a person with a severe peanut allergy is also likely to take precautions to avoid potential exposure, such as avoiding eating at restaurants where cross-contamination with peanuts is a risk. So statement (b), which includes both carrying an auto-injector and avoiding restaurants, is more probable given the severity of the allergy.\n\nIn summary, (b) is more likely because it's a more specific scenario that encompasses the highly probable action in (a) plus an additional likely precaution.",

However, the rules of probability dictate that the probability of two events occurring together (Aphasia AND Hemiplegia) must be less than or equal to the probability of each event occurring individually. Aphasia is a common consequence of strokes, so (a) is more probable than the conjunction of Aphasia and an additional condition, even though Hemiplegia also frequently results from strokes.",

All people who experience both frequent urination and blurred vision will, by definition, experience frequent urination. However, not all people who experience frequent urination will also experience blurred vision.\n\nMathematically, the probability of two events occurring together (in \"conjunction\") is always less than or equal to the probability of either one occurring alone.
