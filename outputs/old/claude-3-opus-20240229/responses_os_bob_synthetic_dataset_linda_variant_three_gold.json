Cramping: The affected legs may experience frequent cramping, particularly at night.\n\n2. Fatigue: The legs may feel heavy, tired, and achy, especially after prolonged standing or sitting.\n\n3. Swelling: The ankles and feet may swell due to the pooling of blood in the affected veins.\n\n4.

Common symptoms of pneumonia include cough (often with phlegm), fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. While not every patient will experience all of these symptoms, the presence of both phlegm and chills together is a more specific indication of pneumonia compared to phlegm alone.\n\nIt's important to note that Pat's age, gender identity, and racial background are not directly relevant to the likelihood of specific pneumonia symptoms. Pneumonia can affect individuals of all ages and backgrounds, and the symptoms are primarily determined by the severity and type of the infection rather than demographic factors.",

Common symptoms include diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and cramping. These symptoms often lead to dehydration due to the loss of fluids and electrolytes.\n\nSunken eyes are a common sign of dehydration. When the body loses more fluid than it takes in, it starts to pull water from various parts of the body, including the eyes, causing them to appear sunken or hollow.\n\nGiven that Morgan has been diagnosed with gastroenteritis, it is more likely that they will experience both dehydration and sunken eyes as a result of the illness, rather than just dehydration alone.",
