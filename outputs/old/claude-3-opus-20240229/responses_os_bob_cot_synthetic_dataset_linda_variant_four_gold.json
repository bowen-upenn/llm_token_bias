They have consistently released successful albums throughout their career, with many of their albums charting in multiple countries.\n\n3. Even in their later years, their albums have continued to generate significant interest and sales due to their legacy and dedicated fan base.\n\n4. World tours by The Rolling Stones have historically been highly successful, often selling out major venues due to the band's enduring popularity and live performance reputation.\n\n5. It is highly unlikely that a new album by The Rolling Stones would fail to chart in any country, given their consistent success and global appeal.\n\n6. However, it is plausible that even if an album underperformed in terms of charts, the band's world tour could still sell out major venues due to their live performance draw and dedicated fans.\n\nTherefore, option (b) is more likely: The album won't chart in any country, but their world tour sells out all the major venues. While it is improbable that the album wouldn't chart anywhere, it is comparatively more likely than the album not charting and the world tour also being unsuccessful, given The Rolling Stones' history and popularity as live performers.",

In scenario (b), the movie is not only receiving critical backlash and failing at the box office but also includes Leonardo DiCaprio winning an award for his performance. This is a more specific and restrictive scenario compared to (a).\n\n4. It is less likely for a movie to be poorly received by both critics and audiences, and still have its lead actor win an award for their performance. While not impossible, this scenario is less probable than the movie simply receiving backlash and failing commercially.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and considering Leonardo DiCaprio's reputation and success rate, option (a) is more likely: The movie receives critical backlash and fails at the box office.",

In this case, a rematch would be a strong possibility, especially given Canelo's star power and the potential revenue from a rematch.\n\n3. However, even if a rematch were to happen, Canelo winning by knockout is not a certainty. He has won by knockout in 39 of his 58 wins, which is impressive but not a guarantee.\n\n4. Moreover, the outcome of the hypothetical rematch would also depend on the specific opponent and the circumstances of the first fight's loss.\n\n5. Overall, the scenario in option (b) is more specific and involves more assumptions than option (a).\n\nGiven these considerations, I would say that option (a) is more likely: Canelo loses his next fight.

His endorsement alone could drive significant sales, even if the product itself is not of the highest quality.\n\n2. However, in today's highly connected world, poor product reviews can spread quickly online and through social media. This could potentially offset some of the positive impact of 50 Cent's celebrity status.\n\n3. The headphone market is highly competitive, with many established brands. For a new product to become a bestseller, it usually needs to offer something unique or be of very high quality, in addition to having strong marketing.\n\n4. 50 Cent's business ventures outside of music have had mixed success in the past. This suggests that his celebrity status doesn't guarantee a product's success if the product itself is subpar.\n\n5. Logically, it's more probable for a product to receive poor reviews (a single event) than for it to receive poor reviews and also become a bestseller (two events occurring together).\n\nBased on these considerations, I would say that option (a) is more likely: The headphones receive poor reviews. While 50 Cent's celebrity endorsement could boost sales to some extent, it's less likely to be enough to make a poorly reviewed product a bestseller in a competitive market.",

As a historical figure, de Gaulle is widely respected in France for his leadership during World War II and his role in shaping modern French politics. This suggests that even today, his reputation would carry significant weight.\n\n3. However, the political landscape has changed dramatically since de Gaulle's time. Many new issues have emerged, such as climate change, globalization, the rise of the European Union, and the impact of digital technologies on society.\n\n4. Given the complexity of modern politics and the emergence of new challenges, it is likely that de Gaulle would struggle to fully grasp the nuances of today's political environment.\n\n5.

However, FDR would find himself in a vastly different political and technological landscape compared to his presidency in the 1930s and 40s. He might feel unprepared to comment on modern politics without fully understanding the context and complexities of the current era.\n\n3. Despite this, FDR's resurrection alone would be a monumental event that would undoubtedly capture massive public attention. People would be extremely curious to see and hear from such a historically significant figure.\n\n4. FDR's presence, even without a speech, would likely spark increased interest in his legacy, the decisions he made as president, and how they have shaped the modern political landscape.

Despite disbanding in 2000, they have reunited a few times since, including a highly successful reunion tour in 2007-2008 and a performance at the 2012 London Olympics closing ceremony. These reunions generated significant interest and ticket sales.\n\n3. By 2025, it will have been over 20 years since their last full tour. This long hiatus could potentially increase anticipation and demand among fans who missed their earlier reunions or younger fans who never had the chance to see them live.\n\n4. However, after such a long break, there might be some initial uncertainty about the level of interest in a full reunion tour. Some fans may have moved on or lost interest over time.\n\n5. Nonetheless, given their past success and iconic status, it's likely that once the tour is announced and promoted, it will generate significant buzz and ticket sales.

Dr. David Ho is a renowned scientist who has made significant contributions to HIV/AIDS research and treatment. His expertise and experience could increase the chances of developing a successful vaccine.\n\n3. However, even with a highly skilled researcher, the initial trials of a new vaccine are more likely to face setbacks or failures than to be immediately successful. This is because initial trials are designed to identify potential problems and gather data to refine the vaccine.\n\n4. If the vaccine fails in initial trials, the researchers would typically analyze the data, identify areas for improvement, and make necessary adjustments. This iterative process is common in vaccine development.\n\n5. After further development and refinement, a vaccine that initially faced setbacks could still prove to be safe and effective, and potentially become widely used.\n\nConsidering these points, option (a) is more likely: The vaccine fails in initial trials. While option (b) is a possibility, it is less likely than the vaccine facing initial setbacks, as most vaccines require multiple rounds of refinement before becoming successful.",

For an album to not chart in the first week, it would have to have surprisingly low sales and streams. Given Elton John's popularity, this seems unlikely, though not impossible if the album release was very low-key or it differed drastically from his usual style.\n\n3. Option (b) requires not only the album to not chart initially (which is already unlikely), but then also to suddenly become a top-ten hit later due to a viral social media campaign.

Becoming the leading news channel within the first year is an extremely ambitious and unlikely goal for a brand new network, even with Ted Turner's resources and experience.\n\n(2) News viewership is influenced by many factors including the reputation of the network and its anchors, marketing reach, public interest in current events, and competition from established networks. Building loyalty and trust with viewers usually takes time. It's highly improbable that a new network could overtake dominant players like CNN, Fox News, MSNBC etc. in short order.\n\n(3) Even if the new network did manage the unlikely feat of becoming #1 in its first year through an extraordinary alignment of factors, maintaining that position would be immensely challenging. The initial novelty and buzz would likely fade, and competitors would adjust their strategies to win back viewers.

The public interest and media attention around a reigning or former monarch revealing intimate details and political views for the first time would be immense.\n\n4.

Even if Elon did decide to fly with another aerospace company for some reason, he would still be more likely to use SpaceX technology for building a habitat on Mars. SpaceX is at the forefront of developing the necessary technology for Mars habitation.\n\n4. Using another company's technology for the habitat would be less probable, as it would mean relying on external technology that may not align with SpaceX's designs and mission architecture for Mars colonization.\n\nTherefore, option (b) is more likely: Even if Elon chooses to fly with another aerospace company, he would still probably use SpaceX technology to build a habitat on Mars.",

Under his leadership, West Germany experienced a period of significant economic growth and prosperity, known as the \"Wirtschaftswunder\" or \"economic miracle.\"\n\n3. Adenauer worked to rebuild West Germany's international relationships, particularly with France and the United States. He was instrumental in the formation of the European Coal and Steel Community, a precursor to the European Union.\n\n4. He also prioritized Germany's reintegration into the international community and sought to establish the country as a stable democracy.\n\nGiven these historical facts, it is less likely that Adenauer would have failed to improve Germany's international relations. His efforts to rebuild relationships with other nations and promote European integration were a significant part of his political agenda.\n\nOn the other hand, while Adenauer's economic policies did contribute to the \"Wirtschaftswunder,\" the idea that he could have successfully revived the domestic economy without improving international relations is less plausible. The economic recovery was closely tied to Germany's reintegration into the global economy and the establishment of strong international partnerships.\n\nTherefore, option (a) is more likely: \"He fails to improve Germany's international relations.\" However, this scenario is still unlikely given Adenauer's actual historical record.",

He played a major role in the Second Industrial Revolution and helped negotiate Germany's reparations after World War I through the Young Plan.\n\n2. Posthumous Nobel Peace Prizes are very rare. In fact, the Nobel Prize rules state that a prize cannot be awarded posthumously unless death has occurred after the announcement of the Nobel Prize winners. The only posthumous Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld in 1961.\n\n3. Given Young's significant contributions to diplomacy and international relations, it's plausible that he could be nominated for a posthumous Nobel Peace Prize, despite the rarity of such an occurrence.\n\n4. However, actually winning the prize posthumously is extremely unlikely given the Nobel Prize rules, which have only been waived once in the case of the Peace Prize.\n\n5.

His fan base and the general public's interest would almost certainly lead to enough sales and streams for the album to chart.\n\n4. While it is possible for an album to not chart well initially but gain popularity and sales over time, this is less likely for an established artist like Jay-Z, who has a large and dedicated fan base.\n\n5. Achieving platinum certification (1 million units sold in the U.S.) is a significant milestone, but it often requires strong initial sales and sustained interest over time.\n\nGiven these considerations, option (a) \"The album does not chart on its first week\" is more likely than option (b) \"The album does not chart on its first week but eventually goes platinum.\" It is highly unlikely that a new Jay-Z album would not chart at all in its first week, and even less probable that it would fail to chart initially but still manage to reach platinum status later.\n\nTherefore, the more likely scenario is (a) The album does not chart on its first week.",

        "init_model_answer": "Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:\n\n1. George W. Bush is a former U.S. President, not a professional artist. It's highly unlikely for someone to suddenly become a celebrated contemporary artist without a strong background and history in the art world, regardless of their fame in other areas.\n\n2. If Bush were to gain recognition as an artist, it's more plausible that the attention would stem primarily from his status as a former president rather than the inherent artistic merit or innovation of his work. The novelty factor of a former world leader turning to art would be a major talking point.\n\n3. The contemporary art scene is known for valuing innovation, boundary-pushing, and conceptual depth. It's less probable that a newcomer, especially one known for a completely different career, would be able to make such a splash solely on the basis of their artwork's quality and originality.\n\n4. There are certainly cases of celebrities or public figures gaining acclaim for their artwork, but this is often seen as a side note to their main claim to fame, and their art is often judged in that context rather than purely on its own merits.\n\nTherefore, if George W. Bush were to start painting landscapes and gain any recognition in the art world, option (b) is much more likely: He will become the next celebrated artist in the contemporary art scene, but his paintings will be more appreciated for their novelty coming from a former president rather than their artistic innovation.",

Option (a) states that American historians rank him poorly overall. However, this seems to contradict the given information about Truman being the most influential post-war president.

It acknowledges that while historians may rank Truman poorly overall, they still recognize the critical decisions he made during his presidency that led to significant positive outcomes. This aligns better with the idea of Truman being considered the most influential post-war president.\n\n4. Influential leaders often make difficult decisions that may not be popular at the time but can lead to positive long-term consequences. Option (b) captures this idea by suggesting that despite a potentially poor overall ranking, historians acknowledge Truman's crucial decisions and their positive impact.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the reasoning above, option (b) is more likely: American historians rank Harry Truman poorly overall but acknowledge his critical decisions during his presidency led to significant positive outcomes.",

Pope John Paul II was known for many things during his papacy, including his work in improving interfaith relations and his role in the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe.\n\n3. When a pope is canonized, it is typically for their overall life and impact, not just one specific aspect of their papacy. The Catholic Church usually tries to highlight the various ways in which the person demonstrated holiness and positive impact.\n\n4. Therefore, if Pope John Paul II were to be canonized, it is unlikely that the Church would ignore his work in interfaith relations, as this was a significant part of his legacy.\n\n5. However, his role in the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe was also a major historical event and a significant part of his legacy.\n\nGiven these points, option (b) seems more likely than option (a).

Johnson's political style: LBJ was known for his \"Johnson Treatment,\" an assertive, persuasive, and sometimes aggressive negotiation style. This might not be as effective or well-received in today's political climate, where voters often prefer a more relaxed and relatable approach.\n\n3. Democratic Party: The Democratic Party has also changed since Johnson's time. It has become more progressive on social issues and more diverse in its representation. Johnson's record on civil rights, while groundbreaking for his time, might not be progressive enough for many of today's Democratic primary voters.\n\n4. Media attention: As a former president, Johnson would likely attract significant media attention if he were to run for office again.

This would allow her to leverage her existing reputation and skills.\n\n4. Moreover, the specificity of option (b) - winning an Oscar for playing a judge - makes it inherently less likely than the more general option (a) of winning an Oscar for any role.\n\n5. The conjunction fallacy comes into play here: option (b) is a more specific instance of option (a). Probability theory dictates that the probability of two events occurring together (winning an Oscar AND for playing a judge) is always less than or equal to the probability of either event occurring alone.\n\nTherefore, option (a) \"She wins an Academy Award for Best Actress\" is more likely than option (b) \"She wins an Academy Award for Best Actress but it's for a role where she plays a judge.\"",

Option (a) suggests that the show will receive low listener ratings, which is a possibility considering that his style may not appeal to a broad mainstream audience.\n\n4.

The principle of Occam's Razor suggests that when faced with competing hypotheses, we should favor the one that makes the fewest assumptions.

As the leader of the Catholic Church, he has a large following around the world. This suggests that a book about his life would generate significant interest.\n\n2) Books by or about major public figures, especially those with a large following, often become bestsellers quickly due to the built-in audience. This supports the likelihood of option (a).\n\n3) However, the Pope is known for his relatively progressive views on some issues compared to previous Popes. This has sometimes led to controversy within the Church. \n\n4) Despite this, it seems unlikely that the Pope would include highly controversial opinions in a book about his own life. As the leader of the Church, he would likely be cautious about creating major controversy.\n\n5) Even if the book did contain some controversial views, the Pope's status and the interest in his life story would still likely drive strong sales, at least in the short term.\n\nTherefore, while both scenarios are plausible, option (a) seems more likely: The book becomes a bestseller in the first week of release, without the added condition of containing several controversial opinions.\n\nSo the answer is (a) The book becomes a bestseller in the first week of release.",

Party affiliation:\n   - Harry Truman was a Democratic president in the mid-20th century.\n   - The Democratic Party has evolved since Truman's time, with shifts in policy positions and priorities.\n   - It's possible that Truman might find some of his views more aligned with the modern Republican Party, especially on issues like foreign policy and national security.\n\n2. Social welfare policies:\n   - During his presidency, Truman supported various social welfare policies, such as the Fair Deal, which included measures like expanding Social Security, increasing the minimum wage, and providing housing assistance.\n   - These types of policies are more commonly associated with the modern Democratic Party.\n   - If Truman were to run for office today, it's likely that he would still advocate for social welfare policies, given his historical record.\n\n3. Combining the two factors:\n   - While Truman might consider changing his party affiliation due to shifts in party platforms, it's less likely that he would completely abandon his commitment to social welfare policies.\n   - Changing party affiliation while still focusing on social welfare policies would require a more nuanced approach, balancing his views with the current political landscape.\n\nBased on this analysis, I believe that option (a) is more likely: If Harry Truman were to run for office today, he might change his party affiliation, but it is less likely that he would do so while still maintaining a strong focus on social welfare policies, as stated in option (b).",

While it's possible for any book, even by a famous author, to receive some negative reviews, the likelihood of a J.K. Rowling book receiving predominately harsh criticism seems relatively low considering her writing skill and past successes.\n\n3.

Therefore, while both scenarios are possible, option (b) - the book receives harsh initial criticism but still becomes a bestseller within a year - seems more likely given J.K.

        "init_model_answer": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) Borman and Lovell are real-life astronauts from NASA's early space missions, including the first mission to orbit the moon (Apollo 8). They are not professional actors.\n\n2) Movies starring non-professional actors, especially those not based on their real lives, rarely win major film awards. The lack of acting experience usually shows compared to professional actors.\n\n3) However, the space adventure theme and having real astronauts could generate significant public interest and draw audiences based on the novelty factor and the astronauts' real-life experiences.\n\n4) Many successful blockbuster movies, especially in the action and adventure genres, have been box office hits without winning major awards.\n\n5) Therefore, while it's quite likely this hypothetical movie wouldn't win awards with the astronauts' limited acting experience (both options agree on this), there's a reasonable chance it could still become a box office hit based on the novelty and public interest.\n\nSo in conclusion, option (b) is more likely: the movie winning no awards but still becoming a box office hit seems more probable than just winning no awards, given the factors involved.",

        "question": "Suppose George Catlett Marshall were to come back to modern times to work on international policy again. Which is more likely:  \n(a) He struggles to understand contemporary geopolitics.  \n(b) He struggles to understand contemporary geopolitics but eventually brokers a groundbreaking international agreement.",
        "target_answer": "(a) He struggles to understand contemporary geopolitics",
        "retry": false,
        "use_multi_agents": false,
        "init_model_answer": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. Firstly, George C. Marshall was a brilliant strategist and diplomat, known for his leadership, intelligence, and ability to navigate complex political situations. This suggests he had strong analytical and adaptability skills.\n\n2. However, the world has changed dramatically since Marshall's time in the mid-20th century. Geopolitics today involves many new countries, altered alliances, different key players, and new pressing issues like terrorism and climate change that didn't exist in the same way during his era.\n\n3. Given the major shifts in geopolitics, it's highly likely that Marshall would initially struggle to fully grasp all the nuances and changes in the contemporary landscape. He would need time to study and come up to speed on decades of history and current events that he missed.\n\n4. That said, given his proven skills, it's plausible that after an adjustment period of learning and analysis, Marshall could eventually get a strong handle on the new geopolitical realities. His intellect and diplomatic abilities wouldn't just disappear.\n\n5. However, to then go on to broker a \"groundbreaking international agreement\" would be a very high bar, even for someone of Marshall's caliber. Such major diplomatic feats are rare and would require navigating all the complexities of the modern world order.\n\nSo in conclusion, while I believe Marshall could eventually get up to speed on contemporary geopolitics after struggling initially, the idea that he would then achieve a landmark diplomatic agreement seems like more of a stretch without more information.\n\nTherefore, I believe (a) is the more likely scenario: He struggles to understand contemporary geopolitics.",

        "target_answer": "(a) Kamala Harris will lose in the primary elections",
        "retry": false,
        "use_multi_agents": false,
        "init_model_answer": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. Kamala Harris is the current Vice President, which gives her high name recognition and a strong political platform if she were to run for president in 2024. This could give her an advantage in the primary elections.\n\n2. However, there will likely be a competitive field of Democratic candidates vying for the nomination, which could make it challenging for Harris to secure the top spot on the ticket. Incumbent vice presidents don't always succeed in winning their party's presidential nomination.\n\n3. If Harris were to lose in the primary elections, it's unlikely she would be chosen as the vice-presidential candidate again. Typically, the presidential nominee selects a new running mate to balance the ticket and bring in additional support.\n\n4. It's rare for a vice president to run for the nomination, lose, and then be selected as the VP candidate again by the winning nominee. This hasn't happened in modern U.S. political history.\n\n5. Therefore, if Harris runs in the 2024 primaries and loses, it's more likely that she would not be on the Democratic ticket at all, rather than being chosen as the vice-presidential candidate for a second time.\n\nBased on this analysis, option (a) is more likely: If Kamala Harris runs in the 2024 Democratic primary elections, it is more likely that she would lose in the primaries and not be on the ticket, rather than losing the nomination but still being selected as the vice-presidential candidate again.",

        "init_model_answer": "Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1. Nikita Khrushchev was the leader of the Soviet Union during the Cold War era, a period of heightened tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union.\n\n2. Given the political climate of the time, it is unlikely that Khrushchev, as the leader of the Soviet Union, would receive a standing ovation from all present at the United Nations, as many nations aligned with the United States would likely be hesitant to show such strong support.\n\n3. The incident of Khrushchev banging his shoe on the table at the United Nations did occur in reality during a UN General Assembly meeting in 1960. However, this was an unusual and dramatic event that is not typical of diplomatic protocol.\n\n4. The action of banging his shoe on the table would likely be seen as a highly controversial and inflammatory gesture, especially in the formal setting of the United Nations, and would probably overshadow any potential standing ovation.\n\n5. Therefore, while both scenarios are unlikely, it is comparatively more plausible that Khrushchev would receive a standing ovation (though not from all present) than it is for him to receive a unanimous standing ovation and then proceed to bang his shoe on the table.\n\nIn conclusion, option (a) \"He will receive a standing ovation from all present\" is more likely than option (b) \"He will receive a standing ovation from all present but then dramatically remove his shoe and bang it on the table.\"",

This is a more plausible scenario, as a controversial book by a figure like Khomeini would likely attract attention and criticism from Western academics and experts in political philosophy, Middle Eastern studies, and related fields.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the historical and political context, option (b) is more likely: The book becomes a bestseller in the USA but is heavily criticized by Western scholars.

        "init_model_answer": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. Teng Hsiao-ping (also known as Deng Xiaoping) was a prominent Chinese leader who served as the paramount leader of the People's Republic of China from 1978 until his retirement in 1992. He passed away in 1997.\n\n2. During his leadership, Deng introduced significant economic reforms, moving China towards a more market-oriented economy. This included opening up the country to foreign investment, allowing private businesses to operate, and implementing the \"household responsibility system\" in agriculture.\n\n3. However, despite these reforms, the Chinese Communist Party maintained a strong grip on political power and continued to exert significant control over key industries and the overall direction of the economy. This system is often referred to as \"socialism with Chinese characteristics\" or \"socialist market economy.\"\n\n4. Given Deng's historical approach and the fact that he is no longer alive in 2023, it is highly unlikely that he would implement a completely free-market system, as mentioned in option (a).\n\n5. Option (b) aligns more closely with Deng's actual policies during his leadership, which involved economic liberalization while maintaining state control over key sectors.\n\nTherefore, if Teng Hsiao-Ping were hypothetically advising on China's economic policies in 2023, option (b) is more likely: He would implement a more market-oriented system but maintain strong state control over key industries, consistent with his approach during his leadership.",

        "init_model_answer": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. John J. Sirica was the chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia during the Watergate scandal in the 1970s. He played a crucial role in the legal proceedings that ultimately led to President Richard Nixon's resignation.\n\n2. Throughout the Watergate trials, Sirica was known for his tough stance and his commitment to uncovering the truth. He made several controversial decisions, such as ordering President Nixon to turn over the White House tapes, which proved to be pivotal evidence in the case.\n\n3. Despite facing immense political pressure, Sirica remained committed to his legal principles and the integrity of the judicial process. His actions during the Watergate trials were widely seen as upholding the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary.\n\n4. Given Sirica's track record and his demonstrated commitment to legal principles during a highly charged political trial, it seems more likely that if he were to become a central figure in another major political trial, he would once again prioritize the integrity of the legal process, even if it meant making difficult or controversial decisions.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and Sirica's historical actions, I believe that option (b) is more likely: If John J. Sirica becomes a central figure in another major political trial, he is more likely to compromise his legal principles but ultimately uphold the integrity of the legal process.",
