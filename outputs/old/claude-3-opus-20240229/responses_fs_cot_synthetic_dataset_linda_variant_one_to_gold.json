The specific reason for doing so (avoiding further dental issues) is not essential to make this decision.",

According to the principle of Occam's razor, when faced with competing hypotheses that make the same predictions, one should select the solution with the fewest assumptions. In this case, option (a) makes fewer assumptions and is more general.\n\n5.

However, not everyone is active on social media or feels the need to share every life event online.

The desire to get autographs or photos is more universal, while sharing them online is more variable based on individual preferences.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is (a) Tom would likely ask the band members for autographs or take photos with them.",

This shows she had high hopes and expectations from this service.\n\n2) However, the matchmaker took the money but did not deliver on the promise - the handsome man never showed up. This is a clear case of an unfulfilled service that Cecelia paid for.\n\n3) Given Cecelia's belief in the matchmaker's abilities and the fact that she paid a significant sum, it's very likely that she would confront the matchmaker about not fulfilling the service she was paid for.\n\n4) Now, between the two options:\n   (a) Confronting the matchmaker about the unfulfilled service\n   (b) Confronting the matchmaker about the unfulfilled service to demand a refund\n   \n   While both involve confronting the matchmaker, option (b) is more specific. It mentions confronting the matchmaker with the purpose of demanding a refund.\n\n5) Since Cecelia paid handsomely for a service she didn't receive, it's more probable that she would not only confront the matchmaker but also demand her money back.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (b) Cecelia would likely confront the matchmaker about the unfulfilled service to demand a refund.",

Option (a) is a more general statement, while option (b) is more specific by providing the reason why Joe would protect his sheep.\n\n3. The correct answer in such probability comparisons is typically the more general statement, as it encompasses the more specific one. Any situation where Joe protects his sheep to prevent them from getting hurt (option b) is also a situation where he protects his sheep (option a), but not vice versa.\n\n4. Adding extra details to a statement, as in option (b), makes it more specific and thus less likely to occur compared to the more general statement in option (a).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) Joe would protect his sheep from the wolves.",

The passage states that the garden was \"blooming healthily in no time at all.\" For a garden to thrive, it typically requires regular watering and tending.\n\n3. Both options (a) and (b) state that Kendall would regularly water and tend to her garden, which aligns with the context provided.\n\n4.

While this is a possible motivation, the passage does not provide any information to support this specific reasoning.\n\n5. According to the principle of Occam's razor, when faced with competing hypotheses that make the same predictions, one should select the solution with the fewest assumptions.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and the principle of making the fewest unsubstantiated assumptions, the most likely answer is (a) Kendall would regularly water and tend to her garden.",

As a presidential candidate, the protagonist would likely want to maintain their composure and not let the unexpected event derail the speech entirely.\n\n4. Acknowledging the bird's presence shows that the candidate is aware of the situation and is not flustered by it.\n\n5. Making light of the situation by incorporating the bird's presence into the speech in a humorous way could help the candidate:\n   a. Regain the audience's attention\n   b.

It's common for people to share these stories when asked about their scars.\n\n3. Option (a) simply states that Tom would likely tell the story of how he got his scar.

This option is more general and encompasses a wider range of potential cleaning situations.\n\nStep 2: Consider option (b)\nOption (b) is more specific, as it narrows down the recommendation or rehiring to only grape juice stain removal. While the cleaners did a good job removing the grape juice stain, it's unlikely that Jodie would limit her recommendation or future hiring to just this specific situation.\n\nStep 3: Compare the likelihood of options (a) and (b)\nOption (a) is more probable because it covers a broader range of cleaning situations for which Jodie might recommend or rehire the cleaners. Option (b) is less likely because it's overly specific and doesn't account for the possibility that Jodie might need the cleaners for other tasks in the future.\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is (a) Jodie might recommend the cleaners to others or rehire them in the future.",
