Shorter sequences are, all else being equal, more likely to appear than longer ones because there are fewer spins that need to match the desired outcome exactly.\n\n2. **Content of Sequences**: We also have to account for the distribution of H and E in each sequence.

Intuitively, the probability of a specific shorter sequence appearing is generally higher than that of a longer one because fewer spins must fall perfectly in place.\n\nThus, comparing the likelihoods and sequence lengths, **Option (a) HEEHH** emerges as the most likely sequence to occur because it is the shortest and efficiently incorporates the more probable outcome (H over E).",

Here, the sequence includes two yellow (Y) and two lavender (L). Given that yellows are fewer on the spinner, having two in a shorter sequence is more likely than having three yellows as in sequence (a), but it's still not the most probable due to the number of yellows required.\n\n(c) **LYLLY**: This sequence consists of 5 spins, with two yellow (Y) and three lavender (L).
