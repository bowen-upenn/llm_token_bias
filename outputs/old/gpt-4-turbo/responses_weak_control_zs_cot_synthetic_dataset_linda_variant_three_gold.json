        "init_model_answer": "The correct answer is:\n(b) He also experiences a headache.\n\nExplanation:\nIn the scenario given, option (b) is more likely than option (a) because experiencing a headache is a primary symptom of migraine. Option (a), which includes both a headache and a stiff neck, would require both symptoms to manifest simultaneously, making it a conjunction of two conditions and statistically less likely than just experiencing a headache alone. According to probability rules, the likelihood of a conjunction (two events together) cannot be greater than the likelihood of a single constituent event.",

To decide between the two options:\n\nOption (a) suggests that John experiences not only depression but also acidity along with his migraines.\nOption (b) suggests that John experiences depression along with his migraines.\n\nAccording to the principles of probability, the likelihood of multiple, specific events occurring in conjunction (option a) is generally less than or equal to the likelihood of a single specific event occurring (option b). Adding more specific conditions generally reduces the probability of that combined event happening. This is because each added condition must be met in addition to the other(s).\n\nThus, it is statistically more likely that:\n(b) John also experiences depression.\n\nOption (b) is more likely than option (a) because it involves fewer combined specific conditions needing to occur simultaneously.",

Since dehydration is a common symptom of gastroenteritis, this single event is more probable than the conjunction of both dehydration and sunken eyes happening simultaneously.
