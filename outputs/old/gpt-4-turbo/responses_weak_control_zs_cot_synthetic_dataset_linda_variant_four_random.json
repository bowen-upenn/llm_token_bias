Here, the second condition (selling out the world tour) is added to the first condition.\n\nAccording to probability theory and the concept of the conjunction fallacy, a conjunction (an \"and\" statement that combines multiple conditions) cannot be more probable than any of its constituent single conditions. This principle holds because the conjunction adds additional requirements that must be satisfied for the overall statement to be true. Hence, option (b), which includes all the conditions of option (a) plus an additional condition, must be less likely than option (a) alone.\n\nTherefore, the more probable option between these two is:\n(a) The album won't chart in any country.",
