Understanding arthritis: Arthritis primarily affects the joints, often causing symptoms like pain, swelling, and reduced range of movement. Muscle weakness can be a secondary effect due to reduced mobility or inflammation affecting the muscles. Movement stiffness is also a common symptom with arthritis due to joint issues.\n\n3. Logical reasoning based on probability: The probability of experiencing only one of the symptoms (muscle weakness) against experiencing both symptoms (muscle weakness and movement stiffness) needs to be evaluated. Generally, experiencing any one symptom (muscle weakness alone) is statistically more likely than experiencing a specific combination of symptoms (both muscle weakness and movement stiffness).\n\nSo the answer is:\n(b) She also experiences muscle weakness.",

This is because the combination (skin rash and malaise) cannot happen without the presence of the skin rash, but the skin rash can occur without malaise.\n\nTherefore, option (b) focusing solely on the skin rash is statistically more likely than (a), which combines skin rash with malaise.",

It is important to note that not all genderqueer individuals may experience menstruation, depending on their biological attributes and any medical treatments they might be undergoing to align their physical appearance with their gender identity.\n\n3. **Symptom relevance**: While fatigue is a common symptom of hypothyroidism, abnormal menstruation is also a possible symptom but may not be relevant depending on Taylor's anatomical characteristics. Therefore, the inclusion of abnormal menstruation in option (a) might not apply to Taylor.\n\n4. **Application of the Conjunction Rule**: This rule in probability states that the likelihood of two events occurring together (in \"conjunction\") is always less than or equal to the likelihood of either event occurring alone. \n\nGiven these considerations, the more probable option is solely that Taylor experiences fatigue, without specifying additional symptoms.
