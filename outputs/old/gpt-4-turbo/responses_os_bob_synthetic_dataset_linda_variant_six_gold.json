This sequence entails spinning four indigo segments followed by two fuchsia segments.\n(b) IIIIIFF. This sequence entails spinning five indigo segments followed by two fuchsia segments.\n(c) FIIIIFF. This sequence involves spinning one fuchsia segment, four indigo segments, followed by two fuchsia segments.\n\nThe probabilities of the sequences can generally be estimated by multiplying the probabilities of each individual spin outcome in the sequence. For longer sequences of the same color and especially those involving a color with lesser likelihood (indigo, in this case, has a lower probability than fuchsia), the overall sequence probability decreases.\n\nSince sequence (a) IIIIFF is shorter and contains one less indigo segment compared to sequence (b) IIIIIFF, it has a higher probability of occurring. Sequence (c) FIIIIFF begins with a fuchsia segment which is more likely than an indigo segment, but it still follows with four indigo segments, which makes it less likely than a shorter indigo sequence.\n\nTherefore, sequence (a) IIIIFF is statistically the best choice because it is shorter and contains fewer consecutive segments of the less likely color, indigo.
