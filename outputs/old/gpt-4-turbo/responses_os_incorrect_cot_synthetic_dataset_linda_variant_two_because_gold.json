Therefore:\n\n- Statement (a) concerns only one claim: that Arturo Gallegos was responsible for 80% of the killings.\n- Statement (b) includes the same claim as in (a) and adds an additional claim: that he did so because he is a dangerous criminal known for his violent nature.\n\nSince adding more specifics in statement (b) introduces more conditions for its truth, the probability of both conditions in statement (b) being true combined cannot be higher than the probability of the single condition in statement (a). Therefore, statement (a) is more likely. Hence, the correct answer is:\n\n**(a) Police say he was behind 80 percent of the killings there over the past 16 months.**",

This is a plausible scenario, with Giggs transitioning into a coaching role under the new management, which could occur for any number of reasons.\n\nOption (b) also states that Ryan Giggs is appointed as assistant and that he ends his playing career, but specifically because of his desire to focus exclusively on coaching. This adds a specific reason for Giggs ending his playing career.\n\nLooking at the principle of conjunction in probability, which states that the probability of two events happening together (in 'and' condition) is less than or equal to the probability of either one occurring alone. Hence, option (a) is simply \"Ryan Giggs is appointed as assistant, and ends playing career,\" and option (b) adds an additional condition that Giggs ends his playing career specifically \"to focus exclusively on coaching.\"\n\nSo, following the rule of conjunction:\n\nThe correct answer is:\n(a) He appoints Ryan Giggs as assistant, and Welshman ends playing career. \n\nOption (a) has a higher likelihood of being true as it contains fewer conditions than option (b), thus making it more generally probable without the additional specific reasoning regarding his focus on coaching alone.",

There is a mention of a scheme involving impounding cars of people unable to pay release fees, and later these cars being sold or kept by police officers.\n2. The involvement in this scheme includes high-ranking officials, such as the former and interim chiefs.\n3. No specific details are provided about the financial implications for those whose cars were impounded beyond the difficulty in paying release fees.\n\nAnalyzing these points, the likelihood of the police department being strained could revolve around the corruption scandal potentially leading to a disruption in its operations, additional scrutiny from media and authorities, or administrative challenges due to the arrest of key members.\n\nTherefore, in response to the choices:\n\n- Option (a) CNN affiliate says small department is strained by the number of arrests reflects a general strain on the department due to the arrests linked to corruption, irrespective of the specific issue of impound fees.\n- Option (b) CNN affiliate says small department is strained by the number of arrests because individuals are finding it difficult to pay the release fees for their impounded cars introduces a specific reason related to financial difficulty in paying fees, which although plausible, lacks direct connection with the reason the department is strained mentioned in the original information.\n\nThe more likely scenario based on the information provided directly would be:\n**(a) CNN affiliate says small department is strained by the number of arrests**. This focuses on the strain from the arrests themselves and does not assume additional specific reasons that are not explicitly stated in the information given.",

Given the high-profile nature of the Bin Laden raid, it is certainly probable that the operation was heavily reliant on a team effort rather than any single individual's actions. Given this, both statements emphasize the team effort. \n\nThe key difference between the two statements is the added explanation in option (b) that explicitly ties the team effort to the fact that the operation \"involved multiple members of the SEAL Team 6.\" This offers a reason for why the action was a team effort, aligning it more closely with the operational norms of SEAL Team missions. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n(b) Bergen: Killing was team effort, may not have been connected to bin Laden gun in the room because the operation involved multiple members of the SEAL Team 6.",
