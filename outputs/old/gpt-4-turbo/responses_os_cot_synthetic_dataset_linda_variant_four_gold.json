Each additional condition makes the likelihood lower compared to only one condition.\n\nOption (a) requires only one condition to be met: the movie receives an Oscar nomination. This is a broader criterion than option (b).\n\nStep 2: Applying probability law - In probability theory, the probability of event A (Oscar nomination) and event B (making over $500 million) both occurring cannot be greater than the probability of either event occurring alone. Therefore, the probability of (b) (both an Oscar nomination and making over $500 million) must be less than or equal to the probability of (a) (just an Oscar nomination).\n\nBased on these principles, the answer is:\n(a) The movie receives an Oscar nomination.",

This seems inconsistent with his historical views and philosophical on industrialization without any qualifiers.\n   - **Option (b)** suggests that Gandhi would support modern industrial policies but with an emphasis on traditional values and non-violent resistance. This is more aligned with his known beliefs as it integrates his support for development with his essential principles of traditionalism and non-violence.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Gandhi's historical stance makes it more plausible that even if he found reason to support modern industrial policies, he would unequivocally advocate for these to be tempered with traditional values and non-violent principles.\n\nHence, the answer is:\n(b) He speaks in favor of modern industrial policies but emphasizes traditional values and non-violent resistance.",

Given Marshall's historical context and the significant differences in today's geopolitical landscape compared to the mid-20th century, it is quite plausible he would initially find it challenging to understand modern geopolitics.\n\nThe second statement (b) adds to the first - not only does it suggest he struggles, but it also posits that despite these struggles, he eventually brokers a groundbreaking international agreement. This part introduces an additional element which, while not impossible, adds a layer of complexity and decreases the overall probability when compared to just struggling. The likelihood of achieving such a specific and significant outcome (a groundbreaking international agreement) depends on many uncontrollable and unpredictable factors.\n\nConsidering probability alone, the occurrence of only the first part (struggling with contemporary geopolitics) is more straightforward and thus more likely than the occurrence of both struggling and successfully brokering a significant agreement.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n(a) He struggles to understand contemporary geopolitics.",
