It suggests an awkward and improbable reason for casting based on a personal hobby, which is generally irrelevant in professional casting decisions.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n(a) Demi's Lovelace role is rumoured to be filled by Chlo\u00eb Sevigny",

Its actions typically aim to obstruct whaling activities directly.\n\n2. **Assessing the Actions Described**: The incident involving grappling hooks and bamboo poles suggests a confrontational and direct engagement typically consistent with Sea Shepherd's known tactics against whaling activities.\n\n3. **Evaluating Options**:\n    - Option (a) suggests that Sea Shepherd's vessel, Steve Irwin, is attempting to disrupt Japanese whaling ships. This aligns with Sea Shepherd's established mission and known tactics, which are direct interventions aimed at stopping or obstructing whaling activities.\n    - Option (b) adds the motive of increasing media coverage to the actions of disruption. While it is true that media attention can be a side effect or even a strategic aim of such actions to spread awareness and support for the cause, the primary objective based on historical patterns of behavior would be the direct disruption of whaling activities.\n\n4. **Analyzing the Primary Motive**:\n    - Given the prior knowledge and typical patterns of Sea Shepherd, their primary motive is more likely focused on the direct action of disrupting whaling activities rather than the pursuit of media coverage. Media coverage is often a secondary benefit that helps in advocacy and raising awareness but is not typically the primary reason for an operation.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, **option (a)** Sea Shepherd's vessel Steve Irwin is attempting to disrupt Japanese whaling ships, stands as the more likely scenario given the context and nature of Sea Shepherd\u2019s known objectives and actions. Option (b) could be a secondary consideration but is not the primary motive as per the typical operations of the organization.",

There's a logical link here suggesting that during economic downturns, people may be more cautious about having children due to financial constraints.\n\nOption (b) \"Part of the decline can be attributed to the recession, expert says to an unrelated hiking magazine interview\" introduces an unusual context (a hiking magazine) for a discussion about teen birth rates and the recession. While the context doesn't invalidate the statement, it's less typical and might not be focused on the topic, making it a less likely scenario for such a discussion.\n\nTherefore, (a) Part of the decline can be attributed to the recession, expert says is more likely to be a context-appropriate and relevant discussion compared to the scenario presented in option (b).\nFinal Answer: (a) Part of the decline can be attributed to the recession, expert says.",

This stance aligns with attempting to reduce violence or halt further escalation by limiting access to weapons.\n- Option (b) introduces the idea that a sanctions group is condemning the sale of arms with the intention of improving educational facilities. This option appears less coherent as sales of arms typically do not directly relate to educational facilities. The connection between the two is unconventional and not typically addressed in sanctions or arms control dialogues.\n\nConclusion:\nGiven that sanctions groups commonly focus on restricting arms to reduce violence and conflict, and considering the lack of logical connection in option (b), the more likely scenario is:\n(a) A sanctions group deplores sales of arms to Syria.",
