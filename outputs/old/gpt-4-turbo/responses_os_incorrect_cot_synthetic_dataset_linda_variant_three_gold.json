Stiffness, particularly in the morning or after periods of inactivity, is common due to joint inflammation and pain.\n4. **Combination of Symptoms**: When considering arthritis and its impact, common associated symptoms include both muscle weakness (due to decreased mobility and inflammation) and movement stiffness (due to joint problems).\n\nNow, comparing the options:\n(a) She also experiences muscle weakness and movement stiffness.\n(b) She also experiences muscle weakness.\n\n**Answer Justification**:\nWhile muscle weakness can occur with arthritis, it often co-occurs with movement stiffness as part of the broader symptomatology of arthritis. Therefore, the option that includes both symptoms common in arthritis (muscle weakness and movement stiffness) would be the more comprehensive and, thus, more likely scenario. \n\nThe correct answer is:\n(a) She also experiences muscle weakness and movement stiffness.",
