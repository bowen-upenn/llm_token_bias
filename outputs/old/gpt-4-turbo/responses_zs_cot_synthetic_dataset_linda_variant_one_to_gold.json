This demonstrates a resurgence of interest and commitment to regaining lost skills.\n\n2. **Outcome of Recent Practice:** The protagonist notes improved agility in their fingers and a retrieval of former capabilities by practicing with old music sheets. This indicates a positive result from their practice, which would likely motivate further practice.\n\n3. **Information Provided About Motivation:** The excerpt mentions the protagonist's return to routine and regaining of previous skill levels. However, there is no mention of external motivations such as an upcoming concert.\n\n4. **Evaluating Options:**\n   - **Option (a):** suggests that the protagonist would likely continue practicing piano regularly based simply on the progress and internal motivation observed.\n   - **Option (b):** introduces a specific additional goal - preparing for an upcoming concert. This would be a plausible scenario, but it is not supported by any direct statement or hint within the given text.\n\n**Conclusion:** Option (a) \"The protagonist would likely continue practicing piano regularly\" aligns more closely with the provided information and does not make assumptions beyond what is stated. There is no indication in the text about preparing for a concert as a motivating factor, thus making option (b) a less likely choice based purely on the data provided.",

It is reasonable to infer that because of her physical discomfort, Kate might engage in activities to relieve her stiffness.

Jake cancelled their date, which evidently made Maria upset.\n2. Maria rejected Jake's phone calls, indicating she did not want to communicate with him.\n3. Maria also did not let Jake in when he visited her house, further showing her reluctance to interact with him.\n\nChoice (a) mentions that Maria \"might ignore Jake's further attempts to contact her.\" This is a logical extension of her current behavior and thus a possible scenario.

While this could lead to disappointment, it doesn't explicitly suggest that their motivation was to set a record; it simply shows they enjoyed the activity.\n\n4. **Likelihood of Rebuilding (Option a)**: Given that they spent a lot of time and planned further embellishments, it's reasonable to think they might want to rebuild. Enjoying the process could be motivation enough to start over, hoping maybe to use their previous experience to build it better or simply to enjoy the activity again.\n\n5. **Setting a Record (Option b)**: This option introduces a specific additional motivation \u2014 building another sand castle to beat a record. There\u2019s no indication in the text that setting a record was a motivation in their earlier activity. The information provided does not mention any record-setting ambitions; it only details their enjoyment of the activity and their disappointment at its loss.\n\n**Conclusion**: Based on the information given, (a) The protagonist would likely start building another sand castle is the more likely scenario. It aligns with what we know about Ed and Jenny's motivations and the narrative provided. Option (b) assumes additional, unsupported motivations.
