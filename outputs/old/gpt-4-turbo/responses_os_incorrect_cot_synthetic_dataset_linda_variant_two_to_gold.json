This is straightforward and aligns typically with promotional responses in competitive businesses.\n   - **Option (b)** adds an additional layer to the giveaway \u2013 that it's done to raise money for charity. While this is altruistic and could enhance IHOP's public image, it is a more specific scenario. Adding the charitable element complicates the logistics and motivations somewhat.\n\n4. **Probability Assessment**: Given the lack of direct evidence from the provided information connecting IHOP's motivation to charity, and considering that promotional responses usually aim directly at boosting business or image (rather than fundraising), option (a) might be regarded as more straightforward and thus more likely.\n\nThe most probable option, based solely on the typical motivations for a competitor responding to another's promotional event, would be:\n(a) Competitor IHOP to give away pancakes on February 24.",

This is consistent with the content outlined above, as civilian casualties often lead to public uproar and controversy.\n\n- **Option (b)** extends option (a) by including the potential for these events to \"cause a significant international incident.\" While civilian casualties can indeed escalate tensions, the provided text does not specifically mention any significant international repercussions beyond the dispute and furor.\n\nWithout further explicit information indicating larger international consequences (such as formal statements, threats, or diplomatic moves), it is safer and more probable to choose the option that aligns closely with the given information without assuming additional implications.\n\n**Answer: (a) The news comes amid public furor over civilians killed in drone strikes.**",
