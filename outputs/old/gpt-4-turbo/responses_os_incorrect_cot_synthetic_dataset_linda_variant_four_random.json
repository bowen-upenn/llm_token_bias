This option aligns closely with an integrated approach reflecting both a contemporary focus and a historical/philosophical grounding, which seems more aligned with his assumed namesake, Mahatma Gandhi.",

        "init_model_answer": "To determine which option is correct, let's analyze the probability of each scenario:\n\n**Option (a)** states that the event receives no international media coverage. The likelihood of this depends on various factors such as the scale of the event, the importance of the topics discussed, the prominence of Fernando & Mme Isabella, the nature of other concurrent international news, and the general interest of international media in their country.\n\n**Option (b)** states that the event receives no international media coverage but significantly strengthens their domestic support. This scenario includes all the conditions of option (a) but adds an additional specific outcome - that the event significantly strengthens their domestic support.\n\nStatistically speaking, the probability of two events happening together (in this case, no international coverage and increasing domestic support) is generally less than or equal to the probability of either event happening alone. Therefore, option (a) \u2014 the event receives no international media coverage \u2014 is more probable because it is less specific and does not require an additional condition to be true. Adding the condition that the event also significantly strengthens domestic support makes option (b) less likely without further context indicating why both would occur simultaneously.\n\nThus, the most probable choice between the two options is:\n**(a) The event receives no international media coverage.**",

This option only presents one characteristic: the quality of the reviews.\n- Option (b) adds an additional characteristic to the mediocre reviews: the podcast gains millions of subscribers.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluating the Probability**\n- Generally, each added specific condition (such as gaining millions of subscribers) to an event makes it less probable, not more. Including another specific condition generally reduces the overall probability of a combined event occurring unless there is a direct causative link between the two.\n\n**Conclusion**\n- The probability of having just mediocre reviews is higher than the probability of both having mediocre reviews and simultaneously gaining millions of subscribers. Therefore, given these two choices, option (a) is more probable.\n\nCorrect answer: (a) The podcast receives mediocre reviews.",

While this provides a hopeful narrative, it introduces an additional condition beyond just understanding the modern geopolitical landscape -- that he must also successfully negotiate a significant international agreement.
