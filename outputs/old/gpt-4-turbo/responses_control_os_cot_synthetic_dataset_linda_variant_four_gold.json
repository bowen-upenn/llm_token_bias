This is based on the principle that the likelihood of a single event occurring is always greater than the likelihood of that event occurring in conjunction with an additional condition. In this case, the probability of the book becoming a bestseller (event A) will always be higher than the probability of it becoming a bestseller and being heavily criticized by Western scholars (event A and event B).",

This is because, statistically, the probability of a single event (implementing a completely free-market system) is always higher than the probability of that event occurring in conjunction with another specific condition (maintaining strong state control over key industries). Thus, option (a) is more likely than option (b), which involves a conjunction of two specific conditions.",
