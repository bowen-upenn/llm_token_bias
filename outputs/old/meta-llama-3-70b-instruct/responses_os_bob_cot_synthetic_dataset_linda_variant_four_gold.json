After all, he was a skilled politician and orator who was known for his ability to connect with people through his speeches.\n\nGiven this, it's more likely that FDR would decide to give a speech rather than not giving one at all. Therefore, option (a) \"FDR would decide not to give any speech\" is less likely.\n\nNow, if FDR were to give a speech, his presence alone would undoubtedly generate significant public interest in historical political decisions and their impacts on today's issues.

While social media campaigns can certainly boost an album's popularity, it's still a long shot to go from not charting at all to becoming a top-ten hit.\n\nSo, between the two options, I think option (a) is more likely: The album will not not chart in the first week.
