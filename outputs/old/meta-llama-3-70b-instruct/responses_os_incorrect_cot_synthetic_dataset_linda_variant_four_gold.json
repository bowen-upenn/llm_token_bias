This means the album will not be popular enough to appear on any music charts.\n\nOption (b) says the album won't chart in any country, but their world tour sells out all the major venues. This is an interesting combination - the album is not popular enough to chart, but their live performances are extremely popular and can sell out large venues.\n\nNow, let's think about the likelihood of each option. If the album doesn't chart in any country, it likely means it's not well-received by the public or critics. In that case, it's less likely that their world tour would sell out all the major venues. People usually attend concerts of artists who have popular music, and if the album isn't doing well, it's unlikely that many people would be interested in attending their concerts.\n\nSo, considering this, I would say that option (a) is more likely: The album won't chart in any country.\n\nMy answer is: (a) The album won't chart in any country.",

It was a time of high tension and mistrust between the USSR and USA.\n\nOption (a) suggests that Andropov becomes a favorite among American politicians, which implies a significant improvement in relations between the two countries. This seems unlikely given the historical context.\n\nOption (b) also suggests that Andropov becomes a favorite among American politicians, but adds the caveat that he fails to ease the tension between the USSR and USA. This scenario is more plausible because it acknowledges that even if Andropov makes a good impression, the underlying tensions between the two countries might not be resolved.\n\nTherefore, I select option (b) as the more likely scenario: He becomes a favorite among American politicians but fails to ease the tension between the USSR and USA.",

In that case, option (a) \"He loses every primary\" is a plausible outcome.\n\nHowever, considering Lyndon B. Johnson's experience and reputation as a skilled politician, it's also likely that he would still be able to garner some attention and influence policy discussions, even if he didn't win any primaries.

If Federer struggles in the early rounds, it's less likely that he'll be able to win every match in straight sets. Struggling in the early rounds implies that he might not be playing his best tennis, which increases the chances of him dropping a set or two.\n\nGiven this, I would choose option (a) as the more likely scenario.

This event is a conjunction of two events: losing in the primary elections and being chosen as the vice-presidential candidate again.\n\nSince option (b) includes all the conditions of option (a) plus an additional condition, it is less likely to occur than option (a). In other words, it's more probable that Kamala Harris will simply lose in the primary elections than that she will lose and also be chosen as the vice-presidential candidate again.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Kamala Harris will lose in the primary elections.",

This approach aligns better with China's economic development strategy, which has often involved a mix of market-oriented reforms and state guidance.\n\nTherefore, I would select:\n\n(b) He implements a completely free-market system but maintains strong state control over key industries.",
