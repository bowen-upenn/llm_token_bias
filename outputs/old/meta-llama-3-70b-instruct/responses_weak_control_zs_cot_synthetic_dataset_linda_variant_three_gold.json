Now, let's consider the second option: \"He experiences burning micturition and has a foul smell of urine.\"\n4. The probability of Roberto having a foul smell of urine, given that he has a UTI, is also possible but not as directly related to the diagnosis as burning micturition.\n5.

For Judy to experience both swelling of the stomach and abdominal pain, she must first experience swelling of the stomach (which is already possible).

So, option (a) \"He experiences cold hands and feet\" is a plausible consequence of his condition.\n2. Now, let's consider option (b) \"He experiences cold hands and feet and has brittle nails.\" Brittle nails are also a possible symptom of hypothyroidism.\n\nHere's the key insight: option (b) is a conjunction of two events: \"cold hands and feet\" and \"brittle nails\". For option (b) to be true, both conditions must be true simultaneously.\n\nSince option (a) is a necessary condition for option (b), the probability of option (a) must be higher than or equal to the probability of option (b).\n\nTherefore, I choose:\n\n(a) He experiences cold hands and feet.\n\nThis option is more likely because it's a broader statement that encompasses one of the possible symptoms of hypothyroidism, whereas option (b) is a more specific conjunction of two symptoms that may not both occur simultaneously.",
