We need to evaluate the two options:\n\n(a) Power-sharing deal signed by pair has been deadlocked since September\n(b) Power-sharing deal signed by pair has been deadlocked since September so that Mugabe is considering forming a government without opposition input.\n\nOption (a) simply states that the power-sharing deal has been deadlocked since September. This is a straightforward statement.\n\nOption (b) adds an additional clause to option (a), stating that Mugabe is considering forming a government without opposition input because of the deadlock.\n\nHere's the key point: option (b) is a conjunction of two events, whereas option (a) is a single event. In general, the probability of a conjunction of events is lower than or equal to the probability of each individual event.\n\nIn this case, the probability of \"Power-sharing deal signed by pair has been deadlocked since September\" (option a) is higher than the probability of \"Power-sharing deal signed by pair has been deadlocked since September so that Mugabe is considering forming a government without opposition input\" (option b).\n\nTherefore, I select option (a) as the more likely scenario.\n\nAnswer: (a)",

It's a straightforward statement.\n\nOption (b) adds an additional clause to option (a), providing a reason why Analina Rooms might have chosen that particular interior design. This additional information makes the statement more specific and detailed.\n\nHere's the key point: adding more detail or conditions to an event does not make it more likely to occur. In fact, it often makes it less likely, since there are more things that need to be true for the event to happen.\n\nTherefore, I choose option (a) as the more likely scenario:\n\n(a) In Madrid, Analina Rooms offers tastefully modernist brown-and-white interiors",

In fact, option (b) is a conjunction of two events: (1) the auction begins on Thursday and runs through May 22, and (2) collectors from around the world can participate.
