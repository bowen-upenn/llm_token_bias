It's likely that games will be developed to take advantage of these new features, especially the larger screen size.\n\nOption (a) simply states that games like Vainglory and Asphalt 8 will take advantage of the screen size, which is a reasonable expectation given the new features of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.\n\nOption (b) adds more information, stating that these games will not only take advantage of the screen size but also feature exclusive gameplay enhancements. This is also possible, as game developers might create special features or modes that are optimized for the larger screen size.\n\nConsidering the information provided, I would choose:\n\n(b) Games taking advantage of screen size will include Vainglory, Asphalt 8 to feature exclusive gameplay enhancements.\n\nThis option is more likely because it builds upon the reasonable expectation stated in option (a) and adds a plausible additional detail about exclusive gameplay enhancements.",

This suggests that there is a possibility that fans might try to visit Michael Jackson's grave, and the funeral company is being secretive about its location.\n\nGiven this information, which option is more likely?\n\nI would choose:\n\n(b) Funeral company has stringent security patrol to keep fans from visiting Michael Jackson's specific grave site.\n\nThis option makes sense because the funeral company would want to protect the grave site from overzealous fans and maintain some level of privacy.",
