        "question": "Consider a regular eight-sided spinner with five orange sections and three violet sections. The spinner will be spun 30 times and the sequence of orange (O) and violet (V) will be recorded. You are asked to select one sequence, from a set of three, and you will win $50 if the sequence you chose appears on successive spins of the spinner. Which sequence do you prefer to bet?\n(a) VVVVOOO.\n(b) VVOVOOO.\n(c) VVVOOO.",

        "init_model_answer": "Let's break it down step by step.\n\nSince the spinner has 5 orange sections and 3 violet sections, we can assume that the probability of getting an orange (O) on a single spin is 5/8, and the probability of getting a violet (V) on a single spin is 3/8.\n\nNow, let's analyze each sequence:\n\n(a) VVVVOOO: This sequence has 3 consecutive V's followed by 4 consecutive O's. The probability of getting this exact sequence is (3/8)^3 \\* (5/8)^4 = (27/512) \\* (625/1024) = 16875/4194304.\n\n(b) VVOVOOO: This sequence has alternating V's and O's, with 2 V's and 4 O's. The probability of getting this exact sequence is (3/8)^2 \\* (5/8)^2 \\* (3/8) \\* (5/8)^2 = (9/64) \\* (25/64) \\* (3/8) \\* (25/64) = 3375/4194304.\n\n(c) VVVOOO: This sequence has 3 consecutive V's followed by 3 consecutive O's. The probability of getting this exact sequence is (3/8)^3 \\* (5/8)^3 = (27/512) \\* (125/512) = 3375/4194304.\n\nNotice that options (b) and (c) have the same probability! However, option (a) has a slightly lower probability.\n\nSo, based on the probabilities, I would choose option (b) or option (c), as they are equally likely to occur. But if I had to pick one, I'd say:\n\n(b) VVOVOOO",
