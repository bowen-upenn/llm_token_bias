Based on what we know about Gandhi's character and philosophy, it is unlikely that he would use aggressive and derogatory language.

Let's say the probability of Canelo losing by knockout is x.\n\nOption (b) says \"Canelo will lose by knockout but will win the rematch.\" This is a compound event, consisting of two sub-events:\n\n1. Canelo loses by knockout (same as option a)\n2. Canelo wins the rematch\n\nFor option (b) to be true, both sub-events must occur. The probability of option (b) is therefore the product of the probabilities of the two sub-events: x \u00d7 y, where y is the probability of Canelo winning the rematch.\n\nSince the probability of option (b) depends on two events occurring, it is generally lower than the probability of option (a), which only requires one event to occur.\n\nTherefore, I select:\n\n(a) Canelo will lose by knockout.\n\nThis option is more likely because it only requires one event to occur, whereas option (b) requires two events to occur.",

This is a conjunction of two events: the podcast receives mediocre reviews, and it gains millions of subscribers.\n\nIn general, the probability of a conjunction of events is less than or equal to the probability of each individual event. This is because the conjunction requires both events to occur, which is a more specific and restrictive outcome.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that:\n\nThe correct answer is (a) The podcast receives mediocre reviews.\n\nThe reason is that option (a) only requires one event to occur (mediocre reviews), whereas option (b) requires two events to occur (mediocre reviews and gaining millions of subscribers), making it less probable.",

This is a more complex and unlikely scenario, as it requires Marshall to not only overcome his initial struggles but also achieve a significant diplomatic success.\n\nGiven these considerations, I would argue that statement (a) is more probable than statement (b).
