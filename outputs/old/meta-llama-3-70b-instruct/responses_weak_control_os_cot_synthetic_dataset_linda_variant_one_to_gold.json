It's reasonable to assume that he would continue wearing them in general. Option (b) adds an additional condition - \"to work\" - which might not be true. Maybe Jordan works from home, or maybe he has a dress code that doesn't allow him to wear those pants to work.

This is a more specific and restrictive scenario than option (a).\n\nUsing probability theory, we know that the probability of two events occurring together (the conjunction) is always less than or equal to the probability of either event occurring individually.

This is a general statement about Adam's personality or behavior.\n\nOption (b) adds a specific detail to option (a), stating that the attention and reactions are specifically due to his new haircut. This additional information doesn't change the fact that Adam enjoys the attention and reactions, but rather provides context for why he's receiving them.\n\nSince option (b) is a more specific scenario that includes all the conditions of option (a), it can't be more probable than option (a). In other words, if Adam enjoys the attention and reactions from his peers to his new haircut, he must also enjoy the attention and reactions from his peers in general.\n\nTherefore, I select:\n\n(a) Adam would likely enjoy the attention and reactions from his peers.\n\nThis answer avoids the conjunction fallacy by recognizing that adding more specific details doesn't increase the probability of an event.",
