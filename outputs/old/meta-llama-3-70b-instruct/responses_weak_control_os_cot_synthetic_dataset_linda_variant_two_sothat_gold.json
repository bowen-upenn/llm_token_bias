This is a straightforward statement with no additional conditions or assumptions.\n\nOption (b) adds more information to the statement in option (a). It provides a reason why the finance minister is expected to deliver the budget statement: to address the economic downturn and propose solutions to mitigate the impact of reduced GDP.\n\nHere's the key insight: adding more specific details or conditions to an event does not increase its probability. In fact, it often decreases the probability because it becomes a more restrictive scenario.\n\nIn this case, option (b) is a conjunction of two events: the finance minister delivering the budget statement and addressing the economic downturn. The probability of both events occurring together is lower than the probability of just one event occurring (the finance minister delivering the budget statement).\n\nTherefore, I conclude that:\n\n(a) Finance minister expected to deliver the 2009 budget statement Thursday\n\nis more probable than option (b).",

To do this, we need to consider the probability of each statement.\n\nOption (a) simply states that more than 1,500 homes are under evacuation orders. This is a straightforward statement about the number of homes affected.\n\nOption (b) adds an additional condition to the statement in option (a). It provides a reason why more than 1,500 homes are under evacuation orders: so that firefighters can concentrate efforts on protecting critical infrastructure and natural resources.\n\nHere's the key point: adding this additional condition does not increase the probability of the initial statement being true.

This is because option b requires multiple conditions to be true (the bank lost \u00a356m, the company went bust, and the millionaire used the money to fund his lifestyle), whereas option a only requires one condition to be true (the bank lost \u00a356m).\n\n5.
