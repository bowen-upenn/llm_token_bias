It's reasonable to assume that she would want to prepare herself for the adventure.\n\nOption (a) states that Jennifer would prepare her equipment and research common ghost hunting techniques. This is a very plausible and logical step for someone who wants to go on a ghost hunt. She would likely want to know what equipment is needed and how to use it, as well as learn about different techniques used in ghost hunting.\n\nOption (b) adds an additional detail, stating that she would prepare her equipment and research common ghost hunting techniques \"to ensure she can effectively communicate with any spirits she encounters.\" While this is still a possible scenario, it's a more specific and detailed goal than just preparing for the ghost hunt in general.\n\nGiven the information, I think it's more likely that Jennifer would prepare her equipment and research common ghost hunting techniques in general, without necessarily having the specific goal of communicating with spirits in mind.\n\nSo, my answer is: (a) Jennifer would prepare her equipment and research common ghost hunting techniques.",

This is a reasonable response to his situation, as he needs to take care of the blister to alleviate the pain and discomfort.\n\nOption (b) adds an additional motivation for seeking medical treatment: to ensure he can participate in the marathon the next day. While this is certainly a relevant consideration for Kevin, it doesn't change the fact that he needs to seek medical treatment for his blister regardless of the marathon.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that both options are possible, but option (a) is a more general and fundamental response to Kevin's situation.

It's likely that Tom would want to commemorate this special moment.\n\nOption (a) states that Tom would likely ask the band members for autographs or take photos with them. This is a very plausible scenario, as fans often ask for autographs or take photos with celebrities as a way to remember the encounter.\n\nOption (b) adds an extra detail, stating that Tom would likely ask the band members for autographs or take photos with them to share on his social media. While it's possible that Tom might want to share his experience on social media, this isn't necessarily a guaranteed outcome.\n\nGiven the information provided, I would choose option (a) as the more likely scenario. Meeting the band members and asking for autographs or taking photos is a more direct and immediate response to the surprise encounter, whereas sharing on social media is an additional step that may or may not happen.\n\nSo, my answer is: (a) Tom would likely ask the band members for autographs or take photos with them.",

After getting lost due to not being able to read street signs, it's reasonable to assume that Sam would start wearing glasses while driving at night.\n\nOption (b) adds an additional reason for Sam to start wearing glasses while driving at night, which is to avoid getting lost again. While this reason is related to the events in the passage, it's not necessarily a more likely outcome than simply starting to wear glasses while driving at night.\n\nIn fact, option (b) is a more specific and detailed outcome than option (a), but it's not necessarily more probable. The probability of Sam starting to wear glasses while driving at night is already high due to the inconvenience he experienced, and adding the reason \"to avoid getting lost again\" doesn't significantly increase the likelihood.\n\nTherefore, I would choose:\n\n(a) The protagonist would likely start wearing glasses while driving at night.",

Option (b) adds an additional condition, which is earning a significant income.\n\nSince the additional condition in option (b) is not necessary for the protagonist to achieve their primary goal of helping people, option (a) is more likely.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n(a) The protagonist would likely develop software programs that address user-specific issues.",

Now, we need to decide which option is more likely:\n\n(a) Mark would continue training to increase his pull-up count beyond ten.\n(b) Mark would continue training to increase his pull-up count beyond ten to achieve a new goal of twenty pull-ups.\n\nOption (a) simply states that Mark will continue training to increase his pull-up count beyond ten, without specifying a new target. Option (b) adds a specific new goal of twenty pull-ups.\n\nSince we don't have any additional information about Mark's goals or motivations beyond the initial goal of ten pull-ups, it's more likely that Mark will simply continue training to increase his pull-up count beyond ten (without a specific new target in mind).\n\nSo, my answer is:\n(a) Mark would continue training to increase his pull-up count beyond ten.",
