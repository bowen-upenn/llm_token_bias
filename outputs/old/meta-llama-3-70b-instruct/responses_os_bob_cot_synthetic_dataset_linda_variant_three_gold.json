While it's true that people with Migraine are more likely to experience depression, there isn't a direct correlation between Migraine and acidity. \n\nOn the other hand, depression is a common comorbidity with Migraine, meaning that people with Migraine are more likely to experience depression as well.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, I would select option (b) John also experiences depression.\n\nIs that correct?",
