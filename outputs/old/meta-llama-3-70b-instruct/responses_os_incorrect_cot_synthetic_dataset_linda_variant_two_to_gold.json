The additional detail about the spring rolls being among the best outside of Manila adds credibility to the claim that lines would form early.\n\nSo, my answer is:\n\n(b) Lines form early for Lumpia Shack's Philippines-inspired food to experience some of the best spring rolls served outside of Manila.",
