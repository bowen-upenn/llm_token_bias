It says that the album might not be very successful overall, but one of its singles will be extremely successful and top the charts for several weeks.\n\nConsidering these options, I think option (b) is less likely than option (a). Why? Because if an album doesn't reach the top 10, it's already unlikely to be very successful. But then, if one of its singles tops the charts for several weeks, that means there's a significant contradiction between the album's performance and the single's performance. It's possible, but less likely.\n\nSo, my answer is:\n\n(a) The album doesn't reach the top 10 on the Billboard charts.",
