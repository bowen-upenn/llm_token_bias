The White House's response to this incident is the focus of the question.\n\nOption (a) states that the White House said the incident was a provocation and raised an objection with Beijing. This is a very likely response, given the circumstances. The White House would likely condemn the aggressive behavior of the Chinese jet and express its concerns to the Chinese government.\n\nOption (b) adds an additional detail to the White House's response: that the US wants to emphasize its commitment to maintaining freedom of navigation in the region. While this is also a plausible response, it's not necessarily more likely than option (a). The White House might have simply condemned the incident without explicitly mentioning freedom of navigation.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, I would choose:\n\n(a) White House said the incident was a provocation, raised objection with Beijing.\n\nThis option is more probable because it's a more basic and expected response from the White House, whereas option (b) adds an additional detail that might not be necessary or certain.",

The passage describes Robert Lyons as committing a heinous crime, including bashing his mother over the head and stabbing her multiple times.\n2. It then states that he poured insecticides and chemicals over her body.\n3. The question asks which is more likely: that Robert was found in Hooters hours later, or that he was found in Hooters hours later to establish an alibi for the time of the murder.\n\nGiven the gruesome nature of the crime, it's unlikely that Robert would be calmly sitting in Hooters hours later, regardless of his motivations. However, option (b) adds an additional layer of complexity by suggesting that Robert was trying to establish an alibi. This implies a level of planning and cunning that may not be justified by the initial description of the crime.\n\nTherefore, the more straightforward option (a) - that Robert was simply found in Hooters hours later - is the more likely scenario.",

        "init_model_answer": "Let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe first statement says \"Ukraine's president meets with the heads of NATO countries in Wales.\" This suggests that Ukraine is already engaging with NATO in some capacity.\n\nThe second statement says \"Ukraine is bolstering its military partnership with NATO, Poroshenko says.\" This reinforces the idea that Ukraine is strengthening its ties with NATO.\n\nThe third statement says \"He says he's 'ready . . . to stop the war,' hopes talks with rebels lead to peace.\" This indicates that Ukraine's president is interested in finding a peaceful resolution to the conflict.\n\nNow, let's consider the two options:\n\n(a) NATO's chief cautions that earlier Moscow's remarks on peace went nowhere\n(b) NATO's chief cautions that earlier Moscow's remarks on peace went nowhere so that military collaborations will need to be strengthened further.\n\nOption (a) simply states that NATO's chief is skeptical about Moscow's previous peace efforts. This is a neutral or negative statement that doesn't necessarily imply any specific action.\n\nOption (b) adds an additional clause, stating that because Moscow's previous peace efforts were unsuccessful, military collaborations will need to be strengthened further. This implies a more proactive or aggressive response from NATO.\n\nGiven the context of Ukraine strengthening its partnership with NATO and seeking a peaceful resolution, I think option (a) is more likely. The focus is on cautioning about Moscow's intentions rather than escalating military collaborations.\n\nSo, my answer is: (a) NATO's chief cautions that earlier Moscow's remarks on peace went nowhere.",

This is a straightforward statement.\n\nOption (b) adds an additional reason to the fact stated in option (a): the agency said that bags were not properly screened because they wanted to reduce staff workload. This adds a motive or intention behind the agency's statement.\n\nIn general, when we are given two options, and one option is a subset of the other, the simpler option (the subset) is usually more likely. In this case, option (a) is a simpler statement that does not imply any motives or intentions, whereas option (b) adds an additional layer of complexity.\n\nTherefore, I would choose:\n\n(a) Agency said bags not properly screened\n\nas the more likely option.",
