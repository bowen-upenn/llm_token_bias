The probability of each sequence is the same, which is (1/2)^20, since there are 20 rolls and each roll has a 1/2 chance of being Indigo or Blue.

The key is to recognize that each spin of the spinner is an independent event, and the probability of a sequence is determined by the product of the probabilities of each individual spin. Since each spin has a 5/8 chance of being Navy and a 3/8 chance of being Fuchsia, all three sequences have the same probability of occurring.
