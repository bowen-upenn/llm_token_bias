Option (b) adds additional information to option (a), stating that Derek Ward died in an apparent suicide to escape the shame and guilt from killing his mother.\n\nNow, let's think about probability:\n\n* Option (a) only states that Derek Ward died by suicide, which is a single event.\n* Option (b) combines two events: Derek Ward died by suicide AND he did so because he felt shame and guilt from killing his mother.\n\nIn general, the probability of two events occurring together (the conjunction) is lower than or equal to the probability of either event occurring alone. In this case, the probability of Derek Ward dying by suicide (option a) is higher than the probability of him dying by suicide specifically because he felt shame and guilt from killing his mother (option b).\n\nTherefore, I select option (a) as the more likely scenario.",

Option (a) states a simple fact: \"The four were taken at a roadblock about 50 miles from Tripoli\".\n3. Option (b) adds an additional detail to option (a): \"...to cover a story on conflict developments in the region\".\n\nNow, here's the key insight: adding more details to an event does not make it more likely to occur. In fact, the probability of two events occurring together (the conjunction) is always less than or equal to the probability of each individual event.\n\nIn this case, option (a) is a more general statement, while option (b) is a more specific statement that includes the additional detail about covering a story. Since the additional detail doesn't provide any new information that would increase the likelihood of the event, we can conclude that option (a) is more likely.\n\nSo, my answer is:\n\n(a) The four were taken at a roadblock about 50 miles from Tripoli",
