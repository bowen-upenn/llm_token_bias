The protagonist's friend wanted to trade with them, and the friend is smaller than the protagonist.\n\nSince the friend is smaller, they would likely fit into the medium shirt that the protagonist has. And since the protagonist is larger, they would likely fit into the large shirt that the friend has.\n\nSo, after the trade, the protagonist would end up with a large shirt, which would be too big for them.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) The protagonist would likely wear a shirt that is too large for them.",

Both options (a) and (b) suggest that he might photograph or sketch the sunset.\n\nHowever, option (b) adds an additional detail that seems less likely.
