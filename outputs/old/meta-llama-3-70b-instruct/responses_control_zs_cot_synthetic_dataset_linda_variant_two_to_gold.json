This is a single event.\n\nOption (b) states that Kepler has found 3,538 planet candidates to date to have at least one potentially habitable planet. This is a conjunction of two events: finding planet candidates and having at least one potentially habitable planet.\n\nAccording to the probability rule, the probability of a conjunction (P(A and B)) is always less than or equal to the probabilities of its constituents (P(A) or P(B)). In this case, finding planet candidates (A) is a necessary condition for finding potentially habitable planets (B).\n\nTherefore, I choose option (a) as the more likely event: Kepler has found 3,538 planet candidates to date.",
