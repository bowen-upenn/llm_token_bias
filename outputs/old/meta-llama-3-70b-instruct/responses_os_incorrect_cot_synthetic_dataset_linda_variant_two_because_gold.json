Option (a) simply states that Israel fears the aid would bolster Hamas. Option (b) adds an additional reason for this fear: that it would violate existing sanctions against the terrorist organization.\n\nGiven the context, it's reasonable to assume that Israel's fear of aiding Hamas is closely related to the fact that Hamas is a terrorist organization subject to sanctions.

It also mentions that some individuals are being treated for broken hands, claiming they were tortured.\n\nNow, let's look at the two options:\n\n(a) Mugabe laughed and mugged for reporters as he cast his ballot at a high school\n(b) Mugabe laughed and mugged for reporters as he cast his ballot at a high school because they believed his supporters were more likely to engage in violent acts.\n\nConsidering the context of the passage, which describes violence and torture allegedly committed by Mugabe's supporters, option (b) provides a more plausible reason for Mugabe's behavior. It suggests that despite the allegations of violence, Mugabe is confident and carefree enough to laugh and mug for reporters.\n\nTherefore, I choose option (b) as the more likely scenario.",
