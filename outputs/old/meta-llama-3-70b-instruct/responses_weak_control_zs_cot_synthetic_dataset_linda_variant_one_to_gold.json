The scenario sets up Derek as a new kid who is nervous and alone on his first day of school.\n2. A group of kids approaches him and asks him to play, which makes Derek relieved.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(a) Derek would join the group of kids to play.\n(b) Derek would join the group of kids to play to make new friends.\n\nOption (a) simply states that Derek will join the group to play. This is a straightforward consequence of the situation, given that the kids asked him to play and he's relieved to have someone to play with.\n\nOption (b) adds an additional condition: that Derek joins the group to make new friends. While it's possible that making new friends might be a motivation for Derek, it's not necessarily implied by the scenario. We only know that he's relieved to have someone to play with, not that he's specifically looking to make friends.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, I would choose option (a) as the more likely outcome: Derek would join the group of kids to play.\n\nThe conjunction fallacy would occur if I were to choose option (b) as more likely, simply because it provides more detail or seems more plausible.

It's reasonable to assume that she would want to take care of it.\n\nOption (a) states that Kendall would regularly water and tend to her garden. This is a very plausible scenario, given her investment in the garden.\n\nOption (b) adds an additional detail: Kendall would regularly water and tend to her garden to ensure it attracted butterflies and hummingbirds. While this is still possible, it's a more specific and restrictive scenario than option (a).\n\nIn probability theory, the conjunction of two events (in this case, watering/tending the garden and attracting butterflies/hummingbirds) is always less likely than either event occurring individually. Therefore, option (b) is actually less likely than option (a).\n\nSo, my answer is:\n\n(a) Kendall would regularly water and tend to her garden.\n\nIt's more likely that Kendall would take care of her garden in general, rather than taking care of it for a specific reason (attracting butterflies and hummingbirds).",

The conjunction fallacy occurs when we overestimate the likelihood of a conjunction of events compared to one of its individual components.\n\nIn this case, option (a) is more likely than option (b) because it's a broader and more general scenario.
