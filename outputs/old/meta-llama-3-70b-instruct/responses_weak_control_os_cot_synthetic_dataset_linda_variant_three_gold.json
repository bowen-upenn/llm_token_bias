Option (b) adds an additional symptom, brittle nails, which is also a possible symptom of hypothyroidism.\n\nNow, let's think about probability:\n\n* Option (a) only requires one symptom to be true (cold hands and feet).\n* Option (b) requires two symptoms to be true (cold hands and feet AND brittle nails).\n\nSince option (b) is a more specific and restrictive scenario, it is less likely to occur than option (a). In other words, it's more probable that Rohit experiences cold hands and feet alone than experiencing both cold hands and feet AND brittle nails.\n\nTherefore, I select:\n\n(a) He experiences cold hands and feet.\n\nThis answer avoids the conjunction fallacy by recognizing that adding more conditions to an event makes it less probable, not more probable.",

Now, we need to compare the two options:\n\n(a) Morgan also experiences dehydration and sunken eyes.\n(b) Morgan also experiences dehydration.\n\nOption (b) is a subset of option (a). In other words, if Morgan experiences dehydration and sunken eyes, they necessarily experience dehydration. However, the converse is not true: experiencing dehydration does not imply experiencing dehydration and sunken eyes.\n\nTherefore, it is more likely that Morgan experiences dehydration (option b) than experiencing both dehydration and sunken eyes (option a).\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n(b) Morgan also experiences dehydration.",
