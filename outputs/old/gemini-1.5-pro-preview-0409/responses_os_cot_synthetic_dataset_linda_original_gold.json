        "target_answer": "(a) Raj is a passenger vehicle driver",
        "retry": false,
        "use_multi_agents": false,
        "init_model_answer": "## Analyzing Raj's Profile:\n\nFollowing the same logic as the Linda example, we can break down the probabilities:\n\n* **(a) Raj is a passenger vehicle driver:** This option considers only one aspect of Raj's potential career path. \n* **(b) Raj is a passenger vehicle driver and enjoys participating in hackathons and coding competitions:** This option adds a layer of specificity by including Raj's interest in coding competitions. \n\n## Applying the Logic:\n\nJust like in the Linda example, where being a bank teller was more probable than being a bank teller and active in the feminist movement (due to the additional condition), the same applies here. \n\nTherefore, the more probable option is: \n\n**(a) Raj is a passenger vehicle driver.** \n",
