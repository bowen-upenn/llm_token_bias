Since each roll of the die is independent of the previous rolls, the probability of a specific sequence of Indigos and Blues in any given order for a roll is dependent on the number of Indigos (I) and Blues (B) in that sequence.\n\nLet's analyze the provided sequences:\n(a) IIBIBBII has 4 Indigos and 4 Blues.\n(b) IIBIBBI has 4 Indigos and 3 Blues.\n(c) IIBBIBBI has 4 Indigos and 4 Blues.\n\nTo calculate the probability of each sequence occurring in a single roll, we need to consider the frequency of Indigos and Blues on the die:\n\nThe probability of rolling an Indigo = 5/6\nThe probability of rolling a Blue = 1/6\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities for each sequence:\n(a) IIBIBBII:\nP(a) = (5/6)(5/6)(1/6)(5/6)(1/6)(1/6)(5/6)(5/6) = (5/6)^10*(1/6)^5\n\n(b) IIBIBBI:\nP(b) = (5/6)(5/6)(1/6)(5/6)(1/6)(5/6)(1/6) = (5/6)^6*(1/6)^2\n\n(c) IIBBIBBI:\nP(c) = (5/6)(5/6)(1/6)(1/6)(5/6)(1/6)(5/6)(1/6) = (5/6)^8*(1/6)^3\n\nComparing the probabilities:\nP(a) > P(b) > P(c)\n\nTherefore, the sequence with the highest probability is (a) IIBIBBII.
