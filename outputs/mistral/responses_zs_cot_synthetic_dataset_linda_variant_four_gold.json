        "init_model_answer": "The Rolling Stones are a globally recognized and popular band with a long history of successful albums and tours. Therefore, it's highly unlikely that their new album wouldn't chart in any country. However, between the two options given, (b) is more plausible than (a). The reason is that even if the album, for some reason, doesn't chart, their popularity and fan base are such that a world tour could still sell out major venues. But, as previously stated, it's highly unlikely that their album wouldn't chart at all.",
