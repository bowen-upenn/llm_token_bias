So that's another 13 races.\n- In the third round, we will have the 13 fastest horses from each of the previous races, which means we need another 13 races.\n- In each subsequent round, the number of races will be the same until we have raced the 3 fastest horses from the previous round.\n\nGiven the above pattern, we can calculate the total number of races needed:\n\n13 (first round) + 13 (second round) + 13 (third round) = 39 races\n\nTherefore, you will need 39 races to determine the fastest 3 horses out of 169.",
