To calculate the probability of this sequence appearing on successive spins, we need to find the number of ways this sequence can occur in a 20-spin sequence. \n\nIn the sequence CCCCCYCY, we have 5 C's and 3 Y's. We can treat all the C's as a single entity, represented as X, and consider the number of ways X can be arranged among the 20 spins. This can be done in (20-5+1) = 16 ways. \n\nNow, we need to consider the placement of the Y in the remaining spaces. The Y must go in the 15th slot to satisfy the condition of the sequence CCCCCYCY. Hence, the number of ways to arrange the Y is 1.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways the sequence CCCCCYCY can occur in a 20-spin sequence is 16 * 1 = 16.\n\n(b) Following the same logic, for the sequence CCCCCCYC, the number of ways this sequence can occur in a 20-spin sequence is also 16.\n\n(c) Lastly, for the sequence CCCCCYC, to satisfy this sequence, the Y can occur in any of the 16th, 17th, or 18th slots.
