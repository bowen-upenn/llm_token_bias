Now, let's analyze the likelihood of each option.\n\n(a) The album doesn't reach the top 10 on the Billboard charts: This depends on various factors like promotion, competition, and fan reception. It is a common occurrence for albums to not break into the top 10 due to various reasons.\n\n(b) The album doesn't reach the top 10 on the Billboard charts but one of its singles tops the charts for several weeks: This scenario is less likely because for a single to top the charts for several weeks, it usually means the overall album is performing well. \n\nGiven this analysis, (a) The album doesn't reach the top 10 on the Billboard charts is more likely.",
