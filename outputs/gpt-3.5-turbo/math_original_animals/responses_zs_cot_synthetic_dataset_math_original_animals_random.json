Here's how we can do it step by step:\n\n1. **Step 1: First Round of Races**\n   - Race 5 kangaroos against each other. Let's denote the kangaroos as A, B, C, D, E.\n   - Let's say the ranking of kangaroos in this race is: A > B > C > D > E (where '>' represents a higher ranking).\n   \n2. **Step 2: Second Round of Races**\n   - We will perform races for the remaining ten kangaroos (F to O) in groups of five following the same procedure.\n   - Suppose in the following races, the results are as follows:\n     - F > G > H > I > J\n     - K > L > M > N > O\n     \n3. **Step 3: Playoff for Top Spots**\n   - Now we need to determine the top three fastest kangaroos from the winners of each race.\n   - We compare the winners of the previous races (A, F, and K) against each other to find the fastest kangaroo among them.\n   - Let's say the result is F > A > K. This means F is the fastest kangaroo, and A is the second fastest.\n   \n4. **Step 4: Determining the Third Fastest**\n   - To find the third fastest, we need to consider the remaining kangaroos. This includes B, C, D, E, G, H, I, J, L, M, N, and O. \n   - We can do this by setting up another race between a select number of kangaroos based on our current knowledge. Let's say in this race D > E > J > I > H > G > N > M > O > L > C > B.\n   \nBased on the described steps, it took us a total of **4 races** to determine the fastest 3 kangaroos from a group of 25 kangaroos.",

After R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5 are completed, record the top 3 hares from each race to identify 15 potential fastest hares. These hares will be the winners of each race and will form a subset of the potential top 3 hares.\n\n3. Now, we need to race these 15 potential fastest hares against each other. Since we can only race 5 hares at a time, we will need 3 additional races to find the fastest hare among these 15 hares. Let's call these races R6, R7, and R8.\n\n4. After R6, R7, and R8 are completed, we can determine the fastest hare overall among these 15 hares.\n\nTherefore, to find the fastest 3 hares in a group of 25 hares with these constraints, you will need a total of 8 races.",
