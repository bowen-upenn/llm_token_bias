This scenario involves a significant assumption about Sarah's motives and actions, which is not supported by the details in the scenario. Therefore, the likelihood of option (b) is lower than option (a) based on the information presented.\n\nTherefore, based on the given scenario and logical reasoning, option (a) Sarah G. released a genetically modified virus into the environment is more likely than option (b) Sarah G. released a genetically modified virus into the environment to sabotage a competing researcher\u2019s work.",
