There are 144 jackals, so we'll have 12 races in this round.\n\n2. **Round 2:**\n   - We take the top jackal from each of the 12 initial races and race them against each other. This will give us the top jackal overall from the initial 12 races.\n   - We need 1 race for this round.\n\n3. **Round 3:**\n   - We race the 2nd place finishers from the initial 12 races against each other. The winner of this race will be the 4th fastest jackal overall.\n   - We need 1 race for this round.\n\n4. **Round 4:**\n   - We now have the 1st, 2nd, and 4th fastest jackals identified.

From each race of 13, we take the top 3 jackals, and they need to be narrowed down to the top 3 overall.\n6. This means each round will only eliminate 10 jackals (13 - 3).\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of rounds needed:\n- 13 jackals - 3 races (10 jackals)\n- 10 jackals - 3 races (7 jackals)\n- 7 jackals - 3 races (4 jackals)\n- 4 jackals - 3 races (1 jackal)\n\nTherefore, we will need 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12 races.",

Since we can only race 13 ostriches at a time, we can eliminate all ostriches after 13th place in the first race. This way, in the worst-case scenario, ostriches placed 1 to 13 in the final race are guaranteed to be faster than all other ostriches. \n\nTherefore, we need to find the smallest number x such that 13*x >= 169. Solving this equation, we get x = 13. So, we need x = 13 races to determine the fastest ostrich.\n\nNext, we need to determine the second-fastest ostrich. We can eliminate the fastest ostrich from each previous race and repeat the process described above with the remaining ostriches. \n\nBy applying the same logic as above, we find that we need x = 13 races to determine the second-fastest ostrich. \n\nFinally, for the third-fastest ostrich, we need to repeat the process one more time, leading to an additional 13 races.\n\nAdding these three steps together, we get a total of 39 races needed to find the fastest 3 ostriches in a group of 169.",
