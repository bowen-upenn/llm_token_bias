We will eliminate the 8th position kangaroo from each of the initial races, as they are definitively not in the top 3. This leaves us with 8 kangaroos per initial race, making a total of 64 kangaroos (8 from each of the 8 initial races).\n\n4. **Races for Top 3**: Finally, we can conduct races to determine the top 3 fastest kangaroos. To do this, we can divide the remaining 64 kangaroos into 8 groups of 8 and conduct 8 more races.
