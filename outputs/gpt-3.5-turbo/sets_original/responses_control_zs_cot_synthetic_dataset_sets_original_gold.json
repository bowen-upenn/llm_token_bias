This establishes a clear relationship between the categories \"apples\" and \"fruits\". It includes all apples within the category of fruits.\n- Premise 2 states that some fruits are high in antioxidants. This does not specify which fruits in particular, only that at least certain fruits have this property.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion:\n- The conclusion states that some apples are high in antioxidants. This conclusion follows from the premises because if all apples are fruits (established in the first premise) and some fruits are high in antioxidants (established in the second premise), it is logical to conclude that at least some apples, which are included in the category of fruits, are high in antioxidants. Since not all fruits need to be high in antioxidants for this conclusion to be true, the statement is logically sound.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Yes.",
