Therefore, the probability of getting IIBBIBBI in a single roll is \\(\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^5 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^3\\).\n\nStep 2: Compare the probabilities of each sequence occurring on successive rolls.\n\n(a) \\(\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^5 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^3\\) = \\(\\left(\\frac{3125}{7776}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{216}\\right)\\)\n\n(b) \\(\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^6 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^2\\) = \\(\\left(\\frac{15625}{46656}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{36}\\right)\\)\n\n(c) \\(\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^5 \\",
