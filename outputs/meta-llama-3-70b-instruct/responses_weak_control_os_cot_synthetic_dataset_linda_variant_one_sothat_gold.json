This is a fairly common and reasonable behavior for someone visiting a scenic place like Moab, Utah.\n\n(b) The protagonist would likely take photographs of the landscapes and Arches in Moab, Utah so that they could share them on social media.\n\nThis option adds an additional condition to the first option: that the protagonist takes photographs specifically to share them on social media. While it's possible that the protagonist might do this, it's a more specific and restrictive scenario than option (a).\n\nNow, let's think about probability. A conjunction (in this case, taking photographs AND sharing them on social media) is always less probable than one of its individual components (taking photographs). This is because the conjunction requires both conditions to be true, whereas the individual component only requires one condition to be true.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that:\n\n(a) The protagonist would likely take photographs of the landscapes and Arches in Moab, Utah.\n\nis more probable than option (b).",
