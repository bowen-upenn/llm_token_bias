This is a reasonable response to the incident, as the US would likely want to express its concern about the aggressive behavior.\n\nOption (b) adds more context to the White House's response, stating that the objection was raised to emphasize the US commitment to maintaining freedom of navigation in the region. This additional context makes sense, given the location of the incident in the South China Sea, which is a contested region.\n\nConsidering the context, I think option (b) is more likely. The White House would not only object to the incident as a provocation but also use it as an opportunity to reiterate its commitment to freedom of navigation in the region.\n\nSo, my answer is: (b) White House said the incident was a provocation, raised objection with Beijing so that the U.S. could emphasize its commitment to maintaining freedom of navigation in the region.",
