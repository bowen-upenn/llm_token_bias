This suggests that he's frustrated with the delay.\n* Kevin accepted a bet with his sister, which implies that he wants to win.\n\nNow, let's consider the two options:\n\n(a) Kevin would complain to Laura about the pace of her washing.\n\nThis option simply states that Kevin would complain about Laura's pace. This is a plausible scenario, given Kevin's frustration and eagerness to finish drying the dishes.\n\n(b) Kevin would complain to Laura about the pace of her washing because he was eager to win the bet.\n\nThis option adds an additional reason for Kevin's complaint: his eagerness to win the bet. While this reason might be true, it doesn't change the fact that Kevin would still complain about Laura's pace. In fact, option (b) is a more specific version of option (a), as it provides a motivation for Kevin's complaint.\n\nAccording to the conjunction fallacy, people tend to overestimate the probability of a conjunction (two events occurring together) compared to one of its individual components.
