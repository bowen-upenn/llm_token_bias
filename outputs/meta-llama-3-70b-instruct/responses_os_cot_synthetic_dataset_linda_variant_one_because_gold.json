This suggests that she's already taken some steps to adjust to her new school environment.\n\nNow, let's consider the two options:\n\n(a) Julie might join a club or group that interests her.\n(b) Julie might join a club or group that interests her because she wants to make more friends.\n\nOption (a) simply states that Julie might join a club or group that interests her, without specifying a reason. This is a fairly neutral statement.\n\nOption (b) adds an extra layer of motivation, suggesting that Julie wants to join a club or group specifically to make more friends.\n\nGiven what we know about Julie's situation, both options are plausible. However, option (a) is a more general statement that doesn't require any additional assumptions. Option (b) assumes that Julie's primary motivation for joining a club or group is to make more friends, which might not be the case.\n\nTherefore, I would choose option (a) as the more likely scenario: Julie might join a club or group that interests her.",

As time went on, we realized how difficult and out of place we were. But once they finished, they greeted us with smiles. To our surprise, they took us into the group and we were so happy.\nWhich is more likely?\n(a) The protagonist would participate in the theater club activities and rehearsals.\n(b) The protagonist would participate in the theater club activities and rehearsals because they felt welcomed and accepted by the existing members.",

This is a straightforward and plausible scenario, given that Tom purchased the furniture on Craigslist.\n\nOption (b) adds additional information, stating that Tom would arrange to pick up the furniture because he was eager to use it to furnish his new apartment.
