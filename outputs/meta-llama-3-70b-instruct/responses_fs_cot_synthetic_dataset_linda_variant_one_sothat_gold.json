This is a very plausible scenario, given that the family is on a trip to see the beautiful landscape and they're excited about it. Taking photographs is a common activity when visiting scenic places, especially to capture memories.\n\nOption (b) adds an additional detail to option (a), stating that the protagonist would take photographs so that they could share them on social media. While it's possible that the protagonist might share their photos on social media, this added detail doesn't necessarily increase the likelihood of taking photographs in the first place.\n\nIn fact, option (b) is a more specific and restrictive scenario than option (a). It's possible that the protagonist might take photographs for other reasons, such as to keep as personal mementos or to show friends and family who aren't on social media.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that:\n\nThe correct answer is (a) The protagonist would likely take photographs of the landscapes and Arches in Moab, Utah.",

As a naturalist, he appreciates nature's beauty, and this sunset is particularly striking. It's likely that he would want to capture this moment in some way, whether to preserve the memory for himself or to share it with others.\n\nHowever, option (b) adds an additional layer of motivation - sharing the beauty with others later. While this is possible, it's not necessarily a guarantee. Maybe Terence just wants to capture the moment for his own personal enjoyment or to study it further.\n\nGiven this, I would choose option:\n\n(a) Terence would likely photograph or sketch the sunset.\n\nThis option is more probable because it focuses solely on Terence's desire to capture the beauty of the sunset, which is consistent with his character as a naturalist.",

This suggests that he has a strong emotional attachment to the car. Given this, it's more likely that he would want to repair or restore his car simply because he wants to have it back in good condition, rather than specifically so he can drive it again in the spring and summer.",
