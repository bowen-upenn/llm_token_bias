This makes sense because Rick initially didn't think the reward was worth it, so increasing the reward might make him more willing to floss.\n\nOption (b) adds an additional reason for increasing the reward: to avoid further dental issues like gingivitis.

After a few months he was able to easily do ten pull ups.\nWhich is more likely?\n(a) Mark would continue training to increase his pull-up count beyond ten.\n(b) Mark would continue training to increase his pull-up count beyond ten to achieve a new goal of twenty pull-ups.",

Now, we need to decide which option is more likely:\n\n(a) Mark would continue training to increase his pull-up count beyond ten.\n(b) Mark would continue training to increase his pull-up count beyond ten to achieve a new goal of twenty pull-ups.\n\nSince Mark has already achieved his initial goal of doing ten pull-ups, it's likely that he will want to continue challenging himself. Option (a) is a more general statement that doesn't specify a particular new goal, whereas option (b) is more specific and assumes that Mark will set a new goal of twenty pull-ups.\n\nGiven Mark's motivation and progress so far, I think it's more likely that he will continue training to increase his pull-up count beyond ten, but we can't be certain about the specific new goal he'll set. Therefore, I choose:\n\n(a) Mark would continue training to increase his pull-up count beyond ten.",
