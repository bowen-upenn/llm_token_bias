The question asks which is more likely: PSV winning and opening a 6-point gap or PSV winning and opening a 6-point gap because of some psychological bias.\n\nOption (b) adds an unnecessary layer of explanation that is not relevant to the probability of the event.

The only difference is that option (b) adds an additional phrase explaining why Bergen might think that.\n\nIn general, when we're asked to choose between two options that are very similar, the correct answer is usually the more concise one. This is because the added information in option (b) doesn't really change the meaning of the statement, and it's unlikely that the extra phrase would make a significant difference in the likelihood of the statement being true.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, I would choose:\n\n(a) Bergen: Killing was team effort, may not have been connected to bin Laden gun in the room",
