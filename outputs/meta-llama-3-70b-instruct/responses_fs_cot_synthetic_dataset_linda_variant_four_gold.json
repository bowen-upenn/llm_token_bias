Option (b) builds upon option (a) by adding an additional consequence (gaining a significant following).\n\nIn general, when we add more conditions or consequences to an event, the probability of that event occurring decreases.

This seems unlikely, given the opportunity to address modern American politics and share his insights.\n\nOption (b) also starts with the assumption that FDR wouldn't give a speech, but then adds an additional consequence: his presence would increase public interest in historical political decisions and their impacts on today's issues. This consequence is actually quite plausible, considering FDR's significance in American history and the potential curiosity surrounding his resurrection.\n\nHowever, since both options start with the same unlikely assumption (FDR deciding not to give a speech), we should focus on the more fundamental question: would FDR give a speech or not?\n\nGiven the context, it's more likely that FDR would want to share his thoughts and opinions on modern American politics.

During his leadership, he introduced economic reforms that transformed China's economy, but these reforms were still guided by the principles of socialism and state control.\n\nGiven this context, it is more likely that:\n\n(b) He implements a completely free-market system but maintains strong state control over key industries.\n\nThis option is more plausible because it aligns with Teng Hsiao-Ping's historical approach to economic reform, which balanced market-oriented policies with state guidance and control.",
