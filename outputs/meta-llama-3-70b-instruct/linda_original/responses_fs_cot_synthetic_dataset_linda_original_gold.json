This makes option (b) a more specific and restrictive scenario than option (a).\n\nIn general, a more specific scenario is less probable than a more general one. Therefore, I would choose:\n\n(a) Mariana is employed in food preparation and serving related occupations.\n\nThis option is more probable because it's a more general scenario that doesn't require Mariana to have a specific combination of roles or occupations.",

Alex Kaimana enjoys participating in seminars and workshops that focus on the preservation of indigenous knowledge and sustainable practices.\n\nWe know that Alex has a background in environmental science and public policy, and they're interested in sustainable development, social equity, and preserving Pacific cultures. This information doesn't necessarily suggest that Alex is a carpenter.\n\nHowever, option (a) only states that Alex Kaimana is a carpenter, without providing any additional information.
