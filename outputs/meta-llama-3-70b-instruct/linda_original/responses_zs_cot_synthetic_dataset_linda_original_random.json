But if I had to choose, I would say that option (b) is even less probable than option (a) because it adds an additional unrelated hobby that is not mentioned in the description.\n\nSo, my answer is: neither option (a) nor option (b) is probable, but if I had to choose, I would say option (a) is slightly more probable than option (b).",

His skills and passions are more aligned with technology, design, and environmental conservation.\n\nTherefore, I would select neither option (a) nor option (b) as the most probable choice. However, if I had to choose between the two, I would say that option (a) is even less probable than option (b) because it adds an additional activity (urban sketching) that is not mentioned in the passage.\n\nSo, my answer is: neither option (a) nor option (b) is probable, but if I had to choose, I would say option (b) is slightly more probable than option (a).",
