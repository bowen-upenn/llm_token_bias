He also enjoys outdoor activities like hiking and gardening.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n(a) Hiroshi is an architectural and engineering manager.\n\nThis option seems unlikely, as there is no mention of Hiroshi having any background or experience in architecture or engineering. His degree and interests are focused on environmental science.\n\n(b) Hiroshi is an architectural and engineering manager who enjoys exploring photography as a hobby, capturing the beauty of the natural world through his lens.\n\nThis option is even more unlikely than the first one. Not only does it suggest that Hiroshi is an architectural and engineering manager (which doesn't align with his background and interests), but it also adds a hobby that isn't mentioned in the original description.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, neither option seems probable. But if I had to choose, I would say that option (a) is slightly more probable than option (b), simply because it doesn't add an extra layer of unlikely information (the hobby of photography).\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\n\n(a) Hiroshi is an architectural and engineering manager.",
