Aircraft mechanics typically work with machines and technology, which doesn't seem to fit with her environmental science and native studies background.\n\nOption (b) adds an additional detail to option (a), saying she enjoys urban sketching. This doesn't change the fact that being an aircraft mechanic and service technician seems unlikely based on her description.\n\nTherefore, I would say that neither option (a) nor option (b) is particularly probable based on the description of Jennifer Whitefeather. However, if I had to choose, I would say that option (a) is more probable than option (b) simply because it's a more straightforward statement.
