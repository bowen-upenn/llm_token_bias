They completed dual majors in environmental science and public policy at university, showing early their deep commitment to sustainable development and social equity. Alex is known for their resilience and strategic thinking, traits that have greatly influenced their approach to climate advocacy. Outside of their environmental work, they have a keen interest in traditional weaving and are an avid collector of indigenous art, often using their collection to highlight and preserve Pacific cultures. Alex loves exploring the natural world, whether through hiking or underwater photography.\n\nWhich is more probable?\n(a) Alex is a carpenter.\n(b) Alex is a carpenter and enjoys building model airplanes.",

However, option (a) is a more plausible choice because it's possible that Alex's skills and experience in environmental science and public policy could be applied to a career in carpentry, perhaps in a sustainable or eco-friendly context.\n\nOption (b) adds an additional detail about building model airplanes, which seems unrelated to Alex's background and interests.\n\nSo, based on the information, I would choose:\n\n(a) Alex is a carpenter.",

        "question": "Leilani is a 48-year-old Pacific Islander from Hawaii. She holds degrees in marine biology and environmental science from the University of Hawaii. Passionate about ocean conservation, Leilani has dedicated her career to protecting marine ecosystems. She is known for her resilient and compassionate nature, often volunteering for beach clean-ups and community education programs. An avid scuba diver and hiker, Leilani spends most of her free time exploring the natural beauty of her island home. She also enjoys sharing her love for Hawaiian culture and traditions through local workshops and festivals.\n\nWhich is more probable?\n(a) Leilani is a control and valve installer and repairer, except mechanical door, and paints watercolor landscapes.\n(b) Leilani is a control and valve installer and repairer, except mechanical door.",

She's dedicated her career to protecting marine ecosystems and spends her free time exploring the natural beauty of her island home.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n(a) Leilani is a control and valve installer and repairer, except mechanical door, and paints watercolor landscapes.\n(b) Leilani is a control and valve installer and repairer, except mechanical door.\n\nBased on Leilani's background and interests, it's unlikely that she would be a control and valve installer and repairer, except mechanical door. This occupation doesn't seem to align with her education, passion, and career dedication to ocean conservation.\n\nTherefore, I would select option (b) as the less probable option, since it's still possible that Leilani might have a secondary hobby or talent unrelated to her main career. However, it's even less likely that she would have this specific occupation.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n(b) Leilani is a control and valve installer and repairer, except mechanical door.",
