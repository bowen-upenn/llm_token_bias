This is a simple statement that doesn't provide any additional information.\n\nStatement (b) says the movie wins no awards (which is the same as statement (a)) and also becomes a box office hit. This adds an additional condition to the original statement.\n\nHere's the key insight: when we add more conditions to an event, the probability of that event occurring typically decreases. In this case, the probability of the movie winning no awards is already established in statement (a). By adding the condition \"becomes a box office hit\" in statement (b), we are making the event more specific and less likely to occur.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that:\n\nThe correct answer is (a) The movie wins no awards.\n\nAm I correct?",
