To calculate the probability of this sequence, we need to multiply the probabilities of each individual spin:\nP(EELELL) = (5/8) \u00d7 (5/8) \u00d7 (5/8) \u00d7 (3/8) \u00d7 (3/8) \u00d7 (5/8)\n\n(b) EEELL: This sequence consists of 4 Es and 1 L.

In particular, sequences with more Es have higher probabilities because Es are more likely than Ls.\n\nComparing the sequences, we can see that option (b) EEELL has the highest probability, since it has one more E than the other two options.\n\nTherefore, I choose option **(b) EEELL**.",

The probability of getting 6 magentas in a row is (3/8)^6, and the probability of getting 1 green is (5/8)^1.
