From premise 2, we know that some dairy products are high in calcium. However, we cannot conclude that any of those dairy products that are high in calcium are necessarily butters. They could be other types of dairy products.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: No, this argument is not logically sound.",

However, the premises don't provide explicit justification for this assumption.\n\nThe problem is that the second premise only tells us about some horses being fast runners, but it doesn't specifically link foals to that subset.

Since shorts are a part of clothing, it's possible that some of the clothing items that shrink when washed are indeed shorts.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, and the answer is: Yes, this argument is logically sound.",
