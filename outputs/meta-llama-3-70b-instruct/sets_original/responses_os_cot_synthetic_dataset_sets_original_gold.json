Therefore, some caps are waterproof.\n\nThe conclusion is trying to link the two premises together. Since all caps are headwear, and some headwear is waterproof, it's possible that some of those waterproof headwear items are also caps. However, we can't be 100% certain that some caps are waterproof just based on these two premises.\n\nFor example, it's possible that all the waterproof headwear items are hats, and none of the caps are waterproof. We can't rule out this possibility with the given information.\n\nSo, the answer is: No, this is not logically sound.",
