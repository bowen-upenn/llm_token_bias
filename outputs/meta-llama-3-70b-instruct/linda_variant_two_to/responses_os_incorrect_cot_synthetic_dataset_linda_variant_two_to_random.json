Secretary-General, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, and the U.N. calling for the elimination of greenhouse gas emissions by 2100. This suggests that the context is related to climate change and environmental issues.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n(a) IPCC says it is more certain than ever that humans are causing temperature rises\n(b) IPCC says it is more certain than ever that humans are causing temperature rises to increase local tourism in coastal areas.\n\nOption (a) is a plausible statement, as the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) is a scientific body that studies climate change, and it's likely that they would be discussing the certainty of human-caused temperature rises.\n\nOption (b) seems less likely, as increasing local tourism in coastal areas is not a direct consequence of human-caused temperature rises. In fact, rising temperatures and climate change are often associated with negative impacts on coastal areas, such as sea-level rise and more frequent natural disasters.\n\nTherefore, based on the context and the content of the options, I choose:\n\n(a) IPCC says it is more certain than ever that humans are causing temperature rises",

This suggests that the zoo is transparent about their actions and is willing to educate the public about their decisions.\n\nNow, considering the options:\n\n(a) Giraffe's carcass was fed to zoo's carnivores\n(b) Giraffe's carcass was fed to zoo's carnivores to celebrate the zookeeper's birthday\n\nOption (b) seems unlikely because there is no mention of the zookeeper's birthday or any celebratory event. It's also unusual for a zoo to use an animal's carcass as a way to celebrate a birthday.\n\nOn the other hand, option (a) is a common practice in zoos, where the carcass of an animal is used as food for other animals, such as carnivores. This is a natural and practical way to handle the remains of an animal that has been euthanized.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Giraffe's carcass was fed to zoo's carnivores",

This action would likely be seen as disrespectful and inflammatory, and the Prime Minister would likely want to distance himself from it.",
