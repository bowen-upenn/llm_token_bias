Not only did the plane fly into Swedish airspace without permission, but it also sent an emergency signal requesting assistance from nearby NATO forces.

This is a straightforward statement about the outcome of the event.\n\nOption (b) adds an additional detail to option (a), stating that the survivors celebrated a miraculous escape together later that evening.\n\nSince option (b) includes all the information in option (a) plus an additional detail, it is less likely to occur than option (a). In other words, it's more likely that all passengers and crew members survived the landing (option a) than it is that they not only survived but also celebrated together later that evening (option b).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) All 155 passengers and crew members on board survived the landing",

This statement is a neutral, factual claim.\n\n(b) adds an additional claim about the Democrats being hesitant to support Obama due to his policies. This adds an extra layer of information that is not necessarily implied by the first statement.\n\nSince (a) is a more general and neutral statement, it is more likely to be true than (b), which makes an additional claim about the Democrats' opinions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Florida has 650,000 Jews, many of them Democrats",

It specifies that these 3,538 planet candidates have at least one potentially habitable planet. This is a more specific and restrictive condition.\n\nIn general, a more general statement is more likely to be true than a more specific statement.
