The question asks which is more likely:\n\n(a) -Israeli ties\n(b) -Israeli ties to celebrate Thanksgiving together.\n\nConsidering the context of the passage, option (a) -Israeli ties refers to the diplomatic relationship or bond between the US and Israel, which is a plausible and relevant topic given the quotes from Netanyahu and Hillary Clinton.\n\nOption (b) -Israeli ties to celebrate Thanksgiving together, on the other hand, seems out of place. There is no indication in the passage that the US and Israel, or their representatives, would be celebrating Thanksgiving together. Thanksgiving is a uniquely American holiday, and it's unlikely that the passage is referring to a joint celebration.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) -Israeli ties",
