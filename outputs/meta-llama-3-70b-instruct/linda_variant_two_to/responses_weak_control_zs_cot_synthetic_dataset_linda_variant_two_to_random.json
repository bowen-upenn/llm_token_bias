This is a plausible and coherent statement, as roll stability control is a safety feature that can help prevent rollovers, and it's reasonable to expect governments to regulate such safety features.\n\nOption (b) adds an additional clause to option (a), stating that this regulation will be discussed at the next international space station mission conference. This is where things get unlikely. The international space station mission conference is an unrelated event that deals with space exploration, not car safety regulations. It's highly unlikely that a government regulation about car safety would be discussed at such a conference.\n\nGiven this analysis, I conclude that option (a) is more likely than option (b).\n\nSo, my answer is:\n\n(a) RSC: roll stability control, new government regulation to prevent rollovers",
