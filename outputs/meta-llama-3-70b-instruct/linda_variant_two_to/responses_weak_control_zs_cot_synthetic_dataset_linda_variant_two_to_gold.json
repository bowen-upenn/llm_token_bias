We know that Florida has 650,000 Jews, and many of them are Democrats. This is a basic statement of fact.\n2. Now, we're asked to choose between two options:\n   (a) Florida has 650,000 Jews, many of them Democrats\n   (b) Florida has 650,000 Jews, many of them Democrats to be hesitant in supporting Obama due to his policies.\n\nThe key insight here is that option (b) is a more specific and restrictive statement than option (a). It adds an additional condition (being hesitant to support Obama due to his policies) to the original statement.\n\nUsing probability theory, we know that the probability of two events occurring together (the conjunction) is always less than or equal to the probability of either event occurring alone. In this case, the probability of \"Florida has 650,000 Jews, many of them Democrats\" is higher than the probability of \"Florida has 650,000 Jews, many of them Democrats to be hesitant in supporting Obama due to his policies\".\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Florida has 650,000 Jews, many of them Democrats",

This means that the probability of a planet being potentially habitable is 22%.\n\nNow, let's consider the two options:\n\n(a) Kepler has found 3,538 planet candidates to date.\n(b) Kepler has found 3,538 planet candidates to date to have at least one potentially habitable planet.\n\nOption (a) simply states that Kepler has found 3,538 planet candidates. This is a straightforward statement about the number of planet candidates found.\n\nOption (b) adds an additional condition to option (a), stating that these 3,538 planet candidates have at least one potentially habitable planet. This is a more specific and restrictive condition.\n\nSince option (b) is a more specific and restrictive condition, it is less likely to occur than option (a). In other words, it is more likely that Kepler has found 3,538 planet candidates (option a) than it is that all of these planet candidates have at least one potentially habitable planet (option b).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Kepler has found 3,538 planet candidates to date.",
