The report is referred to as \"another canary in the coal mine,\" implying that it's a warning signal about a serious problem.\n\nThe U.N. is calling for the elimination of greenhouse gas emissions by 2100, which is a strong indication that the report is related to climate change.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n(a) IPCC says it is more certain than ever that humans are causing temperature rises\n(b) IPCC says it is more certain than ever that humans are causing temperature rises to reach critical levels threatening global food security and causing severe weather patterns.\n\nBoth options mention the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) and humans causing temperature rises, which is consistent with the context of the text.\n\nHowever, option (b) adds more specific details about the consequences of temperature rises, such as threatening global food security and causing severe weather patterns. While this is a plausible scenario, it's not directly implied in the original text.\n\nOn the other hand, option (a) is a more straightforward statement that aligns with the tone and content of the original text. The IPCC is a credible source that has consistently emphasized the human role in climate change, and the text's mention of the U.N. report and the need to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions suggests a high level of certainty about human-caused temperature rises.\n\nTherefore, I choose option (a) as the more likely statement.",

We also know that he made a statement saying \"We are just all devastated\".\n\nNow, considering the two options:\n\n(a) \"We are just all devastated,\" says her father, Mickey Harte\n(b) \"We are just all devastated,\" says her father, Mickey Harte to a group of reporters after hearing the news.\n\nOption (a) simply states that Mickey Harte said \"We are just all devastated\", without providing any context.\n\nOption (b) adds more context to the statement, specifying that Mickey Harte said this to a group of reporters after hearing the news.\n\nGiven the situation, it's more likely that Mickey Harte would make a statement to reporters about his daughter's death, rather than just saying it in isolation.\n\nTherefore, I choose option (b) as the more likely scenario.",
