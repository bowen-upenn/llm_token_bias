The passage mentions that Ambassador Susan Rice says the cease-fire is not holding, and there are reports of at least 70 people found dead in Syria. This suggests that the situation in Syria is violent and unstable.\n\nA sanctions group is likely to deplore sales of arms to Syria because they would want to prevent further violence and instability. The reason for their condemnation is not specified in the passage, but it's reasonable to assume that they would oppose arms sales due to the ongoing conflict.\n\nOption (a) simply states that a sanctions group deplores sales of arms to Syria, without specifying a reason. This is a more general and plausible statement.\n\nOption (b) adds the specific reason that the sanctions group deplores arms sales \"to support the regime.\" While this could be a possible reason, it's not explicitly mentioned in the passage, and we can't assume that's the only reason or even the primary reason for their condemnation.\n\nTherefore, based on the context and the information provided, I select:\n\n(a) A sanctions group deplores sales of arms to Syria",

We need to compare the two options and choose the one that is more probable or requires fewer assumptions.\n\nOption (a) states that games taking advantage of screen size will include Vainglory, Asphalt 8.\n\nOption (b) states that games taking advantage of screen size will include Vainglory, Asphalt 8 to feature exclusive gameplay enhancements.\n\nThe key difference between the two options is the additional phrase \"to feature exclusive gameplay enhancements\" in option (b).\n\nSince we don't have any information about whether these games will have exclusive gameplay enhancements or not, it's safer to assume that they will simply take advantage of the screen size without any additional features.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Games taking advantage of screen size will include Vainglory, Asphalt 8.",

Option (a) simply states that the funeral company has stringent security patrols, which is a general fact about the company's security measures. Option (b) adds a specific reason for the security patrols, which is to keep fans from visiting Michael Jackson's specific grave site.\n\nIn this case, option (a) is more likely because it's a more general statement that doesn't provide additional information about the purpose of the security patrols. It's possible that the funeral company has stringent security patrols for various reasons, not just to protect Michael Jackson's grave site.\n\nSo, my answer is:\n\n(a) Funeral company has stringent security patrols",
