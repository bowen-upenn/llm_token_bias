In other words, the probability of (b) is the probability of (a) multiplied by the probability of \"significantly strengthens their domestic support\" given that (a) is true.\n\nSince the probability of (a) is already low, multiplying it by another low probability makes the overall probability of (b) even lower.\n\nTherefore, I choose:\n\n(a) The event receives no international media coverage.\n\nThis option is more likely because it only depends on a single event, whereas option (b) requires two unlikely events to occur simultaneously.",

The probability of a conjunction (two events occurring together) is typically lower than or equal to the probability of each individual event.\n\nConsidering this, I would choose option (a): He struggles to understand contemporary geopolitics.\n\nThe reason is that option (b) is a more specific and restrictive scenario, requiring not only that Marshall struggles to understand contemporary geopolitics but also that he achieves a significant success in brokering an international agreement.
