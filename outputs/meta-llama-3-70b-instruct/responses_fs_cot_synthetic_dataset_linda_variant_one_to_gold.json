She gave him some pills to help him feel better.\n\nNow, we need to decide which option is more likely:\n\n(a) Gregory would take the pills given by Doctor Gemma.\n(b) Gregory would take the pills given by Doctor Gemma to feel better soon.\n\nIt seems that both options are related to Gregory taking the pills, but option (b) adds an extra detail - \"to feel better soon\". However, this extra detail is already implied in the context of the story. Gregory went to the doctor because he was feeling ill, and the doctor gave him pills to make him feel better. So, it's reasonable to assume that Gregory would take the pills to achieve that goal.\n\nGiven this, I would choose option (a) as the more likely answer:\n\n(a) Gregory would take the pills given by Doctor Gemma.\n\nThe added detail in option (b) doesn't change the likelihood of Gregory taking the pills, so we can stick with the simpler option (a).",
