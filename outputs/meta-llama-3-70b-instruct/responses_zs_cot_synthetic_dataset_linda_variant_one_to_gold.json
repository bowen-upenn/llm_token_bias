This behavior is repeated \"day after day\".\n\nFrom this information, we can infer that the protagonist has a habit of giving in to temptation and eating junk food despite their initial intentions to eat healthily.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n(a) The protagonist would continue eating junk food.\n(b) The protagonist would continue eating junk food to gain comfort from their stressful day at work.\n\nOption (b) introduces a new factor - stress at work - which is not mentioned in the original passage. We don't have any information about the protagonist's work life or whether they're using junk food as a coping mechanism for stress.\n\nOn the other hand, option (a) is a straightforward continuation of the behavior described in the passage. Given the pattern of behavior established, it's likely that the protagonist will continue eating junk food.\n\nTherefore, I select option (a) as the more likely outcome.",

He got a job to earn the money, but he quit because of the stress. Despite quitting, he still thought about getting a new computer.\n\nNow, considering his situation, it's likely that Ray will look for ways to achieve his goal of buying a new computer. Given that he didn't enjoy the stress of his previous job, it's probable that he'll explore alternative options that are less stressful.\n\nHowever, there's no mention of Ray needing a powerful gaming setup. The original goal was simply to buy a new computer. Therefore, option (b) adds an unnecessary assumption.\n\nSo, I choose:\n\n(a) Ray might start looking for a less stressful job or explore alternative ways to earn or save money for the computer.",
