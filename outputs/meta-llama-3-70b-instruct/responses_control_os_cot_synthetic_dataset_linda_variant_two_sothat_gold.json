We're asked to determine which option is more likely:\n\n(a) Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel took the checkered flag at his home grand prix\n(b) Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel took the checkered flag at his home grand prix so that he could dedicate his victory to the injured cameraman, Paul Allen.\n\nUsing probabilistic thinking, we can see that option (b) is a conjunction of two events: \n\n1. Sebastian Vettel taking the checkered flag at his home grand prix\n2. He did so to dedicate his victory to the injured cameraman, Paul Allen\n\nThe probability of this conjunction (option b) is always less than or equal to the probability of its constituents. In this case, the probability of Sebastian Vettel taking the checkered flag at his home grand prix (option a) is higher than the probability of him doing so specifically to dedicate his victory to the injured cameraman.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel took the checkered flag at his home grand prix",
