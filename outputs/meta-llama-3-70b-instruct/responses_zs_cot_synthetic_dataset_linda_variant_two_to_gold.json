Hillary Clinton says the US commitment to Israel is \"unwavering, enduring and forever\".\n3. The US will also continue to rebuke Israel when necessary.\n4. Construction plans in East Jerusalem have strained US-Israeli ties.\n\nNow, considering these points, we need to decide which option is more likely:\n\n(a) -Israeli ties\n(b) -Israeli ties to be negatively affected by the ongoing disagreements over construction plans.\n\nGiven that the construction plans have already strained US-Israeli ties (point 4), and there is no indication of a resolution or compromise, it is more likely that the disagreements will continue to affect the ties negatively.\n\nTherefore, I choose:\n\n(b) -Israeli ties to be negatively affected by the ongoing disagreements over construction plans.",

        "init_model_answer": "Let's break it down.\n\nThe passage mentions that iPhone 6 and 6 Plus offer bigger screens and new features. It's likely that games will be developed to take advantage of these new features, especially the larger screen size.\n\nOption (a) simply states that games like Vainglory and Asphalt 8 will take advantage of the screen size, which is a reasonable assumption given the context.\n\nOption (b) adds an extra detail, stating that these games will not only take advantage of the screen size but also feature exclusive gameplay enhancements. This is a more specific and stronger claim than option (a).\n\nGiven that the passage only mentions bigger screens and new features, but doesn't provide any information about exclusive gameplay enhancements, I think option (a) is more likely.\n\nSo, my answer is: (a) Games taking advantage of screen size will include Vainglory, Asphalt 8.",

This suggests that the funeral company (Forest Lawn Memorial Park) is trying to keep the location of Michael Jackson's grave private.\n\nGiven this context, I think the more likely option is:\n\n(b) Funeral company has stringent security patrol to keep fans from visiting Michael Jackson's specific grave site.\n\nThis makes sense because the funeral company is trying to maintain secrecy around the location of Michael Jackson's grave, and having a security patrol specifically to prevent fans from visiting his grave would be a logical measure to take.",

It's likely that he would be emotional and devastated by the news of his daughter's death.\n\nGiven that the passage mentions \"Mauritius police\" and provides information about the incident, it's probable that Mickey Harte is speaking to a group of reporters or journalists who are seeking a statement or reaction from him.\n\nTherefore, I select option (b) as the more likely scenario:\n\n(b) \"We are just all devastated,\" says her father, Mickey Harte to a group of reporters after hearing the news.",
