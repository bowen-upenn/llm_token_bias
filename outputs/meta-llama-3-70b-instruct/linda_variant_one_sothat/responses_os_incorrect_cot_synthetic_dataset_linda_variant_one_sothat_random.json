Ralph pretended to be surprised to avoid upsetting their parents.\n3. Ralph took Georgia out to a movie to thank her for warning him.\n\nNow, let's consider the options:\n\n(a) Georgia would likely accept Ralph's invitation to the movie.\n(b) Georgia would likely accept Ralph's invitation to the movie so that she could hear the movie's soundtrack, which she had read was excellent.\n\nBased on the story, we can infer that Georgia and Ralph have a good relationship, and Georgia helped Ralph out by warning him about the surprise party. It's likely that Georgia would accept Ralph's invitation to the movie as a way to spend time with her brother and enjoy his company, rather than specifically for the movie's soundtrack.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Georgia would likely accept Ralph's invitation to the movie.",

So I traded with her.\n\nFrom the information, we know:\n\n* The protagonist's friend is smaller than the protagonist.\n* The protagonist traded their shirt with their friend.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n(a) The protagonist would likely wear a shirt that is too large for them.\n(b) The protagonist would likely wear a shirt that is too large for them so that they could enjoy the concert more comfortably.\n\nConsidering the scenario, it's clear that the protagonist traded their shirt with their friend, who is smaller. This means the protagonist would end up with a smaller shirt (their friend's shirt), not a larger one. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nNeither (a) nor (b) is correct. The protagonist would likely wear a shirt that is too small for them, not too large.",

As a naturalist, Terence might want to capture the beauty of the sunset to appreciate it later, share it with others, or use it as a reference for his own observations.\n\nOption (b) seems less likely. While it's possible that Terence might be interested in knitting, there's no indication in the passage that he's interested in knitting or that he would want to use the image of the sunset as a reference for a sweater.
