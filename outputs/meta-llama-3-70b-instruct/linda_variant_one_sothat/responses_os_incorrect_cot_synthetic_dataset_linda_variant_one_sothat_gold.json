Therefore, the more likely option is:\n\n(a) The protagonist, the vine, would likely continue to climb another nearby tree.\n\nThe vine's behavior in the past (strangling the tree) doesn't necessarily mean it will continue to do so in the future.

Vowed to never go on one again.\n\nConsidering these points, it's clear that Lilly had a very negative experience with the roller coaster. She was already afraid of heights and fast movement, and the ride only reinforced those fears. She even got physically ill afterwards.\n\nGiven this, it's more likely that Lilly would avoid roller coasters in the future because of the unpleasant feelings and physical discomfort she experienced. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(b) Lilly would avoid roller coasters in the future so that she would not feel nauseous and scared again.",

Cara might feel sorry for what she did and want to make amends.\n\n(b) Cara might apologize to her parents for sneaking out so that they might consider reducing her grounding period.\n\nThis option is more specific and takes into account the consequences of Cara's actions. She might apologize not just because she's sorry, but also because she wants to try to get out of the punishment or reduce its severity.\n\nGiven the situation, I think option (b) is more likely. Cara is probably motivated to apologize because she wants to try to get her parents to reconsider the two-month grounding. She might be thinking, \"If I apologize and show remorse, maybe they'll take it easy on me and reduce the punishment.\"\n\nSo, my answer is: (b) Cara might apologize to her parents for sneaking out so that they might consider reducing her grounding period.",
