The protagonist's friend wanted to trade with them, and the friend is smaller than the protagonist.\n\nIf the protagonist trades with their friend, it means the protagonist will give their shirt to the friend, and the friend will give their shirt to the protagonist.\n\nSince the friend is smaller than the protagonist, the shirt the friend has (which is a large) will likely be too small for the protagonist. But the protagonist's shirt (also a large) will likely fit the friend because the friend is smaller.\n\nSo, in this scenario, it's more likely that:\n\n(b) The protagonist would likely wear a shirt that is too small for them.\n\nAm I correct?",

He notices the weather's influence on nature's beauty, and he's particularly interested in the sunset after a big rain.\n\nGiven his interest in nature and beauty, it's likely that Terence would want to capture the moment in some way.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Terence would likely photograph or sketch the sunset.\n\nThis option is more likely because it simply states that Terence would want to capture the moment, which is a natural response for someone who appreciates beauty and nature.

This is a plausible scenario, as newlyweds often celebrate their anniversary and may want to organize family gatherings to spend time with their loved ones.\n\nOption (b) adds an additional detail, stating that the purpose of the family gathering is to introduce their new baby to the extended family. However, there is no mention of a baby in the original passage. While it's possible that they might have a baby in the future, it's not explicitly stated.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, I would choose option (a) as the more likely scenario.
