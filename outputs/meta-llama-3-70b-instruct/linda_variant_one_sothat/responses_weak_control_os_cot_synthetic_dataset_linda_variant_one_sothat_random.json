Katherine loved coffee and received a Starbucks Gift Certificate.\n2. She went through the drive-through the next day.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(a) Katherine would buy coffee at Starbucks using the gift certificate.\n(b) Katherine would buy coffee at Starbucks using the gift certificate so that she could watch the season finale of her favorite TV show later that evening.\n\nOption (a) is a simple, straightforward statement about Katherine using the gift certificate to buy coffee at Starbucks. This is a highly probable event, given the context.\n\nOption (b) adds an additional condition: Katherine would buy coffee at Starbucks using the gift certificate, and then she would watch the season finale of her favorite TV show later that evening. This is a conjunction of two events.\n\nThe key insight here is that the probability of the conjunction (b) cannot be higher than the probability of the individual event (a). In other words, the probability of Katherine buying coffee at Starbucks using the gift certificate is higher than the probability of her doing so specifically to watch the season finale of her favorite TV show later that evening.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Katherine would buy coffee at Starbucks using the gift certificate.",

As a naturalist, Terence might want to capture the beauty of the sunset for personal or professional reasons.\n\nOption (b) is a more specific and complex statement. While it's possible that Terence might want to knit a sweater inspired by the sunset, this is a more unlikely scenario. The added detail about knitting a sweater makes the statement more restrictive and less probable.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that:\n\n(a) Terence would likely photograph or sketch the sunset.\n\nis the more probable option.",

This is a separate event that is not directly related to the dinner scenario.\n\nSince statement (b) is a conjunction of two events, it is less likely to occur than statement (a), which only describes a single event.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Tom would feel relieved and enjoy the dinner.\n\nThe conjunction fallacy would lead us to think that (b) is more likely because it provides more detail, but in reality, it's less likely due to the additional condition.",
