The added information is not providing any new or contradictory information that would make option (b) more or less likely than option (a).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) The protagonist would likely look for other job opportunities.\n\nBy selecting option (a), we are not denying the possibility that the protagonist wants to improve their chances of getting hired despite scheduling issues.

This suggests that Jasper enjoys spending time with his dog and values their relationship.\n\nOption (a) states that Jasper would play fetch with his dog. This is a common activity that many dog owners enjoy with their pets, and it's consistent with Jasper's desire to spend time with his dog.\n\nOption (b) adds an additional detail, stating that Jasper would play fetch with his dog so that he could teach it new tricks. While it's possible that Jasper might want to teach his dog new tricks, this adds an extra layer of complexity to the scenario.\n\nGiven the information provided, it's more likely that Jasper would simply play fetch with his dog because he enjoys the activity, rather than having a specific goal in mind (teaching new tricks).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Jasper would play fetch with his dog.",
