She's already seen the positive results, so it's likely she'll continue with the diet.\n\nOption (b) introduces a new, unrelated activity (collecting rare stamps) that doesn't seem to be connected to Jane's diet or her goals. It's unlikely that Jane would continue the diet specifically to start collecting stamps.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n(a) Jane would continue following her low-calorie diet.",

The correct answer would be \"The protagonist would likely wear a shirt that fits them.\" But since that's not an option, I'll choose the one that is less likely to be true: (b) The protagonist would likely wear a shirt that is too large for them so that they could enjoy the concert more comfortably.",

Both options (a) and (b) suggest that he might do so through a creative medium.\n\nHowever, option (b) adds an additional layer of complexity, suggesting that Terence would not only capture the sunset but also use it as a reference to knit a sweater. While it's possible that Terence might be interested in knitting, there's no prior indication of this in the passage.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, I think it's more likely that Terence would simply want to capture the beauty of the sunset through photography or sketching, without any additional motivation.\n\nSo, my answer is: (a) Terence would likely photograph or sketch the sunset.",

This is a more straightforward and plausible scenario.\n\nThe second option, (b), adds an additional layer of complexity by introducing someone who doesn't even know about the accident.
