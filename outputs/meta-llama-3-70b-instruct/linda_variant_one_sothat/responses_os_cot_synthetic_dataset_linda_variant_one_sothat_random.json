The protagonist's friend wanted to trade with them, and the friend is smaller than the protagonist.\n\nFrom this, we can infer that:\n\n* The protagonist has a large shirt (since that's all that was left).\n* The friend is smaller than the protagonist, so the friend would fit into the protagonist's large shirt.\n* The protagonist is trading with their friend, which means they're giving their large shirt to their friend.\n\nNow, the question asks which is more likely:\n\n(a) The protagonist would likely wear a shirt that is too large for them.\n(b) The protagonist would likely wear a shirt that is too large for them so that they could enjoy the concert more comfortably.\n\nConsidering the scenario, it's clear that the protagonist is trading their large shirt with their friend, which means the protagonist will now have a shirt that fits them (since their friend is smaller). Therefore, it's unlikely that the protagonist would wear a shirt that is too large for them.\n\nSo, the correct answer is neither (a) nor (b). The scenario suggests that the protagonist will not wear a shirt that is too large for them.\n\nHowever, if I had to choose between the two options, I would select (a) as the less unlikely option, since it's possible that the protagonist might end up with a shirt that's slightly too large, even if it's not extremely so.
