This is a single event.\n\nOption (b) states that Kim would likely prepare for the arrival of her baby so that she could decorate the nursery based on the baby's gender. This is a conjunction of two events: preparing for the baby's arrival and decorating the nursery based on the baby's gender.\n\nAccording to the basic probability rule, the probability of a conjunction (P(A and B)) is always less than or equal to the probabilities of its constituents (P(A) or P(B)).\n\nTherefore, I'll choose the option involving a single event, which statistically holds a higher likelihood than the conjunction of multiple events.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n(a) Kim would likely prepare for the arrival of her baby.",
