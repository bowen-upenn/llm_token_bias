This scenario is also unlikely, but slightly more plausible than option (a). The Rolling Stones are known for their high-energy live performances, and their tours often attract large crowds.

So, this option seems plausible.\n\nNow, let's consider option (b): \"The album receives mixed reviews but includes at least one top 10 single.\" This option builds upon the first one, adding an additional condition: the album must include a top 10 single.

In fact, many albums with mixed reviews still produce successful singles.

Critics and audiences alike would likely be excited to see what he has to offer after a hiatus.\n\nHowever, it's possible that some critics might not find the special as funny or innovative as his previous work, which could lead to some negative reviews.\n\nNow, considering the second part of the question: if the special does receive poor reviews, it's still likely to break viewership records on the streaming platform. Why? Because Jerry Seinfeld is a household name, and many people would tune in out of curiosity or nostalgia alone.\n\nSo, taking all this into account, I'm going to choose:\n\n(b) The special receives poor reviews but breaks viewership records on the streaming platform.\n\nThis option seems more plausible, as even if the special doesn't quite live up to expectations, Seinfeld's fame and fan base would still drive significant viewership.",

Although he faced challenges in improving Germany's international relations, especially with regards to its occupation by the Allied powers, he made significant progress in this area.\n\nHowever, Adenauer's primary focus was on rebuilding and revitalizing Germany's economy, which had been devastated by the war. He implemented policies that encouraged economic growth, such as the social market economy, and worked closely with Ludwig Erhard, his Minister of Economics, to implement reforms. These efforts led to the \"Wirtschaftswunder\" (Economic Miracle), which saw Germany's economy experience rapid growth and recovery.\n\nGiven Adenauer's priorities and achievements, it's more likely that he would have succeeded in reviving the domestic economy while facing challenges in improving international relations.",

The Cold War was a period of high tension and ideological rivalry between the two superpowers, and Andropov was a key figure in the Soviet Union's communist regime.\n\nHowever, if we assume that Andropov did take a diplomatic trip to the United States and made an effort to build bridges with American politicians, it's possible that he might have been able to establish some level of rapport with them.\n\nBut, considering the deep-seated differences between the USSR and USA during the Cold War, it's highly unlikely that Andropov's diplomatic efforts would be enough to completely ease the tension between the two nations.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, I would select option (b): He becomes a favorite among American politicians but fails to ease the tension between the USSR and USA.",

Let's say there's a 10-20% chance of the movie receiving an Oscar nomination.\n\nNow, let's consider the box office performance. Romantic comedies can do well at the box office, especially if they have a big star like Dwayne Johnson attached. $500 million worldwide is a significant amount, but it's achievable for a well-made and well-marketed rom-com with a popular lead. Let's say there's a 30-40% chance of the movie making over $500 million worldwide.\n\nNow, let's combine these two possibilities. For the movie to receive an Oscar nomination AND make over $500 million worldwide, both conditions need to be met.

He and his wife, Soong Mei-ling (also known as Mme Chiang Kai-Shek), were prominent figures in Chinese politics during that time.\n\nHowever, here's the catch: Chiang Kai-Shek passed away in 1975, and Mme Chiang Kai-Shek passed away in 2003. Therefore, it is not possible for them to host a diplomatic event today.\n\nGiven this, I would say that neither option (a) nor option (b) is likely, since the event cannot even take place. But if I had to choose, I would select:\n\n(a) The event receives no international media coverage.\n\nThis is because, as mentioned earlier, the event cannot happen in the first place, so it's impossible for it to receive any media coverage, international or otherwise.",

While he was an exceptional leader, it's essential to consider the significant changes that have occurred in global politics since his time.\n\nGiven the rapid evolution of international relations, technological advancements, and shifting global power dynamics, I think it's likely that Marshall would initially struggle to understand contemporary geopolitics. The world has changed dramatically since his era, with new actors, interests, and complexities emerging on the global stage.\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\n\n(a) He struggles to understand contemporary geopolitics.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that Marshall was a highly adaptable and intelligent individual who demonstrated exceptional diplomatic skills throughout his career. If given the opportunity to learn and adapt, he might eventually be able to navigate modern geopolitics and potentially broker a groundbreaking international agreement.\n\nBut based on the initial scenario, I believe option (a) is the more likely outcome.",
