This additional detail seems unrelated to the diagnosis.\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is:\n\n(b) Morgan also experiences vomiting.\n\nThis option is more probable because it's a common symptom of hepatitis A, whereas the additional detail in option (a) is unrelated and doesn't increase the likelihood.",
