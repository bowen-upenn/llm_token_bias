Some people may experience hunger or food cravings before or during a migraine episode, possibly due to changes in serotonin levels or other neurotransmitters. However, there is no direct causal link between migraines and excessive hunger.\n\nOn the other hand, acidity, or acid reflux, is not a typical symptom directly related to migraines.
