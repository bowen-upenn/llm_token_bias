Ricardo has Hypothyroidism, which can cause cold hands and feet. So, option (a) \"He experiences cold hands and feet\" is a reasonable symptom of his condition.\n\n2. Now, let's consider option (b) \"He experiences cold hands and feet and acute sensitivity to noise\". This option includes everything in option (a) plus an additional symptom, acute sensitivity to noise.\n\n3. Since option (b) is a conjunction of two symptoms, it's less likely to occur than option (a), which only requires one symptom.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) He experiences cold hands and feet.\n\nThis is because it's more likely for Ricardo to experience cold hands and feet (a symptom of Hypothyroidism) than to experience both cold hands and feet and acute sensitivity to noise (a combination of two symptoms).",

The conjunction of these two events makes option (a) less likely than option (b), which only includes the likely event (dehydration).",
