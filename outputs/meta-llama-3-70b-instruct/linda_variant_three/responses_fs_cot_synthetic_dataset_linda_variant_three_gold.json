While it's possible, it's not a typical or common outcome.\n\nGiven the information, it's more likely that the man will experience yellowish skin as a symptom of Hepatitis E, but it's less likely that he will also experience a coma.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) He experiences yellowish skin.",
