Sunken eyes can also be a symptom of dehydration.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n(a) Morgan also experiences dehydration and sunken eyes.\n(b) Morgan also experiences dehydration.\n\nSince dehydration is a common symptom of Gastroenteritis, it's likely that Morgan experiences dehydration (option b).\n\nThe addition of \"sunken eyes\" in option (a) is also a possible symptom of dehydration, but it's an additional condition that may or may not occur.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that option (b) \"Morgan also experiences dehydration\" is more likely.\n\nMy answer is: (b) Morgan also experiences dehydration.",
