It adds an additional symptom, altered sensorium, to vomiting. Altered sensorium is also a possible symptom of brain hemorrhage, but it's not as directly related to vomiting as it is to the brain hemorrhage itself.\n\nGiven that both options include vomiting, which is a likely symptom, the more likely option is the one that is more specific and has a higher probability of occurring together with paralysis due to brain hemorrhage.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n(b) Alex also experiences vomiting.",
