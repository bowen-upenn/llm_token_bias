This is supported by option (b).\n\nHowever, option (a) adds an additional symptom, \"lack of concentration\", which may not be a direct symptom of hypertension. While it's possible that she may experience lack of concentration, it's not as directly related to hypertension as a headache is.\n\nTherefore, based on the information, I would choose:\n\n(b) She experiences a headache.\n\nThis option is more likely because it's a more direct symptom of hypertension.",
