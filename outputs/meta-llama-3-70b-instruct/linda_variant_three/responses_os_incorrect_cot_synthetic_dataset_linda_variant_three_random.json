Paralysis is a common symptom of brain hemorrhage, and it can cause weakness or numbness in different parts of the body, depending on the location and severity of the hemorrhage.\n\nWeakness of one body side (hemiparesis) is a common symptom of brain hemorrhage, especially if the hemorrhage occurs in a specific area of the brain that controls motor function.\n\nExcessive sneezing is not a typical symptom of brain hemorrhage or paralysis. While it's possible that Tane may experience sneezing due to some other unrelated condition, it's not directly related to his brain hemorrhage or paralysis.\n\nGiven this information, I would select option (b) He experiences weakness of one body side.\n\nThe correct answer is (b) He experiences weakness of one body side.",
