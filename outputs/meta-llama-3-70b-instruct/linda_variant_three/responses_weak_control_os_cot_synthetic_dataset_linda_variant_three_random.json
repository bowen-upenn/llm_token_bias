Chicken pox is a viral infection that typically causes a skin rash.\n3. Given the diagnosis, it is highly likely that she has a skin rash (a common symptom of Chicken pox).\n\nNow, let's consider the two options:\n\n(a) She has a skin rash.\n(b) She has a skin rash and a thyroid nodule.\n\nSince we've established that it's highly likely she has a skin rash (due to the Chicken pox diagnosis), option (a) is a relatively straightforward and probable scenario.\n\nOption (b) adds an additional condition - a thyroid nodule - which may or may not be related to the Chicken pox diagnosis. This additional condition reduces the overall probability of the scenario.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, I select:\n\n(a) She has a skin rash.\n\nThis answer avoids the conjunction fallacy by recognizing that the probability of a single event (having a skin rash) is higher than the probability of a conjunction of events (having a skin rash and a thyroid nodule).",
