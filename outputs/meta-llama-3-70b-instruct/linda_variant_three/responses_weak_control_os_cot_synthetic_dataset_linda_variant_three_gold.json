The key insight is that statement (a) is a conjunction of two events: hip joint pain and joint pain. \n3. Since joint pain is a more general term that includes hip joint pain, the conjunction (a) is actually a subset of (b).\n4. Therefore, the probability of (a) cannot be greater than the probability of (b), because (a) is a more specific and restrictive condition.\n\nWith this reasoning, I conclude that:\n\nThe correct answer is (b) He experiences hip joint pain.\n\nThe probability of experiencing hip joint pain is higher than the probability of experiencing both hip joint pain and joint pain, because the latter is a more specific and restrictive condition.",

Jaundice is a medical condition characterized by yellowish discoloration of the skin and eyes.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the two options:\n\n(a) Sam has yellowish skin.\n(b) Sam has yellowish skin and weight loss.\n\nSince Sam has jaundice, it's highly likely that Sam has yellowish skin (a common symptom of jaundice). So, option (a) is quite probable.\n\nOption (b) includes the same symptom (yellowish skin) plus an additional factor (weight loss). While weight loss could be a symptom of some underlying condition, it's not a direct consequence of jaundice.\n\nHere's the key insight: the probability of (b) cannot be higher than the probability of (a), since (b) includes (a) plus an additional condition. In other words, the probability of Sam having yellowish skin and weight loss is lower than or equal to the probability of Sam simply having yellowish skin.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Sam has yellowish skin.\n\nI hope this step-by-step analysis helps clarify the correct answer!",

So, it's likely that Morgan experiences dehydration.\n\nNow, let's look at option (a). It adds an additional symptom, sunken eyes, to dehydration. While sunken eyes could be a symptom of dehydration, it's an additional condition that might not necessarily occur in every case of dehydration.\n\nGiven that dehydration is a likely symptom of Gastroenteritis, and option (b) only mentions dehydration, it's more probable that Morgan experiences dehydration (option b) than experiencing both dehydration and sunken eyes (option a).\n\nSo, my answer is:\n\n(b) Morgan also experiences dehydration.\n\nAm I correct?",
