Paralysis is often associated with weakness or loss of motor function in a specific part of the body.\n\nOption (b) \"He experiences weakness of one body side\" is a common symptom of paralysis, especially after a brain hemorrhage.\n\nOption (a) \"He experiences weakness of one body side and excessive sneezing\" is less likely, as excessive sneezing is not a typical symptom of paralysis or brain hemorrhage.\n\nTherefore, I select option (b) as the more likely outcome.",
