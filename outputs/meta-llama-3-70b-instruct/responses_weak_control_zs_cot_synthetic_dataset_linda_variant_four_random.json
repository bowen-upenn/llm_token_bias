This is a conjunction of two events.\n\nA key principle in probability theory is that the probability of a conjunction (two events occurring together) is always less than or equal to the probability of each individual event.\n\nIn this case, the probability of the podcast receiving mediocre reviews (option a) is higher than the probability of the podcast receiving mediocre reviews AND gaining millions of subscribers (option b). This is because option b requires two specific events to occur, which makes it less likely.\n\nTherefore, I select option (a): The podcast receives mediocre reviews.\n\nThis might go against our intuition, but probability theory tells us that the simpler event (option a) is more likely than the conjunction of events (option b).",
