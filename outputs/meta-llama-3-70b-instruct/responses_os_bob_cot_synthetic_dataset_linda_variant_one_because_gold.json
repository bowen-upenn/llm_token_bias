Option (a) simply states that Lisa would plan another trip to a new destination. This is a straightforward statement that doesn't provide any additional information.\n\nOption (b) adds more context to why Lisa might plan another trip. It mentions that she wants to continue exploring different cultures and capturing her experiences in photographs. This additional information aligns with what we already know about Lisa: she enjoyed the cultural experience in Bhutan and took many photos.\n\nGiven this analysis, I think option (b) is a more detailed and specific explanation of why Lisa might plan another trip. However, since both options essentially convey the same idea \u2013 that Lisa will plan another trip \u2013 I would argue that option (a) is still the more likely answer. The added context in option (b) doesn't necessarily make it more probable than option (a).\n\nSo, my answer is:\n\n(a) The protagonist, Lisa, would likely plan another trip to a new destination.",

The policeman also tells the protagonist that he can't walk on that street anymore.\n\nFrom this, we can infer that the policeman likely stopped the protagonist because he suspected him of committing a crime (taking a wallet). The fact that the policeman told the protagonist he can't walk on that street anymore suggests that the policeman might have issued some kind of warning or restriction.\n\nNow, considering the two options:\n\n(a) The protagonist would likely speak with a lawyer.\n(b) The protagonist would likely speak with a lawyer because he believes his rights were violated when the policeman stopped him from walking down the street.\n\nOption (b) provides a specific reason why the protagonist might want to speak with a lawyer, which is because he believes his rights were violated. However, based on the information provided, we don't have any evidence to suggest that the protagonist is concerned about his rights being violated. He might be innocent, guilty, or simply confused about what happened.\n\nGiven the limited information, option (a) seems more plausible. The protagonist might want to speak with a lawyer simply to understand his situation, clarify what happened, or get advice on how to proceed. He might not necessarily believe his rights were violated.\n\nSo, my answer is: (a) The protagonist would likely speak with a lawyer.",
