This means that despite the album not being successful, the tour is extremely successful.\n\nNow, let's think about it. If the album is not successful (won't chart in any country), it's unlikely that the tour would sell out all the major venues. Usually, a successful tour is driven by the popularity of the album.\n\nSo, considering the two options, I would choose:\n\n(a) The album won't chart in any country.\n\nThis is because it's more likely that the album won't chart in any country, and it's even more unlikely that the tour would sell out all the major venues if the album is not successful.",

The probability of the second part of this statement (becoming bestsellers despite poor reviews) is likely lower than the probability of the first part (receiving poor reviews), since it's unusual for products with poor reviews to become bestsellers.\n\nSince the probability of (b) is the probability of (a) multiplied by the probability of the second part of the statement, the probability of (b) must be less than or equal to the probability of (a).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n(a) The headphones receive poor reviews.",

This means that, despite ultimately winning the tournament without dropping a set, he faces some challenges or close calls in the early rounds.\n\nNow, let's think about the probabilities. Option (a) is already a highly unlikely event, as it requires Federer to win every set in every match. Option (b) is even more specific and restrictive, as it adds the condition that he struggles in the early rounds. This makes option (b) even less likely than option (a).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Federer wins the tournament without dropping a single set.",

Receiving a standing ovation from all present is a possible scenario, but it's not a guarantee.\n\nHowever, option (b) adds an additional detail - dramatically removing his shoe and banging it on the table. This is a very specific and unusual action. While it's possible, it's much less likely than just receiving a standing ovation.\n\nTherefore, I would choose option (a) He will receive a standing ovation from all present.\n\nThe correct answer is (a) He will receive a standing ovation from all present.",

This is a single event.\n\nOption (b) states that the book becomes a bestseller in the USA but is heavily criticized by Western scholars. This is a conjunction of two events: the book becomes a bestseller in the USA, and it is heavily criticized by Western scholars.\n\nIn general, the probability of a conjunction of events is lower than the probability of a single event. This is because the conjunction requires both events to occur, whereas the single event only requires one thing to happen.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that option (a) is more likely than option (b).\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n(a) The book becomes a bestseller in the USA.",
