There are two possible outcomes:\n\n(a) The movie receives bad reviews.\n(b) The movie receives bad reviews but still grosses over $100 million worldwide.\n\nNow, let's think about it. If the movie receives bad reviews, it's possible that it might not do well at the box office. However, it's also possible that despite the bad reviews, the movie could still gross over $100 million worldwide due to various factors such as marketing, star power, or other external factors.\n\nGiven these possibilities, I would say that option (b) is more likely. The movie receiving bad reviews is a possibility, but the additional condition of still grossing over $100 million worldwide makes option (b) a more specific and detailed outcome.\n\nSo, my answer is: (b) The movie receives bad reviews but still grosses over $100 million worldwide.",

However, there's no guarantee that the movie will resonate with audiences or perform well at the box office.\n\nGiven these points, I think option (a) is more likely. The movie receiving high critical acclaim is a more probable outcome than the additional condition of performing poorly at the box office.\n\nSo, my answer is: (a) The movie receives high critical acclaim.",

This is also a possible outcome, but it adds an additional condition (breaking the record for stunts) to the initial condition (failing to make a profit).\n\nSince option (b) is a more specific and restrictive outcome than option (a), it is less likely to occur.

The difference lies in the additional information provided in option (b) - \"but will be critically acclaimed\".\n\nSince we have no information about the quality of the book or the author's writing skills, we can't predict whether the book will be critically acclaimed or not.
