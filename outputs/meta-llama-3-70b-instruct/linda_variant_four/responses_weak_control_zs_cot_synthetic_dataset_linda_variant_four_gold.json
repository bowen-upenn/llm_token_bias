Teng Hsiao-Ping is advising on China's economic policies in 2023.\n2. We need to determine which option is more likely:\n   (a) He implements a completely free-market system.\n   (b) He implements a completely free-market system but maintains strong state control over key industries.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\nOption (a) is a single event: implementing a completely free-market system.\n\nOption (b) is a conjunction of two events: implementing a completely free-market system AND maintaining strong state control over key industries.\n\nIn general, the probability of a conjunction of events (A and B) is less than or equal to the probability of each individual event (A or B). This is because the conjunction requires both events to occur, which is typically less likely than either event occurring alone.\n\nApplying this principle, we can conclude that option (b) is less likely than option (a) because it requires two specific conditions to be met, whereas option (a) only requires one.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) He implements a completely free-market system.\n\nThis might seem counterintuitive, but the key is to recognize that the conjunction of events in option (b) makes it less probable than the single event in option (a).",
