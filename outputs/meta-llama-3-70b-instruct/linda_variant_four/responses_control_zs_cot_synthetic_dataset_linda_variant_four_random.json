        "init_model_answer": "I'll choose option (a) He compromises his legal principles.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n* The probability of James J. Sirica compromising his legal principles (option a) is higher than the probability of him compromising his legal principles AND ultimately upholding the integrity of the legal process (option b).\n* The conjunction of two events (compromising legal principles and upholding integrity) is less likely to occur than one of the events alone (compromising legal principles).\n* By ignoring the narrative context and focusing on the probabilistic models, I can see that option (a) is more likely to occur than option (b).",
