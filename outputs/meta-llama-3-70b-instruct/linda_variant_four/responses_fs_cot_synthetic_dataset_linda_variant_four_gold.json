This is a single, standalone statement.\n\nOption (b) states that the movie is a box office disaster, but also adds an additional condition, which is that it receives critical acclaim for its direction and storytelling.\n\nIn general, when we add more conditions to an event, it becomes less probable. This is because the event must satisfy all the conditions, making it more specific and therefore less likely to occur.\n\nSo, in this case, option (b) is a more specific and restrictive scenario than option (a). It's possible for a movie to be a box office disaster without receiving critical acclaim, but if it receives critical acclaim, it's less likely to be a box office disaster.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) The movie is a box office disaster.",
