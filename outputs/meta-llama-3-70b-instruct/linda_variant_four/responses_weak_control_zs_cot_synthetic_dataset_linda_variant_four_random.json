(b) He struggles to understand contemporary geopolitics but eventually brokers a groundbreaking international agreement: This is a conjunction of two events. The first part is the same as (a), and the second part adds an additional event, which is a more specific and less probable outcome.\n\nNow, let's apply the probability rules:\n\n* The probability of (a) is higher than the probability of (b) because (b) is a more specific and restrictive outcome.\n* The conjunction of two events is always less probable than either of the individual events.\n\nTherefore, I choose option (a): He struggles to understand contemporary geopolitics.\n\nThis is because it's more likely that James Catlett Marshall struggles to understand contemporary geopolitics than it is that he struggles and then achieves a groundbreaking international agreement.",
