They have a dedicated fan base across the world.\n\nOption (a) suggests that the album won't chart in any country, which means it won't be popular or successful in terms of sales or airplay. Given the band's reputation and fan base, this seems unlikely.\n\nOption (b) suggests that the album won't chart in any country, but their world tour will sell out all the major venues. This is a contradictory scenario, as a successful world tour typically requires a popular album to promote.\n\nConsidering the band's reputation and fan base, it's more likely that the album will chart in at least some countries. Therefore, I'll choose neither option (a) nor option (b) as they both seem unlikely.\n\nHowever, if I had to choose between the two, I would select option (b) as the more likely scenario. Although it's unlikely that the album won't chart at all, it's possible that the band's loyal fan base will still support their tour, even if the album doesn't perform as well as expected.\n\nSo, my answer is:\n\n(b) The album won't chart in any country but their world tour sells out all the major venues.",

During his tenure, he is known for his efforts to rebuild and restore West Germany's economy and international relations after the devastation of World War II.\n\nGiven this historical context, it's more likely that Konrad Adenauer would focus on improving both Germany's international relations and domestic economy. In fact, Adenauer's government is credited with implementing policies that led to West Germany's economic miracle (Wirtschaftswunder) and improving relations with Western countries, including the United States.\n\nTherefore, based on this information, I would select option (b) as the less likely scenario: He fails to improve Germany's international relations but successfully revives the domestic economy. This implies that Adenauer would be unsuccessful in one area (international relations) but successful in another (domestic economy), which contradicts his actual achievements.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (b) He fails to improve Germany's international relations but successfully revives the domestic economy.",
