It's likely that their fans have been waiting for this reunion for a long time.\n\nConsidering this, it's more likely that the first concert would have a high audience turnout, rather than a low one. Fans would be excited to see the Spice Girls perform live again, and the initial hype would probably drive ticket sales.\n\nHowever, option (b) suggests that despite a low audience turnout at the first concert, they would still sell out multiple stadiums later in the tour. This seems contradictory, as a low turnout at the first concert would imply a lack of interest, which wouldn't lead to sold-out stadiums later on.\n\nTherefore, I would choose neither option (a) nor option (b) as the correct answer. A more likely scenario would be that the first concert has a high audience turnout, and the tour is successful overall.\n\nBut if I had to choose between the two options, I would select:\n\n(b) The first concert has low audience turnout but they sell out multiple stadiums later in the tour.\n\nThis is because, although it's unlikely, it's still possible that the first concert has some issues (e.g., poor marketing, bad weather, etc.) that affect attendance, but the Spice Girls' popularity and fan enthusiasm would still drive ticket sales for the rest of the tour.",

This is a compound event, meaning it consists of two events: losing the fight and winning the rematch. For this to happen, Alvarez must first lose the fight (with probability p) and then win the rematch (with probability q, which is likely to be different from p).\n\nSince option (b) requires two events to occur, its probability is the product of the probabilities of each event: p \u00d7 q.
