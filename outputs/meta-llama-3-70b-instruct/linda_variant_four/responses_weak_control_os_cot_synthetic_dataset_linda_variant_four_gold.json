Federer wins the tournament without dropping a single set (option a) is a specific outcome.\n2. Federer wins the tournament without dropping a single set but struggles in the early rounds (option b) is a more specific outcome that includes the first outcome plus an additional condition (struggling in the early rounds).\n\nSince option b is a more specific outcome, it is less likely to occur than option a. In other words, it's more probable that Federer wins the tournament without dropping a single set (option a) than winning the tournament without dropping a single set and struggling in the early rounds (option b).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Federer wins the tournament without dropping a single set.",

Consider the probability of (a) The book becomes a bestseller in the USA.\nThis is a single event, and we can assess its probability based on various factors, such as the book's content, marketing, and audience interest.\n\n2. Now, consider the probability of (b) The book becomes a bestseller in the USA but is heavily criticized by Western scholars.\nThis is a conjunction of two events: the book becoming a bestseller and being heavily criticized by Western scholars. For this to occur, both events must happen.\n\n3. Think about it: for the book to be heavily criticized by Western scholars, it first needs to become a bestseller. If it doesn't become a bestseller, it's unlikely to be heavily criticized.\n\nGiven this, it's clear that the probability of (b) is lower than or equal to the probability of (a), since (b) requires both events to occur, whereas (a) only requires one event.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n(a) The book becomes a bestseller in the USA.\n\nWe've avoided the conjunction fallacy by recognizing that adding more conditions (in this case, being heavily criticized) can only decrease the probability, not increase it.",
