This implies that despite the album not being successful, the tour is still very popular and successful.\n\nNow, let's think about it... If the album doesn't chart in any country, it's likely that it's not well-received or popular.

It's less likely for an unsuccessful album to suddenly lead to a highly successful tour.",

This is possible, but it's unlikely that someone would completely flip their political stance, especially if they're hosting a talk show where their views are a major part of their appeal.\n\nOption (b) adds an additional condition to option (a): not only will John Limbaugh change his political views, but he'll also continue to have high ratings and a large audience. This is even more unlikely than option (a), because changing one's political views can often alienate one's existing audience.\n\nSo, considering the two options, I would choose:\n\n(a) He will entirely change his political views.\n\nThis option is still unlikely, but it's more probable than the combination of changing political views and maintaining high ratings and a large audience.",

This is a single event, and it's possible that she might not perform well in the primaries.\n\nOption (b) states that Jessica Harris will lose in the primary elections but be chosen as the vice-presidential candidate again. This option implies two events: losing in the primary elections and being chosen as the vice-presidential candidate again.\n\nSince option (b) includes everything in option (a) plus an additional event, it's actually less likely to occur than option (a). Losing in the primary elections is a necessary condition for option (b) to happen, but it's not sufficient. She would also need to be chosen as the vice-presidential candidate again, which is an additional requirement.\n\nTherefore, I select:\n\n(a) Jessica Harris will lose in the primary elections.\n\nThis option is more likely because it only requires one event to occur, whereas option (b) requires two events to occur.",

This is a more specific and unusual scenario.\n\nConsidering the possibilities, I would choose:\n\n(b) He will receive a standing ovation from all present but then dramatically remove his shoe and bang it on the table.\n\nThe reason is that option (b) includes everything in option (a) plus an additional event, which makes it a more specific and detailed scenario.

This implies that while the economy is largely free, the government still exercises significant control over certain crucial sectors.\n\nConsidering China's economic history and current policies, it's unlikely that they would adopt a completely free-market system with no government control. China has traditionally maintained a strong state presence in strategic industries, and it's more plausible that they would continue to do so while still promoting market-oriented reforms.\n\nTherefore, I choose option (b) He implements a completely free-market system but maintains strong state control over key industries.",
