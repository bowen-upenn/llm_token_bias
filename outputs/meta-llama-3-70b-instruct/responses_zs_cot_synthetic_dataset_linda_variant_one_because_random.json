This is a reasonable assumption, given that Missy was already playing Nintendo and Billy was now playing too. It's likely that they would play together.\n\nOption (b) adds an additional condition: \"because it was raining outside.\" However, there is no mention of the weather in the original story.

The fact that Ben cried when he met his favorite wrestler and got the autograph suggests that the shirt holds sentimental value for him.\n\nOption (b) is not relevant to the story and seems unrelated to the context.
