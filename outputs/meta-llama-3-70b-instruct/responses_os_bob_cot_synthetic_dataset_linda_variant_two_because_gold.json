He mentions that it's an \"overdue moment of U.S. lucidity\" and that it shows support for national sovereignty in Latin America.\n\nHe also states that this change removes a pretext for Cuban leadership to claim \"moral authority\" in the face of U.S. hostility. This suggests that Perez believes the new policy will give Cubans more autonomy and freedom to make their own decisions.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n(a) policy gives Cubans space to decide own best interests\n(b) policy gives Cubans space to decide own best interests because people tend to give priority to their own interests and values.\n\nOption (a) is a direct consequence of Perez's statements, as he implies that the new policy will allow Cubans to make their own decisions without U.S. interference.\n\nOption (b) adds an additional reason why Cubans will prioritize their own interests, which is not explicitly mentioned in the text. While it's a plausible assumption, it's not directly supported by the provided information.\n\nTherefore, I choose option (a) policy gives Cubans space to decide own best interests.",
