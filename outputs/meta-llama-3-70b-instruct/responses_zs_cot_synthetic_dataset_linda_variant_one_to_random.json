In this scenario, it's likely that the presidential candidate would want to acknowledge the bird's presence to show that they can think on their feet and respond to unexpected situations.\n\nHowever, it's less likely that the candidate would immediately start discussing policy changes in response to the bird's presence. The situation is more comedic than serious, and the crowd is cheering because of the unexpected interruption, not because they're interested in hearing about policy changes.\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is:\n\n(a) The protagonist would likely continue with the speech while acknowledging the bird's presence.",
