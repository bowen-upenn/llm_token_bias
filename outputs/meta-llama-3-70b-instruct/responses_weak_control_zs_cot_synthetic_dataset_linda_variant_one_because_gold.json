Given this situation, what is Ken likely to do?\n\nThe more likely option is (a) Ken searches for the gift at another store or online.\n\nThis makes sense because Ken wants to get the gift for his wife, and since it's not available at this particular store, he would naturally look for it elsewhere.\n\nOption (b) adds an additional clause, \"because he feels that this gift perfectly expresses his love for her.\" While this might be true, it's not necessary to assume this motivation in order to conclude that Ken will search for the gift elsewhere. Ken might simply want to get the gift because it's what his wife wants, or because he thinks she'll like it, etc.\n\nBy adding the extra clause, option (b) becomes a conjunction of two events: Ken searching for the gift elsewhere AND he does so because of his feelings.

This is a straightforward prediction based on his previous behavior (visiting the Empire State building and sending pictures).\n\nOption (b) adds an additional condition: \"because he enjoys photography as a hobby.\" This extra information might make the scenario more believable or appealing, but it doesn't necessarily increase the likelihood of the event.\n\nIn fact, adding this condition makes the conjunction (visit landmarks + send pictures + enjoy photography as a hobby) less likely than the simpler statement in option (a). This is because the conjunction requires all three conditions to be true, whereas option (a) only requires two.\n\nSo, I'll choose:\n\n(a) Yannick would likely visit other iconic landmarks in New York City and send pictures to his friends.\n\nThe correct answer is option (a).",

We have two options: (a) Ken might start a diet or buy new clothes that fit better, and (b) Ken might start a diet or buy new clothes that fit better because he felt embarrassed when his jeans tore in public.\n\n2. Option (a) presents two possible actions that Ken might take: starting a diet or buying new clothes that fit better. This is a disjunction, meaning one or both of these actions could happen.\n\n3. Option (b) adds an additional condition to option (a): \"because he felt embarrassed when his jeans tore in public.\" This is a conjunction, meaning both the action (starting a diet or buying new clothes) and the reason (feeling embarrassed) must be true.\n\n4. The key insight here is that adding more conditions to an event (in this case, the reason for Ken's action) makes the event less likely to occur. This is because the conjunction of two events is always less probable than either event alone.\n\nTherefore, I explicitly select option (a) as the more likely scenario: Ken might start a diet or buy new clothes that fit better.\n\nThe correct answer is (a).",
