The comparison between the inflatable toad and Jiang Zemin is likely a form of satire or mockery.\n2. The fact that \"toad\" is censored on Sina Weibo suggests that the Chinese government is trying to suppress this particular form of satire or criticism.\n\nGiven these inferences, it's more likely that Chinese netizens are using internet jokes to communicate about politics as a way to circumvent censorship and express their opinions in a subtle way.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Chinese netizens use Internet jokes to communicate about politics.",
