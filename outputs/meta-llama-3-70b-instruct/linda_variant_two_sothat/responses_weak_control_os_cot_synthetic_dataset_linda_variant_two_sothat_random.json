We have a description of Robert Lyons, which provides some context about his behavior.\n2. We are asked to choose between two options:\n   (a) Was found in Hooters hours later\n   (b) Was found in Hooters hours later so that he could watch a football game on the big screen TVs.\n\nNow, let's think about probability:\n\nOption (a) simply states that Robert Lyons was found in Hooters hours later. This is a straightforward statement about his location.\n\nOption (b) adds an additional detail, specifying the reason why he was found in Hooters (to watch a football game on the big screen TVs).\n\nHere's the key: the additional detail in option (b) does not increase the probability of the event. In fact, it makes the scenario more specific and therefore less likely.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Was found in Hooters hours later.\n\nThe conjunction fallacy would lead us to choose option (b) because it provides a more detailed and coherent narrative. However, from a probabilistic perspective, option (a) is more likely because it is a more general statement.",
