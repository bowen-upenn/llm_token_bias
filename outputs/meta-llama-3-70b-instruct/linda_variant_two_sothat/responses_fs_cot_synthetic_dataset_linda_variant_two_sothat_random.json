The context is about the Libyan people celebrating their liberation, and the NTC's vice chairman has just announced that the Libyan lands have been completely liberated. It's likely that the NTC's chairman, Mustafa Jalil, would make a statement calling for patience and tolerance in this situation.\n\nThe question is whether it's more likely that he would make a general call for patience and tolerance (option a) or a specific call for patience and tolerance for the purpose of encouraging local farmers to plant more olive trees (option b).\n\nIt's more probable that Mustafa Jalil would make a general call for patience and tolerance, without specifying a particular reason like olive tree farming.

It's more likely that the hotel's design is simply a matter of aesthetic choice, rather than being motivated by a desire to claim a specific record.",
