If the police had simply stated that Gray pointed a gun at them without providing further context, it's possible that Carol Gray and others might still have questions about the incident.\n\nOption (b) provides more context and suggests that the police felt threatened by Gray's actions, which led them to respond with lethal force.

However, the original Kickstarter project description mentions that Zack has never made potato salad and the end result might be bad, implying that people are donating more as a joke or to support the absurdity of the project rather than to help Zack improve his potato salad-making skills.\n\nConsidering the context, I think option (a) is more likely.

However, the passage doesn't mention anything about the sons being involved in the incident or trying to help their father.\n\nOn the other hand, option (a) simply states that the sons were with him when he died, without providing any additional context.

If Chinese netizens were simply using internet jokes to communicate about politics, there wouldn't be a need for censorship.\n\n(b) Chinese netizens use Internet jokes to communicate about politics so that they can subtly critique the government without facing direct censorship.\n\nThis option provides a more plausible explanation. By using internet jokes, Chinese netizens can express their opinions about politics in a way that avoids direct censorship. The fact that \"toad\" is a censored word suggests that the government is trying to suppress comparisons between the inflatable toad and Jiang Zemin, which implies that the joke is being used to critique the government.\n\nTherefore, I select option (b) as the more likely explanation.",
