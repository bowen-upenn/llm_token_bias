By the time the two others in his hunting party arrived, the man was dead.\n3. The story mentions that one of those hunters did something to the grizzly bear.\n\nNow, let's examine the options:\n\n(a) One of those hunters shot and killed the grizzly bear, they say.\n(b) One of those hunters shot and killed the grizzly bear, they say so that they could impress their friends back home.\n\nOption (a) is a straightforward and logical consequence of the bear attack. It's likely that the hunters would want to protect themselves and prevent further harm, so killing the bear would be a reasonable response.\n\nOption (b) adds an unnecessary and unlikely motivation for the hunters' action. While it's possible that someone might want to impress their friends, it's unlikely that this would be the primary reason for shooting the bear in this situation.\n\nTherefore, based on the context and the information provided, I choose option (a) as the more likely scenario:\n\n(a) One of those hunters shot and killed the grizzly bear, they say.",
