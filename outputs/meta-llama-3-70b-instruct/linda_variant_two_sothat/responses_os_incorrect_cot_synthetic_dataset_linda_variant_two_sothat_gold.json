The Pentagon has reported the incident.\n\nGiven this context, it's likely that the White House would respond to the incident. The question is, which response is more likely?\n\nOption (a) simply states that the White House said the incident was a provocation and raised an objection with Beijing. This is a plausible response, as the White House would likely condemn the aggressive behavior of the Chinese fighter jet.\n\nOption (b) adds more context to the White House's response. It suggests that the White House not only objected to the incident but also used it as an opportunity to emphasize the US's commitment to maintaining freedom of navigation in the region. This is also a plausible response, as the South China Sea is a contentious region where the US and China have competing interests.\n\nConsidering the context, I think option (b) is more likely. The White House would likely use this incident to reiterate its commitment to freedom of navigation in the region, in addition to objecting to the Chinese fighter jet's aggressive behavior.\n\nSo, my answer is: (b) White House said the incident was a provocation, raised objection with Beijing so that the U.S. could emphasize its commitment to maintaining freedom of navigation in the region.",

This implies that the journalist was trying to maintain a professional and informative tone in the debate.\n\nGiven the journalist's experience and expertise, it's more likely that they would try to steer the conversation back to campaign issues, rather than simply admitting to a mistake without context.\n\nTherefore, I choose option (b) as the more likely scenario.",
