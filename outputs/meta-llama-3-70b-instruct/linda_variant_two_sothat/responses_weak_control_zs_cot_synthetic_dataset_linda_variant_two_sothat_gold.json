Option (b) adds additional information to (a): Georgia wants to join NATO to better secure its national boundaries and deter foreign military threats.\n\nNow, the key insight here is that option (b) is a more specific and detailed version of option (a). It's like saying \"Georgia wants to join NATO\" (a) and then adding \"and here's why\" (b).\n\nIn probability theory, the more specific and detailed scenario (b) cannot be more likely than the simpler scenario (a). This is because the probability of (b) is a subset of the probability of (a).\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Georgia, formerly part of the Soviet Union, now has ambitions of joining NATO.\n\nThis may seem counterintuitive, but the conjunction fallacy is a common mistake in probability reasoning. We tend to think that the more detailed scenario is more likely because it provides a clearer narrative, but in reality, it's just a more specific version of the simpler scenario.",

This is a conjunction of two events: Al Qaeda seeking the release of five prisoners and the immediate release of Wolfgang Ebner and Andrea Kloiber.\n\nIt is more likely that Al Qaeda contacted the Austrian government to seek the release of five prisoners (option a) than to seek the release of five prisoners with the additional condition that Wolfgang Ebner and Andrea Kloiber would be freed immediately (option b).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Al Qaeda contacted Austrian government to seek release of five prisoners.",

Because option (b) is a conjunction of two events: the auction starts on Thursday and runs through May 22, AND it's for the purpose of allowing global collectors to participate. The probability of both events occurring together (conjunction) is lower than the probability of just one event occurring (auction starts on Thursday and runs through May 22).\n\nIn other words, it's more likely that the auction simply starts on Thursday and runs through May 22, regardless of the reason or purpose behind it.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (a).",
