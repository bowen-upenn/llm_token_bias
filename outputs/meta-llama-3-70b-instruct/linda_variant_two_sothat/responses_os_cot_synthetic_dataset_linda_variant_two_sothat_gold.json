We need to compare the two options and determine which one is more probable.\n\nOption (a) states: \"Online auction begins Thursday and runs through May 22\"\n\nOption (b) states: \"Online auction begins Thursday and runs through May 22 so that collectors from around the world can participate in bidding for these historic items.\"\n\nNotice that option (b) is essentially the same as option (a), but with additional information. The additional information in option (b) is not contradictory to option (a), but rather provides a reason or explanation for the auction's timing.\n\nGiven that option (a) is a more concise statement, and option (b) is a more detailed version of the same statement, I would argue that option (a) is more likely.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Online auction begins Thursday and runs through May 22",

The fact that the third suspect is injured already implies that they might be captured by the police.\n\nSo, which option is more likely? It's option (a) Two suspects died and a third is injured.\n\nBy selecting option (a), we are not assuming any additional details about the third suspect's capture.

There could be other factors at play, such as the quake's depth, the type of faulting, or the island's infrastructure.\n\nGiven this, it's more likely that the quake was centered more than 250 miles off Sumatra, regardless of whether or not major damage was reported on the island.
