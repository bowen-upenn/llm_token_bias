Given this context, we need to evaluate the two options:\n\n(a) Taylor has pleaded not guilty to charges that include crimes against humanity\n(b) Taylor has pleaded not guilty to charges that include crimes against humanity so that he could have more time to enjoy reading his favorite novels.\n\nOption (a) is a straightforward statement that is consistent with the context. It's a common response for someone accused of a crime to plead not guilty.\n\nOption (b) adds an additional reason for Taylor's plea, which is unrelated to the charges or the context. It's unlikely that Taylor would plead not guilty solely to have more time to read his favorite novels.\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is:\n\n(a) Taylor has pleaded not guilty to charges that include crimes against humanity.",
