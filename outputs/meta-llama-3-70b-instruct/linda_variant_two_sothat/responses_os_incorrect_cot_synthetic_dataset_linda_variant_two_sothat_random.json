This means we need to consider the emissions per capita, not the total emissions.\n\nThe fact that the US has reduced its emissions by 3.7% in 2012 suggests that the US is taking steps to reduce its emissions. Additionally, the statement doesn't provide any information about China's population or its efforts to reduce emissions.\n\nGiven this information, it is more likely that:\n\n(a) But pollution per person is highest in the United States\n\nThis is because the US has a higher standard of living and consumes more energy per capita, which could contribute to higher emissions per person.",
