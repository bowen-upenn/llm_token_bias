        "init_model_answer": "Let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe passage mentions that a Thai-themed restaurant in Madrid implements anti-H1N1 flu measures, such as taking employees' temperatures, opening windows, and providing gel. This shows that the restaurant owner is taking proactive steps to prevent the spread of flu.\n\nNow, let's consider the two options:\n\n(a) Restaurant owner says there is \"a big response\" from other owners\n(b) Restaurant owner says there is \"a big response\" from other owners because they are impressed with the proactive steps taken to prevent the spread of flu.\n\nOption (b) provides a clear reason for the \"big response\" from other owners, which is that they are impressed with the restaurant's proactive measures. This makes sense, as other owners might be interested in learning from or emulating the restaurant's efforts to prevent the spread of flu.\n\nOption (a) is vague and doesn't provide a clear reason for the \"big response\" from other owners.\n\nTherefore, based on the context, I choose option (b) as the more likely scenario:\n\n(b) Restaurant owner says there is \"a big response\" from other owners because they are impressed with the proactive steps taken to prevent the spread of flu.",
