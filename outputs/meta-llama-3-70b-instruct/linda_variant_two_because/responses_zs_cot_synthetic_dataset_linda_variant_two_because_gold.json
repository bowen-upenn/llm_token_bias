Option (a) simply states that the ship was carrying humanitarian aid, which is a plausible reason for the ship to be in Gazan waters.\n\nOption (b) adds an additional layer of justification, citing international law. While this might be true, it's not necessarily the most direct or obvious response from a human rights group.\n\nBased on this analysis, I would choose:\n\n(a) Human rights group says ship was carrying humanitarian aid to Gaza",
