In fact, it might even make it less likely, as it adds an extra condition that needs to be met.\n* Therefore, the probability of (a) is higher than the probability of (b), because (a) is a more general statement that is not conditional on additional factors.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (a) Israel fears any aid would bolster Hamas, officials say.",

The residents enjoy eating ice cream on Sundays in the park\n\nThe conjunction fallacy occurs when we overestimate the probability of a conjunction (two events occurring together) compared to the probability of one of the individual events.\n\nIn this case, option (a) is a single statement, while option (b) is a conjunction of two statements. The probability of a conjunction is always less than or equal to the probability of one of the individual events.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Buzios offers a bevy of choice beaches and nightlife options\n\nThis option is more likely because it doesn't involve the additional, unrelated condition of residents enjoying ice cream on Sundays in the park.",

This is a plausible scenario, and it's easy to imagine Hayward making such a statement in an ad.\n\nOption (b) is a more specific and unusual statement. It not only includes the promise \"We will get this done\" but also adds the additional detail about Hayward feeling confident because of his lucky socks. This added detail is unlikely and seems unrelated to the main promise.\n\nNow, let's apply the concept of the conjunction fallacy. The conjunction fallacy occurs when people overestimate the probability of a conjunction of events (in this case, the promise and the lucky socks) compared to the probability of one of the events alone (the promise).\n\nIn this case, the probability of option (a) is higher than the probability of option (b) because option (b) is a more specific and unusual scenario.
