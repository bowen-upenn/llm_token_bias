The key to this question is to recognize that option (b) is a conjunction of two statements: \"Israel fears any aid would bolster Hamas\" and \"it would violate existing sanctions against the terrorist organization.\"\n\n5. The probability of a conjunction (two events occurring together) is always less than or equal to the probability of each individual event.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Israel fears any aid would bolster Hamas, officials say\n\nThis option is more probable because it's a simpler statement that doesn't involve the additional condition mentioned in option (b).",

Option (a) states that \"A later MRI scan revealed Mr Green had a severe neck injury\". This is a simple statement about the outcome of an MRI scan.\n3. Option (b) states that \"A later MRI scan revealed Mr Green had a severe neck injury because he was involved in a car accident\". This statement adds an additional piece of information, namely the cause of the neck injury (a car accident).\n\nNow, let's think about it logically:\n\n* Option (a) is a straightforward statement about the outcome of an MRI scan. It doesn't provide any additional information about the cause of the injury.\n* Option (b) is a more specific statement that not only states the outcome of the MRI scan but also provides a reason for the injury (a car accident).\n\nHere's the key insight: the additional information in option (b) makes it less likely to be true. Why? Because we're adding an extra condition (the car accident) that must be true for the statement to be true. This increases the number of things that need to happen for the statement to be true, making it less probable.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) A later MRI scan revealed Mr Green had a severe neck injury.\n\nThis is because option (a) is a more general statement that only requires the MRI scan to reveal a severe neck injury, whereas option (b) requires both the MRI scan to reveal a severe neck injury and the additional condition of a car accident to be true.",
