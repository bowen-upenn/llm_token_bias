This is a vague statement that doesn't provide any context or reason for the response.\n\nOption (b) adds more context to the statement, providing a reason for the big response: the other owners are impressed with the proactive steps taken to prevent the spread of flu.\n\nGiven the context of the passage, which mentions the restaurant's implementation of anti-H1N1 flu measures, it's more likely that the big response from other owners is due to their admiration for the restaurant's proactive steps.\n\nTherefore, I choose option (b) as the more likely scenario.",
