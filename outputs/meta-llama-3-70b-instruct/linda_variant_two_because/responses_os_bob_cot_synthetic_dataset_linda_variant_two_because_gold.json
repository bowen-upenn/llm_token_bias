The phrase \"shock male writers\" implies that the women writers are sharing something that the male writers didn't expect or understand, which is more likely to be a genuine revelation rather than a stereotypical comment about women being \"more in touch with their emotions\".\n\nOption (b) seems to perpetuate a stereotype about women being more emotional, which might not be the case.

This suggests that the context is about a controversy or scandal involving taxes.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n(a) Obama also discusses declining economy and fight against terrorist groups\n(b) Obama also discusses declining economy and fight against terrorist groups because the public is more interested in those topics than in his personal admission of responsibility.\n\nBoth options mention Obama discussing the economy and terrorist groups, but option (b) adds a reason why he's discussing those topics. However, there's no indication in the passage that the public's interest is the reason for Obama's discussion. The passage only mentions Obama taking responsibility and Daschle apologizing, without providing any information about the public's interest.\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is:\n\n(a) Obama also discusses declining economy and fight against terrorist groups",
