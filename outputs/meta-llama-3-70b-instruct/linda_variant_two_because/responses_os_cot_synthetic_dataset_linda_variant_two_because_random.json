It also mentions Agra, which is home to the Taj Mahal.\n\nNow, let's consider the two options:\n\n(a) No motive has been determined yet\n(b) No motive has been determined yet because the suspect's car was found parked illegally.\n\nOption (b) provides an additional reason for not determining the motive, which is not supported by the passage. The passage doesn't mention anything about the suspect's car being found parked illegally.\n\nOn the other hand, option (a) simply states that no motive has been determined yet, which is a reasonable conclusion based on the passage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) No motive has been determined yet",

The question asks which is more likely:\n\n(a) Restaurant owner says there is \"a big response\" from other owners\n(b) Restaurant owner says there is \"a big response\" from other owners because they recently adopted a new pet goldfish named Bubbles.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\nOption (a) is a straightforward statement that suggests the restaurant owner is commenting on the response from other owners, likely in the context of the anti-H1N1 flu measures.\n\nOption (b) adds an unrelated and unusual detail about a pet goldfish named Bubbles being the reason for the \"big response\" from other owners. This seems unlikely and unrelated to the context of the anti-H1N1 flu measures.\n\nBased on this analysis, I would choose:\n\n(a) Restaurant owner says there is \"a big response\" from other owners\n\nThis option is more plausible and directly related to the context of the scenario.",
