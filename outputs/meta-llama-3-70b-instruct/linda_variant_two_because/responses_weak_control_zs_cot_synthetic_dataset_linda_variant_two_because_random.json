It's reasonable to assume that international hotel brands and developers might be interested in building new facilities and residences in Ras Al Khaimah (RAK) given its luxury property transformation.\n\n(b) International hotel brands and developers are flocking to RAK to build new facilities and residences because the local cuisine is delicious and the weather is pleasant.\n\nThis statement adds two additional conditions to the original scenario: the local cuisine being delicious and the weather being pleasant. While these conditions might be true, they don't necessarily increase the likelihood of international hotel brands and developers flocking to RAK.\n\nIn fact, the conjunction of these additional conditions makes the scenario less likely than the original statement (a).

It's reasonable to expect that a small department would be strained by a large number of arrests.\n\nNow, let's consider option (b):\n\n* The addition of \"because the local bakery decided to offer a new variety of cupcakes\" is an unrelated and irrelevant detail.

This is a straightforward statement.\n\nOption (b) adds an additional detail, which is that Bergen wears a lucky pair of socks during important missions.
