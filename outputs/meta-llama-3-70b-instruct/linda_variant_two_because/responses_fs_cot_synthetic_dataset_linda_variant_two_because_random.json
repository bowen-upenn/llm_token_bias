The fact that Qatar has a new emir who is eager to improve relations in the region does not change the likelihood of Israel fearing that aid would bolster Hamas. The fear is based on the potential consequence of the aid, not on the motivations of the Qatari emir.\n\nSo, the more likely option is the one that simply states Israel's fear, without adding unnecessary additional information.",

This is a straightforward statement that could be true based on the context of the oil disaster and Hayward's role as BP CEO.\n\nOption (b) adds an additional detail: \"In BP ad, Hayward promises, 'We will get this done because he feels confident wearing his lucky socks'\". This additional detail seems unrelated to the context of the oil disaster and Hayward's role as BP CEO. It's a rather unusual and unrelated reason for making a promise.\n\nGiven the context, it's more likely that Hayward's promise in the BP ad is related to the oil disaster and not because of his lucky socks.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) In BP ad, Hayward promises, \"We will get this done\".",
