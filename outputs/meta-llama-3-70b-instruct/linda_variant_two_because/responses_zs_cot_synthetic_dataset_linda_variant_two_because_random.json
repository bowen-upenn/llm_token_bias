This is a plausible reason why Israel might be hesitant to accept Qatar's offer, as Hamas is a Palestinian Islamist political party that has been involved in conflicts with Israel.\n\nOption (b) adds an additional detail, stating that \"Israel fears any aid would bolster Hamas, officials say because Qatar has a new emir who is eager to improve relations in the region\". This additional detail seems unnecessary to explain Israel's fears, and it's not entirely clear how the new emir's desire to improve relations would affect Israel's concerns about Hamas.\n\nBased on this analysis, I think option (a) is more likely. The fear that aid would bolster Hamas is a sufficient reason for Israel's concerns, and the additional detail in option (b) doesn't add much to the explanation.\n\nSo, my answer is: (a) Israel fears any aid would bolster Hamas, officials say.",
