The mention of a grocery store deal on avocados appears to be a non-sequitur.\n\nOn the other hand, option (a) seems more plausible, given the context of the text. The fact that there have been mudslides following heavy rains and a winter storm warning is in effect suggests that the conditions are still conducive to mudslides.\n\nTherefore, I would select option (a) as the more likely scenario:\n\n(a) Mudslides will remain a threat for the next few days.",
