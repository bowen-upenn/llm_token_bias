Cora takes her antibiotics as prescribed.\n2. She does so because she wants to avoid getting sick again.\n\nNow, the probability of a conjunction (two events happening together) is always less than or equal to the probability of each individual event. In this case, the probability of Cora taking her antibiotics as prescribed (event 1) is higher than the probability of both events happening together (event 1 and event 2).\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Cora would take her antibiotics as prescribed.\n\nOption (a) is more likely because it only requires one event to occur, whereas option (b) requires two events to occur together, making it less likely.",

We know she finally started fitting in.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the two options:\n\n(a) Julie might join a club or group that interests her.\nThis option is a simple statement about Julie's behavior. It's a plausible scenario, given that she's trying to fit in and might be interested in exploring new activities.\n\n(b) Julie might join a club or group that interests her because she wants to make more friends.\nThis option adds an additional reason to the first statement, specifying her motivation for joining the club or group.\n\nHere's the key insight: option (b) is a conjunction of two events: Julie joins a club or group that interests her, AND she does so because she wants to make more friends. This conjunction makes the event more specific and, therefore, less likely than the more general statement in option (a).\n\nSo, I'll choose:\n\n(a) Julie might join a club or group that interests her.\n\nThis option is more likely because it's a simpler, more general statement that doesn't require the additional condition of Julie's motivation.",

The conjunction fallacy would lead us to think that option (b) is more likely because it provides a plausible reason for the protagonist's participation, but in reality, it's the more general statement that is more likely to be true.",

The scenario describes a group of men, including the protagonist, following their commander's orders.\n2. The men are told to break, and they take a well-needed rest.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the two options:\n\n(a) The protagonist would likely join the other men in taking a well-needed rest.\n\nThis option is a straightforward inference based on the context. Since the men are told to break and take a rest, it's reasonable to assume the protagonist will do the same.\n\n(b) The protagonist would likely join the other men in taking a well-needed rest because he was feeling very exhausted after a long week of intense physical training and needed some time to recover.\n\nThis option adds additional information about the protagonist's feelings and circumstances, which is not present in the original scenario. While it's possible that the protagonist might be feeling exhausted, this information is not necessary to infer that they will take a rest.\n\nIn this case, option (a) is more likely because it's a more direct and logical conclusion based on the given information. The additional details in option (b) don't change the likelihood of the protagonist taking a rest, so we should stick with the simpler explanation.\n\nTherefore, I select option (a) as the more likely answer.",
