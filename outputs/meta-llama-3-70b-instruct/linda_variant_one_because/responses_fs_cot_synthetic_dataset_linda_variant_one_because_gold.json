This is an embarrassing situation, and it's likely that Ken would want to avoid this kind of situation in the future.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n(a) Ken might start a diet or buy new clothes that fit better. This is a possible outcome, as Ken might want to take action to avoid feeling embarrassed again.\n\n(b) Ken might start a diet or buy new clothes that fit better because he felt embarrassed when his jeans tore in public. This option adds a specific reason for Ken's action: he felt embarrassed.\n\nIn this case, the correct answer is (a) Ken might start a diet or buy new clothes that fit better.\n\nThe reason is that option (b) adds an extra condition (feeling embarrassed) that is not necessary to explain Ken's behavior. Ken might start a diet or buy new clothes for various reasons, not just because he felt embarrassed. Therefore, option (a) is a more general and likely outcome.",

She finally starts fitting in.\n\nOption (a) simply states that Julie might join a club or group that interests her. This is a plausible scenario, as Julie might be interested in a particular activity or hobby and want to explore it.\n\nOption (b) adds an additional reason to option (a): Julie wants to make more friends. While this is also a possible motivation, it's not necessarily the only reason Julie might join a club or group.\n\nSince option (a) is a more general and straightforward statement, it's more likely to be true. Option (b) adds an additional assumption that might not be the case.\n\nTherefore, I choose:\n\n(a) Julie might join a club or group that interests her.",
