Additionally, the fact that he was uncomfortable with wet pants and didn't get the job implies that he was aware of the importance of presenting himself well.

The passage doesn't mention any other factors that would prevent the protagonist from asking again, so it's reasonable to assume that they would try to persuade their parents.\n\nThe key difference between the two options is the mention of an \"emotional connection\" in option (b).

This suggests that they were exhausted from their busy day.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n(a) The protagonist would likely sleep in or rest the next day.\n(b) The protagonist would likely sleep in or rest the next day because they were exhausted from their busy day and needed to recover.\n\nBoth options suggest that the protagonist would likely sleep in or rest the next day. However, option (b) provides a clear reason for why they would do so - because they were exhausted from their busy day and needed to recover.\n\nGiven the context of the passage, it's more likely that the protagonist would sleep in or rest the next day because of their exhaustion. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(b) The protagonist would likely sleep in or rest the next day because they were exhausted from their busy day and needed to recover.",

This is a reasonable assumption, as people often frame memorabilia to keep them safe and display them proudly.\n\nOption (b) adds a crucial detail: \"because it was signed by his favorite wrestler.\" This additional information highlights the significance of the autographed shirt to Ben.

Sent many beautiful pictures to his friends\n\nBased on this information, we can infer that Yannick is:\n\n* Interested in sharing his experiences with his friends\n* Willing to step out of his comfort zone (going up the Empire State building despite fearing heights)\n* Enthusiastic about exploring new places (visiting New York City)\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(a) Yannick would likely visit other iconic landmarks in New York City and send pictures to his friends.\n\nThis option is a direct extension of Yannick's behavior so far. He's already visited one iconic landmark (Empire State building) and sent pictures to his friends. It's reasonable to assume he would continue to explore other landmarks and share his experiences with his friends.\n\n(b) Yannick would likely visit other iconic landmarks in New York City and send pictures to his friends because he enjoys photography as a hobby.\n\nThis option adds an additional assumption that Yannick enjoys photography as a hobby. While it's possible, there's no evidence in the passage to support this claim. We only know that he sent \"many beautiful pictures\" to his friends, but that could be because he's enthusiastic about sharing his experiences, not necessarily because he's a photography enthusiast.\n\nSo, based on the passage, I would select option (a) Yannick would likely visit other iconic landmarks in New York City and send pictures to his friends.",
