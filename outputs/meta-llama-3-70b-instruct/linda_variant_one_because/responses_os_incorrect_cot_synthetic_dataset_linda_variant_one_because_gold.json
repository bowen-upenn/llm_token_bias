This suggests that the policeman has some suspicion or evidence that led them to stop the protagonist.\n\nThe policeman then tells the protagonist that they cannot walk on that street anymore.

Given the context, it's possible that the protagonist might feel their rights were violated, especially if they were stopped without sufficient cause or if the policeman's behavior was unjustified.\n\nTherefore, I choose option (b) The protagonist would likely speak with a lawyer because he believes his rights were violated when the policeman stopped him from walking down the street.",

However, option (b) provides an additional reason for why Donald might continue tanning, which is to maintain his unique appearance.\n\nBut is this reason necessarily true? We don't have any information in the passage that suggests Donald wants to stand out in his social circle because of his orange-like skin tone. In fact, it's more likely that his friends are concerned about his skin tone because it's unhealthy or unnatural-looking.\n\nTherefore, I think the more likely option is:\n\n(a) Donald likely continues tanning despite his friends' concerns.\n\nThis option is more straightforward and doesn't make any additional assumptions about Donald's motivations.",

This suggests that they were exhausted from their busy day.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n(a) The protagonist would likely sleep in or rest the next day.\n(b) The protagonist would likely sleep in or rest the next day because they were exhausted from their busy day and needed to recover.\n\nBoth options suggest that the protagonist would likely sleep in or rest the next day. However, option (b) provides a clear reason for why they would do so - because they were exhausted from their busy day and needed to recover.\n\nGiven the context of the passage, it's more likely that the protagonist would sleep in or rest the next day because of their exhaustion. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(b) The protagonist would likely sleep in or rest the next day because they were exhausted from their busy day and needed to recover.",

This is a reasonable assumption, as people often frame memorabilia to keep them safe and display them proudly.\n\nOption (b) adds a crucial detail: \"because it was signed by his favorite wrestler.\" This additional information highlights the significance of the autographed shirt to Ben.

It's reasonable to assume he would continue to explore other landmarks and share his experiences with his friends.\n\n(b) Yannick would likely visit other iconic landmarks in New York City and send pictures to his friends because he enjoys photography as a hobby.\n\nThis option adds an additional assumption that Yannick enjoys photography as a hobby. While it's possible, there's no evidence in the passage to support this claim. We only know that he sent \"many beautiful pictures\" to his friends, but that could be because he's enthusiastic about sharing his experiences, not necessarily because he's a photography enthusiast.\n\nSo, based on the passage, I would select option (a) Yannick would likely visit other iconic landmarks in New York City and send pictures to his friends.",
