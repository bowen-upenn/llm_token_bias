This is a straightforward and plausible scenario.\n\nOption (b) adds additional information about the protagonist feeling exhausted after a long week of intense physical training. While this additional context makes the scenario more specific and detailed, it doesn't necessarily make it more probable than option (a).\n\nIn fact, option (b) assumes additional information that isn't present in the original passage, which only mentions the commander telling the men to break and the men taking a well-needed rest. We don't know anything about the protagonist's feelings or experiences prior to this moment.\n\nTherefore, I would select option (a) as the more likely scenario.",

To determine this, we need to compare the two options.\n\nOption (a) states that Tom would arrange to pick up the furniture he purchased on Craigslist.\n\nOption (b) states that Tom would arrange to pick up the furniture he purchased on Craigslist because he was eager to use it to furnish his new apartment.\n\nNotice that option (b) includes all the information from option (a), plus additional information about Tom's motivation (he was eager to use it to furnish his new apartment).\n\nIn general, when we add more specific details to a scenario, it becomes less likely. This is because the additional details provide more constraints, making the scenario more specific and less probable.\n\nIn this case, option (a) is a more general statement, simply stating that Tom would arrange to pick up the furniture. This is a straightforward and expected outcome, given that Tom purchased the furniture on Craigslist.\n\nOption (b), on the other hand, adds the additional detail about Tom's motivation, which makes the scenario more specific and less likely.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Tom would arrange to pick up the furniture he purchased on Craigslist.",
