This suggests that Ben is a big fan of wrestling and values the memory of meeting his favorite wrestler.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n(a) Ben might frame the autographed shirt to preserve the memory.\n(b) Ben might frame the autographed shirt to preserve the memory because he recently learned how to cook Italian cuisine.\n\nOption (b) seems unrelated to the context. There's no connection between learning to cook Italian cuisine and framing an autographed shirt. It's a random piece of information that doesn't add any relevance to the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, option (a) makes perfect sense. Ben is a big fan, and getting the shirt autographed is a special moment for him. Framing the shirt would be a natural way to preserve the memory and showcase his fandom.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Ben might frame the autographed shirt to preserve the memory.",
