This means Kevin was motivated to dry the dishes as fast as possible.\n\nWe also know that Kevin got angry while waiting for Laura to wash the last dish.

Kevin is frustrated with the delay, so it's likely that he would complain to Laura about how slowly she's washing the dishes.\n\nOption (b) adds an extra factor that isn't mentioned in the original scenario. While it's possible that Kevin might have plans to meet his friends later, this isn't mentioned in the original story, and it's not a necessary factor to explain Kevin's frustration.\n\nTherefore, I choose option (a) as the more likely outcome.",

This suggests that Donald values his appearance and may be motivated to continue tanning despite his friends' concerns.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n(a) Donald likely continues tanning despite his friends' concerns.\n\nThis option is a direct consequence of Donald's behavior and his friends' concerns. It's a plausible scenario based on the information provided.\n\n(b) Donald likely continues tanning despite his friends' concerns because he enjoys collecting rare stamps.\n\nThis option adds an unrelated factor (collecting rare stamps) to explain why Donald continues tanning. There is no connection between tanning and collecting rare stamps, and this factor doesn't seem to be relevant to the situation.\n\nBased on this analysis, I would choose option (a) as the more likely scenario. The correct answer is (a) Donald likely continues tanning despite his friends' concerns.",

This suggests that Paul enjoys playing with his hermit crab.\n\nThe question asks which is more likely: (a) Paul would play with his hermit crab, or (b) Paul would play with his hermit crab because it was raining outside.\n\nOption (a) is a more general statement that Paul would play with his hermit crab, which is supported by the passage.\n\nOption (b) adds a specific condition, \"because it was raining outside\", which is not mentioned in the passage. While it's possible that Paul might play with his hermit crab on a rainy day, we don't have enough information to conclude that.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) Paul would play with his hermit crab.",

It's a random fact that doesn't contribute to the likelihood of Ben framing the autographed shirt.\n\nOn the other hand, option (a) makes perfect sense.
