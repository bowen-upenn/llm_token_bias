Kevin is getting angry while waiting for Laura to wash the last dish, which implies that he's frustrated with the pace of her washing. It's likely that he would express this frustration by complaining to Laura about how slow she's going.\n\nOption (b) adds an extra reason for Kevin's complaint, which is not mentioned in the original scenario.
