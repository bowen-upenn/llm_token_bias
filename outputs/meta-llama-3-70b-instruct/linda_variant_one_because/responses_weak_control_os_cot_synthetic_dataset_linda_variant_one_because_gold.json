However, this additional detail doesn't change the fact that Ben might frame the shirt to preserve the memory.\n\nIn reality, option (b) is a conjunction of two events: \"Ben might frame the autographed shirt to preserve the memory\" and \"it was signed by his favorite wrestler\". The probability of a conjunction is always less than or equal to the probability of the individual events.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Ben might frame the autographed shirt to preserve the memory.\n\nBy choosing option (a), we are considering the probability of Ben framing the shirt to preserve the memory, without any additional conditions. This probability is higher than the probability of Ben framing the shirt to preserve the memory because it was signed by his favorite wrestler.",

Option (a) states that Yannick would likely visit other iconic landmarks in New York City and send pictures to his friends.\n\nThis seems like a reasonable assumption, given that Yannick has already shown an interest in exploring NYC and sharing his experiences with his friends.\n\n3. Option (b) adds an additional detail, stating that Yannick would likely visit other iconic landmarks in New York City and send pictures to his friends **because he enjoys photography as a hobby**.\n\nWhile it's possible that Yannick enjoys photography, we don't have any direct evidence to support this claim. In fact, the original story only mentions that Yannick sent pictures to his friends as a way to update them, not because he's a photography enthusiast.\n\nGiven this, I would choose option (a) as the more likely scenario. The additional detail in option (b) makes the statement more specific, but it also reduces the probability of the event occurring.\n\nSo, my answer is: (a) Yannick would likely visit other iconic landmarks in New York City and send pictures to his friends.",
