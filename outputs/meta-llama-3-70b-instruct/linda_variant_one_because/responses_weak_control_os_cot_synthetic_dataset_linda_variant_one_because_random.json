This suggests that Ken might be motivated to make a change, such as starting a diet or buying new clothes that fit better.\n\nNow, let's look at the two options:\n\n* Option (a) is a direct consequence of the situation described in the story. It's a plausible and logical outcome.\n* Option (b) adds an additional detail that is not related to the story. The fact that Ken enjoys watching science fiction movies is not relevant to his decision to start a diet or buy new clothes that fit better.\n\nGiven this analysis, I conclude that:\n\nThe correct answer is (a) Ken might start a diet or buy new clothes that fit better.\n\nThe addition of the irrelevant detail in option (b) makes it less likely than option (a), which is a more direct and logical consequence of the story.",
