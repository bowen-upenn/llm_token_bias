He then used his compass to find his way back to the campsite. \n\nNow, considering this experience, what would Ben likely do to avoid getting lost again?\n\nIt's reasonable to assume that Ben would want to avoid going through the same frightening experience again. Therefore, he would likely take measures to ensure he doesn't wander off too far again.\n\nThe question is, what motivates Ben to take these measures? Is it just a general desire to avoid getting lost, or is it also because he's worried about causing distress to his family?\n\nGiven the context of the story, it's likely that Ben is not just concerned about himself, but also about the potential impact of his actions on his family. If he gets lost again, it would likely cause worry and distress to his family members.\n\nSo, taking all this into account, I would choose:\n\n(b) Ben would likely check his compass frequently to ensure he does not wander off too far again because he is worried about getting lost and causing distress to his family.",
