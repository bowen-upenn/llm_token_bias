He might just want to enjoy the music or support his colleagues in the industry.\n\nTherefore, I would choose option (a) as the more likely scenario: Tony would attend a music concert.",

In other words, option (b) is a more detailed explanation of why Sam might choose to open a new account with a different bank.\n\nGiven this, I would argue that option (a) is the more likely scenario. The fact that Sam wants to open a new account with a different bank implies that he wants to avoid the issues he experienced with his previous account, which includes avoiding overdraft fees.\n\nSo, my answer is:\n(a) Sam would open a new bank account with a different bank.",

While this is a plausible reason, it's not necessarily the only reason or even the primary reason why Tommy would continue watching.\n\nGiven that option (a) is a more general statement that is directly supported by the information provided, I would choose:\n\n(a) Tommy would continue watching his new favorite shows.\n\nThis option is more likely because it's a simpler and more direct consequence of Tommy growing to like the shows.",

This is a general statement that implies the protagonist will help his wife with grilling.\n\nOption (b) adds more details to option (a). It not only states that the protagonist will assist or support his wife but also provides the motivation behind it - so that she feels more confident and enjoys grilling various dishes.\n\nSince option (b) includes all the information provided in option (a) and adds more context, it seems like a more specific and detailed description of the situation. However, in this case, the correct answer is actually option (a).\n\nThe reason is that option (a) is a more general statement that encompasses all possible reasons why the protagonist might assist or support his wife in her grilling endeavors. Option (b) is a more specific scenario that assumes a particular motivation for the protagonist's actions. While option (b) might be true, it's not necessarily the only possible reason why the protagonist would assist or support his wife.\n\nTherefore, I select option (a) as the correct answer.",
