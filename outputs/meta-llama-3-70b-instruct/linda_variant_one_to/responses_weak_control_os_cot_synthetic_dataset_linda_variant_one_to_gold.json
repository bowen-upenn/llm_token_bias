It's a straightforward statement about his behavior.\n\n(b) James would likely replace his toothbrush regularly to ensure that it always remained effective at preventing cavities.\n\nThis option adds an additional reason or motivation for James' behavior: he wants to prevent cavities. While this reason is plausible, it's not necessary to assume this motivation to conclude that James replaces his toothbrush regularly.\n\nGiven the scenario, it's clear that James is concerned about his teeth and would likely take care of them. Therefore, the more probable option is:\n\n(a) James would likely replace his toothbrush regularly.\n\nThe added detail in option (b) makes it a conjunction of two events, which can make it seem more specific and plausible, but it's actually less probable than the simpler statement in option (a).",

Option (a) states that Kendall would regularly water and tend to her garden.\n3. This is a very reasonable assumption, given that she put in a lot of effort to set up the garden and wants it to thrive.\n\nNow, let's look at option (b):\n\n1. Option (b) adds an additional condition to option (a), stating that Kendall would tend to her garden to ensure it attracts butterflies and hummingbirds.\n2. While it's possible that Kendall might want to attract butterflies and hummingbirds, this additional condition doesn't necessarily follow from the initial information.\n\nHere's the key point: option (b) is a conjunction of two events: Kendall tends to her garden, and she does so to attract butterflies and hummingbirds. The probability of this conjunction is lower than the probability of just one of the events (Kendall tends to her garden).\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Kendall would regularly water and tend to her garden.\n\nBy avoiding the conjunction fallacy, we recognize that the probability of the simpler event (tending to the garden) is higher than the probability of the more specific and complex event (tending to the garden to attract butterflies and hummingbirds).",

The conjunction fallacy occurs when we overestimate the probability of a conjunctive event (an event with multiple conditions) compared to the probability of one of its individual components.\n\nIn this case, option (b) is a conjunctive event: it requires two conditions to be true - Tom tells the story of how he got his scar AND he does so to impress his friends during a gathering.\n\nOption (a), on the other hand, only requires one condition to be true - Tom tells the story of how he got his scar.\n\nSince the probability of the conjunctive event (b) is always less than or equal to the probability of one of its individual components (a), the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Tom would likely tell the story of how he got his scar.\n\nIn other words, it's more likely that Tom would tell the story of how he got his scar in general, rather than specifically telling it to impress his friends during a gathering.",

It's a broad statement that doesn't specify any particular reason or context.\n\n(b) Jodie might recommend the cleaners to others or rehire them in the future to remove a grape juice stain.\n\nThis option is a more specific statement that adds an additional detail about the context of the recommendation or rehiring. It's a conjunction of two events: Jodie recommending/rehiring the cleaners and the specific reason being to remove a grape juice stain.\n\nThe key insight here is that the added detail in option (b) doesn't increase the probability of the event.
