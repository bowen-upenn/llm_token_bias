This is a plausible action for someone who wants to relieve stiffness, and it doesn't require any additional context.\n\nOption (b) adds an additional reason for Kate to stretch or go for a walk, which is to prepare for a morning meeting.

However, he quit the job due to stress.\n\nNow, the question is, what is more likely to happen next?\n\nSince Ray still wants a new computer, it's likely that he will look for ways to earn or save money for it. The fact that he quit his previous job due to stress suggests that he might look for a less stressful job or alternative ways to earn or save money.\n\nOption (b) adds a specific detail about a \"powerful gaming setup,\" but there is no mention of gaming in the original story. Therefore, it's not necessarily relevant to Ray's motivation.\n\nBased on the information provided, I choose:\n\n(a) Ray might start looking for a less stressful job or explore alternative ways to earn or save money for the computer.",

Option (a) is more general, stating that Adam would enjoy the attention and reactions from his peers, without specifying what the attention is about. Option (b) is more specific, stating that Adam would enjoy the attention and reactions from his peers **to his new haircut**.\n\nGiven the context, it's more likely that Adam would enjoy the attention and reactions specifically because of his new haircut, which is a significant change from his previous long hair. Therefore, I choose:\n\n(b) Adam would likely enjoy the attention and reactions from his peers to his new haircut.",
