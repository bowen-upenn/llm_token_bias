Increasing the reward is a straightforward way to encourage Rick to start flossing again. Option (b) adds an additional reason (avoiding further dental issues like gingivitis), but it's not necessary to motivate Marty's decision.

This is a straightforward continuation of the existing habit described in the scenario. It's a simple and plausible extension of the daily pattern.\n\nOption (b) adds an additional factor, stating that the protagonist eats junk food to gain comfort from their stressful day at work. While it's possible that the protagonist might be stressed at work and use junk food as a coping mechanism, this information is not present in the original scenario. The scenario only mentions the temptation of junk food in the refrigerator, without providing any context about the protagonist's work life or stress levels.\n\nBased on the information provided, I would choose option (a) The protagonist would continue eating junk food. This option is more likely because it's a direct continuation of the established habit, without introducing any additional factors that aren't mentioned in the scenario.",

This might be disappointing, but it's a common experience when building sand castles near the ocean.\n\nGiven their initial enthusiasm and investment in building the sand castle, it's likely that they would want to start again.
