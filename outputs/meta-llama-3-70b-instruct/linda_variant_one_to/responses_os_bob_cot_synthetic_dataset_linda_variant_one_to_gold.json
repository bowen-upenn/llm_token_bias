Option (b) is a more specific statement, stating that Jordan would continue wearing the new pants to work.\n\nSince we don't have any information about Jordan's work or whether he even has a job, we can't assume that he would wear the new pants to work.

He hears wolves howling in the distance, which could be a threat to his sheep. He investigates the noise and sees a wolf, so he shoots his rifle at it.\n\nConsidering this sequence of events, it's clear that Joe's primary motivation is to protect his sheep from the wolves. The fact that he shoots his rifle at the wolf suggests that he's taking action to defend his sheep.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n(a) Joe would protect his sheep from the wolves.\n(b) Joe would protect his sheep from the wolves to prevent them from getting hurt.\n\nBoth options are similar, but option (b) adds a specific reason why Joe would protect his sheep - to prevent them from getting hurt. However, we can infer this reason from the context of the story, so option (a) is already implicit that Joe is protecting his sheep to prevent harm.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Joe would protect his sheep from the wolves.",

This is a reasonable assumption, given her initial effort and investment in creating the garden. It's likely that she would want to maintain and care for it.\n\nOption (b) adds a specific detail, stating that she would tend to her garden to ensure it attracts butterflies and hummingbirds. While this is possible, it's a more specific and nuanced goal compared to simply wanting to maintain a healthy garden.\n\nBased on the information provided, I think the more likely option is:\n\n(a) Kendall would regularly water and tend to her garden.\n\nThis option is more general and aligns with the initial effort and investment Kendall put into creating the garden.",

The crowd is pointing and laughing, and the candidate is initially confused.\n\nIn this situation, it's likely that the candidate would want to address the unexpected event to regain the audience's attention and composure. Simply continuing with the speech without acknowledging the bird's presence (option a) might come across as insensitive or oblivious to the audience's reaction.\n\nOn the other hand, acknowledging the bird's presence and making light of the situation (option b) would show the candidate's ability to think on their feet, be adaptable, and connect with the audience on a more personal level.\n\nTherefore, I choose option (b) The protagonist would likely continue with the speech while acknowledging the bird's presence to make light of the situation.",

Tom might want to share the story to:\n\n* Relate to others who might have had similar experiences\n* Show his resilience and ability to overcome adversity\n* Simply because it's a unique and memorable event in his life\n\nOption (b) adds an additional motivation, implying that Tom would tell the story specifically to impress his friends.

Why? Because Mark has already demonstrated that he sets specific goals for himself (in this case, doing ten pull-ups) and works towards achieving them. It's likely that he would set a new, more challenging goal for himself once he's achieved his current target. In this case, aiming for twenty pull-ups is a natural progression.\n\nSo, my answer is: (b) Mark would continue training to increase his pull-up count beyond ten to achieve a new goal of twenty pull-ups.",
