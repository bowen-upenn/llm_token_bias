While it's possible that Jordan might wear the new pants to a concert, it's not necessarily a guaranteed outcome.\n\nBased on the information provided, I would choose option (a) as the more likely scenario.

Option (a) directly addresses this goal by suggesting that the boy will try to communicate the correct information (i.e., that he wants pudding).

Then, Travis informed her she couldn't smoke in the car. This tells us that Travis is willing to interact with the woman, at least to some extent.\n\nNow, let's look at the two options:\n\n(a) Travis would continue driving while trying to make conversation with the woman.\n(b) Travis would continue driving while trying to make conversation with the woman to learn a new language.\n\nOption (a) is a relatively normal and plausible scenario. Travis might try to make small talk with the woman to be friendly or to pass the time during the drive.\n\nOption (b) is less likely. While it's possible that Travis might try to make conversation with the woman, it's unlikely that his goal would be to learn a new language. This scenario seems quite specific and unusual.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Travis would continue driving while trying to make conversation with the woman.",
