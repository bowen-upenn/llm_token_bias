It's a unique and memorable event.\n\nNow, let's consider the two options:\n\n(a) Tom would likely tell the story of how he got his scar.\n(b) Tom would likely tell the story of how he got his scar to check if anyone needed help with their computer.\n\nOption (b) seems unrelated to the event that caused the scar. There's no connection between the scar and checking if someone needs help with their computer.\n\nOn the other hand, option (a) is a natural consequence of having a distinctive scar. People often ask about scars, and it's common for the person to share the story behind it.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Tom would likely tell the story of how he got his scar.",

She finally found one, and they did a really good job!\n\nNow, we need to decide which option is more likely:\n\n(a) Jodie might recommend the cleaners to others or rehire them in the future.\n(b) Jodie might recommend the cleaners to others or rehire them in the future to plan her next vacation.\n\nIt's clear that Jodie was happy with the cleaning service, so it's likely she might recommend them to others or use them again in the future (option a).\n\nHowever, there's no connection between the cleaning service and planning a vacation (option b). The passage only talks about the cleaning service, not about Jodie's vacation plans.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Jodie might recommend the cleaners to others or rehire them in the future.",

Now that he's achieved it, what's the most likely next step?\n\nOption (a) suggests that Mark would continue training to increase his pull-up count beyond ten. This makes sense, as Mark has already demonstrated his commitment to improving his physical fitness. It's likely that he would want to continue challenging himself and pushing his limits.\n\nOption (b) adds an unrelated goal - learning to play the guitar. While it's possible that Mark might be interested in learning to play the guitar, there's no evidence in the prompt to suggest that this is a goal of his. It's unlikely that Mark would suddenly switch his focus from physical fitness to learning a musical instrument.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Mark would continue training to increase his pull-up count beyond ten.",
