This is a plausible response, as the candidate might make a lighthearted comment about the unexpected visitor and then refocus on their message.\n\nOption (b) adds an additional detail, stating that the candidate would discuss their upcoming policy changes. While it's possible that the candidate might try to pivot to their policy agenda, it's less likely that they would seamlessly transition to a specific topic like policy changes in the midst of the distraction.\n\nGiven the unexpected interruption, it's more likely that the candidate would initially focus on addressing the situation and regaining the audience's attention before proceeding with their speech. Therefore, I choose:\n\n(a) The protagonist would likely continue with the speech while acknowledging the bird's presence.",
