Now, we need to determine which option is more likely.\n\nOption (a) suggests that Mark would continue training to increase his pull-up count beyond ten. This is a natural progression, given his previous goal-oriented behavior. It's reasonable to assume that Mark would want to continue challenging himself and improving his physical abilities.\n\nOption (b) adds an unrelated factor: learning to play the guitar. While it's possible that Mark might want to learn to play the guitar, there's no connection between this goal and his previous goal of doing ten pull-ups. The additional information about learning to play the guitar seems unrelated and unnecessary.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Mark would continue training to increase his pull-up count beyond ten.",
