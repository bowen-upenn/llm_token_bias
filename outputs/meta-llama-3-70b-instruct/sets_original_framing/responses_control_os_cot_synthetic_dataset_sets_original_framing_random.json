Some emergency responders receive training specifically in hazardous materials containment. (Premise)\n3. Consequently, it follows that a certain group of firefighters is likely trained in managing hazardous materials. (Conclusion)\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure of the argument:\n\n* The first premise states that firefighters are primary responders in emergencies, but it doesn't mention anything about hazardous materials containment.\n* The second premise states that some emergency responders receive training in hazardous materials containment, but it doesn't specify whether these responders are firefighters or not.\n* The conclusion jumps to the assumption that a certain group of firefighters is likely trained in managing hazardous materials, but there is no logical connection between the premises to support this claim.\n\nThe problem is that the second premise only talks about some emergency responders, which may or may not include firefighters. We can't assume that the subset of emergency responders who receive training in hazardous materials containment overlaps with the group of firefighters mentioned in the first premise.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: No, this argument is not logically sound.",
