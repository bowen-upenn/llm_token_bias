The probability of option (b) is therefore the product of the probabilities of events 1 and 2.\n\nSince event 1 (Canelo loses his next fight) is a necessary condition for event 2 (Canelo wins the rematch with a knockout) to occur, the probability of event 2 is conditional on event 1 happening.

While the Church has moved away from supporting capital punishment, it's possible that an encyclical might acknowledge the complexity of the issue and emphasize the importance of mercy and forgiveness, even if it ultimately argues against the use of capital punishment.\n\nSo, my answer is:\n\n(b) The encyclical will support capital punishment but emphasize mercy and forgiveness as central doctrines of the Church.",

Given his historical record, I'd argue that option (b) is more likely.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. Adenauer was a skilled diplomat and politician who played a crucial role in rebuilding Germany's international relations. He was instrumental in securing Germany's membership in the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), the precursor to the European Union, and establishing close ties with the United States.\n2. Despite the challenges of post-war reconstruction, Adenauer's government focused on reviving the domestic economy. He implemented policies that promoted economic growth, such as the \"Social Market Economy\" concept, which combined free-market principles with social welfare policies. This approach helped Germany experience rapid economic growth, often referred to as the \"Wirtschaftswunder\" (Economic Miracle).\n\nGiven Adenauer's track record, it's more likely that he would successfully revive the domestic economy while also making efforts to improve Germany's international relations, even if the latter might be a more challenging task.\n\nSo, my answer is: (b) He fails to improve Germany's international relations but successfully revives the domestic economy.",

However, it's less likely that Michael's continued investment would be enough to turn the startup around and lead it to success.\n\nTherefore, based on the probabilities, I would select:\n\n(a) The startup fails within the first year.\n\nThis option is more likely because it's a more common outcome for startups, and it doesn't rely on the additional condition of Michael's continued investment leading to success.",

There are many factors that contribute to a movie's commercial success, such as marketing, audience preferences, and competition. So, option (b) is a more specific and restrictive scenario than option (a).\n\nTherefore, I select:\n\n(a) The movie wins no awards.",

        "init_model_answer": "Let's break it down step by step.\n\nJames Catlett Marshall, also known as George C. Marshall, was a renowned American statesman and diplomat who played a crucial role in shaping post-World War II international relations. He was a key figure in the development of the Marshall Plan, which helped to rebuild war-torn Europe.\n\nIf he were to come back to modern times to work on international policy again, it's likely that he would face significant challenges in understanding contemporary geopolitics. The world has undergone tremendous changes since his time, with the rise of new global powers, the evolution of international institutions, and the emergence of complex issues like climate change, terrorism, and cybersecurity.\n\nGiven these challenges, I think option (a) is a more likely scenario: **(a) He struggles to understand contemporary geopolitics.**\n\nWhile Marshall was an exceptional diplomat and strategist in his time, it's unlikely that he would be able to quickly grasp the intricacies of modern geopolitics without a significant period of learning and adaptation. His experience and knowledge, although valuable, would need to be updated to address the complexities of the 21st century.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that, with his exceptional diplomatic skills and experience, he might be able to eventually broker a groundbreaking international agreement, as suggested in option (b). But I think this would require a significant amount of time and effort to get up to speed with contemporary geopolitics.\n\nSo, my answer is: **(a) He struggles to understand contemporary geopolitics.**",

While Khrushchev might have received applause and approval from some delegations, a standing ovation from all present is unlikely, especially considering the Cold War tensions and ideological differences between the Soviet Union and many other UN member states.\n\nOn the other hand, option (b) is a famous incident that actually occurred during Khrushchev's speech at the UN General Assembly in 1960. He did indeed remove his shoe and bang it on the table to protest a speech by Filipino delegate Lorenzo Sumulong.\n\nSo, my answer is:\n\n(b) He will receive a standing ovation from all present but then dramatically remove his shoe and bang it on the table.",
