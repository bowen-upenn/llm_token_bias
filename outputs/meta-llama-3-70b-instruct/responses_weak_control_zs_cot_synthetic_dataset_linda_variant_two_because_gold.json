Both options start with \"In BP ad, Hayward promises...\"\n3. The difference between the two options is the additional phrase in (b): \"...because it aligns with our commitment to transparency and accountability.\"\n\nNow, here's the key insight: adding more details to a statement doesn't make it more likely. In fact, the more specific and detailed a statement is, the less likely it becomes.\n\nSo, in this case, option (a) is simply a promise from Hayward, while option (b) adds an extra reason for the promise. This extra detail makes option (b) less likely than option (a).\n\nTherefore, I select:\n\n(a) In BP ad, Hayward promises, \"We will get this done.\"",
