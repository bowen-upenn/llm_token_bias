To calculate the probability of this sequence, we need to multiply the probabilities of each individual spin:\n(3/8) \u00d7 (3/8) \u00d7 (3/8) \u00d7 (3/8) \u00d7 (5/8) \u00d7 (5/8) \u00d7 (5/8) \u00d7 (5/8) \u00d7 (5/8) \u00d7 (3/8)\n\n(b) GGGGRRRGG: This sequence has 4 consecutive greens, followed by 6 consecutive reds, and then 2 greens. Again, we multiply the probabilities:\n(3/8) \u00d7 (3/8) \u00d7 (3/8) \u00d7 (3/8) \u00d7 (5/8) \u00d7 (5/8) \u00d7 (5/8) \u00d7 (5/8) \u00d7 (5/8) \u00d7 (3/8) \u00d7 (3/8)\n\n(c) GGGGRRRG: This sequence has 4 consecutive greens, followed by 6 consecutive reds, and then 1 green. Once more, we multiply the probabilities:\n(3/8) \u00d7 (3/8) \u00d7 (3/8) \u00d7 (3/8) \u00d7 (5/8) \u00d7 (5/8) \u00d7 (5/8) \u00d7 (5/8) \u00d7 (5/8) \u00d7 (3/8)\n\nHere's the key observation: all three sequences have the same pattern of 4 greens followed by 6 reds. The only difference is in the last spin, where they have either 1 green or 2 greens.\n\nSince the probability of getting a green on a single spin is 3/8, and the probability of getting two greens in a row is (3/8) \u00d7 (3/8), we can see that option (b) GGGGRRRGG has a lower probability than options (a) and (c).\n\nTherefore, I would prefer to bet on either option (a) GGGGRRRRG or option",
