This suggests a potentially tense and provocative situation.\n\nGiven this context, it's likely that the White House would respond to the incident and express concern or objection to Beijing.\n\nOption (a) simply states that the White House said the incident was a provocation and raised an objection with Beijing. This is a plausible response, but it's relatively vague.\n\nOption (b) adds more context to the White House's response, suggesting that the objection was raised to emphasize the US commitment to maintaining freedom of navigation in the region.

This implies that the meeting is focused on finding a peaceful solution to the crisis in Syria.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n(a) 116 were killed around Syria on Sunday, an opposition group reports\n(b) 116 were killed around Syria on Sunday, an opposition group reports so that the violence could be emphasized in negotiations.\n\nOption (a) simply states a fact about the number of people killed in Syria, which is a tragic but common occurrence in a war-torn country.\n\nOption (b) adds a motive to the report, suggesting that the opposition group is highlighting the violence to emphasize its importance in the negotiations. While this is possible, it's not necessarily the most likely scenario.\n\nGiven the context of the meeting between diplomats and the envoy's emphasis on a political process to end the crisis, I think option (a) is more likely. The report of 116 people killed is simply a statement of fact, rather than being used as a bargaining chip in negotiations.\n\nSo, my answer is: (a) 116 were killed around Syria on Sunday, an opposition group reports.",

We know that Zack Brown started a Kickstarter to make potato salad with a goal of $10, but it has raised $11,000. This suggests that the project has gained significant attention and support.\n\nOption (a) states that donations have come from the UK, France, and Romania. Given the international reach of Kickstarter and the unexpected success of the project, it's plausible that people from different countries have contributed to the campaign.\n\nOption (b) adds an additional condition: that donations have come from these countries so that Zack can learn to make better potato salad. While it's possible that some donors might be motivated by this reason, it's unlikely to be the primary motivation for most donors. The project's humor and novelty are likely driving its popularity.\n\nTherefore, I choose option (a) as the more likely scenario:\n\n(a) Donations have come from the UK, France and Romania",

It suggests that France is able to navigate globalization in a way that preserves its cultural identity and promotes its economic competitiveness.

        "target_answer": "(a) Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel took the checkered flag at his home grand prix",
        "retry": false,
        "use_multi_agents": false,
        "init_model_answer": "Let's break it down.\n\nThe article mentions an incident where a cameraman, Paul Allen, was injured by a loose wheel during the German Grand Prix. It doesn't mention anything about Sebastian Vettel's victory or dedication to the injured cameraman.\n\nBased on this information, I would select:\n\n(a) Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel took the checkered flag at his home grand prix\n\nThis option is more likely because it's a simple statement about Vettel winning the race, which might have happened regardless of the incident with the cameraman. The second option (b) adds an extra detail about dedicating the victory to the injured cameraman, which is not mentioned in the article.",
