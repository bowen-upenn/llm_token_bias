The key to solving this problem is to calculate the probabilities of each sequence:\n\n1. We first need to establish the probability of rolling a fuchsia (F) face versus a cyan (C) face on this special eight-sided die:\n   - Probability of F (P(F)) = 5/8\n   - Probability of C (P(C)) = 3/8\n\n2. Next, we calculate the probabilities for each of the given sequences:\n   - Sequence (a) CCFFF:\n     - Probability = P(C) * P(C) * P(F) * P(F) * P(F)\n     - Calculation = (3/8) * (3/8) * (5/8) * (5/8) * (5/8)\n\n   - Sequence (b) CCCFFF:\n     - Probability = P(C) * P(C) * P(C) * P(F) * P(F) * P(F)\n     - Calculation = (3/8) * (3/8) * (3/8) * (5/8) * (5/8) * (5/8)\n\n   - Sequence (c) CCFFFF:\n     - Probability = P(C) * P(C) * P(F) * P(F) * P(F) * P(F)\n     - Calculation = (3/8) * (3/8) * (5/8) * (5/8) * (5/8) * (5/8)\n\n3.

Evaluation and Conclusion:\n   - Sequence (a) CCFFF has fewer cyans than sequence (c) CCFFFF and sequence (b) CCCFFF.\n   - While we can calculate exact probabilities, the relative ordering based on the count of less probable events (Cyan faces) is more straightforward. In this approach, fewer Cyan faces yield a higher probability of occurrence for the sequence.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis:\nAnswer: **(a) CCFFF** is the preferred sequence for betting because it has a higher occurrence probability, owing to a lower count of the less",

Let's break down the selections:\n\n- Sequence (a) VVVVOOO consists of 7 spins.\n- Sequence (b) VVOVOOO also consists of 7 spins.\n- Sequence (c) VVVOOO consists of only 6 spins.\n\nIn probabilistic terms, the fewer the number of events (spins) in a sequence, the higher the probability of that sequence occurring. This holds because the likelihood of any specific longer sequence appearing exactly as specifified decreases as the length of the sequence increases. Each additional spin in a sequence multiplies the probability of that sequence occurring by a new factor, which depends on the probabilities of landing on Orange or Violet in that particular spin.\n\nGiven specific counts on the spinner:\n- Orange (O) sections = 5\n- Violet (V) sections = 3\n\nFrom this, the probability of hitting Orange on any given spin = 5/8, and of hitting Violet = 3/8.\n\nThus, for any sequence, multiplying these probabilities for each respective outcome in the sequence gives us its overall probability.\n\nWhile full computation of each sequence's probability requires more detailed calculation, it's clear under the principle that shorter sequences (in number of spins) are statistically more likely to appear than longer ones in successive spins, because there are fewer events that each need to occur as specified.\n\nGiven (c) has the least number of spins (6 spins) compared to the sequences in (a) and (b) (each having 7 spins), the correct choice, based on probabilistic thinking, is:\n(c) VVVOOO.",
