        "init_model_answer": "Following the probabilistically correct approach and considering the conjunction fallacy, the correct choice between the two options given is:\n\n(a) Tom would arrange to pick up the furniture he purchased on Craigslist.\n\nThis option is more likely because it is a single event, and its probability supercedes that of a conjunction of events. The additional information in option (b) (because he was eager to use it to furnish his new apartment) introduces a second element that makes it a conjunction of events, which statistically reduces its probability compared to option (a).",
