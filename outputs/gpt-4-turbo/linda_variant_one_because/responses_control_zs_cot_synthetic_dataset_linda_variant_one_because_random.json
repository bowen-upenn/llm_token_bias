Option (b) describes a conjunction of two events \u2014 not only does Tom arrange to pick up the furniture he purchased on Craigslist, but this action is specifically motivated by his enjoyment of jazz music.\n\nFollowing the principle that the probability of a conjunction (two conditions both being true) is always less than or equal to the probability of any single constituent event, the likelihood of option (a) occurring is higher than the likelihood of both conditions in option (b) being true simultaneously.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n(a) Tom would meet to pick up the furniture he purchased on Craigslist.",
