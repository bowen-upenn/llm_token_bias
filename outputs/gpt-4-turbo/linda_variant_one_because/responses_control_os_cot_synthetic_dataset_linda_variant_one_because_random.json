Event B (rain later in the day) is not connected to the situation of thanking the nurse directly.\n\n3. **Understanding Conjunction Probability**: The probability of two events occurring together (A and B) is always less than or equal to the probability of either event happening individually. The conjunction of A and B (thanking the nurse because of expected rain) introduces an additional condition that doesn't logically influence the likelihood of Nina thanking the nurse.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n(a) Nina would likely thank the nurse for her kindness.\n\nThis choice focuses solely on the event related directly to the scenario presented, making it statistically more probable than the conjunction of thanking the nurse and an unrelated event (rain) in option (b).",
