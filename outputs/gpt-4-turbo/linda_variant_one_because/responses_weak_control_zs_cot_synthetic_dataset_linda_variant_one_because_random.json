It is solely concerned with the likelihood of Jamal taking the opportunity to improve his report.\n\nOption (b), on the other hand, is more specific and introduces an additional condition \u2014 his preference for library coffee \u2014 which must also be true for the statement to hold. This specificity makes it a conjunction of two conditions: Jamal improving his report, and his doing so because of the specific preference for coffee.\n\nAccording to probability theory (specifically, the conjunction rule), the probability of two events both occurring (in this case, Jamal deciding to revise the report and his preference for the coffee being the motivation) can never be greater than the probability of either event occurring individually. Therefore, adding the extra condition about the coffee preference only serves to potentially lower the probability of (b) being correct compared to (a).\n\nGiven this analysis, option (a) is more likely because it is simpler and less restrictive compared to option (b), which depends on the additional detail about Jamal\u2019s coffee preference. \n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n(a) Jamal would likely take the opportunity to improve his report before submitting it next week.",

Here\u2019s how to break it down:\n\n- Looking at option (a), it suggests that after experiencing his jeans tearing, Ken might start a diet or buy new clothes that fit better. This seems like a logical sequence of actions in response to the situation Ken faced, where his clothing no longer fits comfortably due to weight gain.\n\n- Option (b) adds an additional detail that Ken might take those actions \u201cbecause he enjoys watching science fiction...\" This is less likely as this added information is irrelevant to the scenario of his jeans tearing and his response to gaining weight.\n\nThe conjunction rule in probability states that the likelihood of two events happening together (in conjunction) is always less than or equal to the probability of either one happening alone. In this case, option (b) is a conjunction of two occurrences: taking action following the jeans incident, and his enjoyment of science fiction movies. The addition of an unrelated element (enjoyment of science fiction movies) does not make the scenario more probable, but rather stretches the likelihood.\n\nThus, the more likely scenario, based purely on the information given about the jeans incident, is (a) Ken might start a diet or buy new clothes that fit better.",
