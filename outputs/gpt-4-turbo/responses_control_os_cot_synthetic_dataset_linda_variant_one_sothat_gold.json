This outcome is the conjunction of two events: walking on the beach and the specific intention or effect on the repair.\n\nStep 2: Applying the Rule of Conjunction Probability\n- The probability of a single outcome happening (walking on the beach) is always greater than or equal to the probability of it happening with another specific condition or outcome (walking on the beach to benefit the condition of the repair).\n\nBased on probabilistic thinking:\n(a) Tracy would continue walking on the beach.\nThis option is more likely because it involves only one condition and does not include the additional specific intention or result related to the tie used in the repair.
