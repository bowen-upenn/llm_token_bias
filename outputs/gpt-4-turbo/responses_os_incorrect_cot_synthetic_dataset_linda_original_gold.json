Option (b) includes all elements of option (a) but adds another specific condition\u2014that he enjoys exploring photography as a hobby. The probability of two events both occurring ('A and B') is always less than or equal to the probability of either event occurring on its own ('A' or 'B').

Therefore, the probability of a person having one specific occupation (like being a lawyer, judge, or related worker) is generally higher than that of having the same occupation and also participating in a specific activity (like volunteering at historical reenactment events), due to the reduced likelihood that all specific conditions are met concurrently.\n\nIn Jennifer\u2019s case:\n- Statement (a) is a broad category covering her working as a lawyer, judge, or related worker.\n- Statement (b) combines this first condition with a second specific activity, volunteering at historical reenactment events.\n\nAccording to basic probability principles, the correct answer is:\n(a) Jennifer works as a lawyer, judge, or related worker.\n\nThis choice is statistically more probable because it imposes fewer specific conditions than option (b).
