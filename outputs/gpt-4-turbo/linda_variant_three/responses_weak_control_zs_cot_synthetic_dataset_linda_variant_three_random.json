The conjunction rule in probability states that specific conditions added together (conjunctions) are less likely than a single broader condition. Option (b) adds an extra specific condition (acute sensitivity to noise) to the condition in option (a), which makes (b) less likely than (a).",

        "init_model_answer": "The most likely scenario between the two presented options is:\n\n(b) Morgan also experiences dehydration.\n\nExplanation:\nDehydration is a common symptom associated with Gastroenteritis, due to fluid loss from vomiting and diarrhea. Sudden increase in nail growth rate, however, is not a typical side effect or symptom related to Gastroenteritis. Therefore, option (b) is more likely than option (a) because it includes only one plausible condition associated with Gastroenteritis, whereas option (a) includes an additional, less plausible condition, making it overall less likely. This follows the logic that the likelihood of two specific conditions occurring together (conjunction) is always equal to or less than the likelihood of one of them occurring alone.",
