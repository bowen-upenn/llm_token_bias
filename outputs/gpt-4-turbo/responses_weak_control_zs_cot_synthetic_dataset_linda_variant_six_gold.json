This is simply because there are more possible starting positions for a shorter sequence within the 20 spins, and each additional color in the sequence makes it statistically less likely to occur exactly as specified.

This makes sequences with more P's slightly more probable than those with more T's. The sequences are:\n   - (a) TPPT contains two P\u2019s and two T\u2019s.\n   - (b) TPTPT contains two P\u2019s and three T\u2019s.\n   - (c) PTPPT contains three P\u2019s and two T\u2019s.\n\n3. **Assessing probability**:\n   - **(a) TPPT**: This sequence has a balance of P\u2019s and T\u2019s, and is shorter than the others.\n   - **(b) TPTPT**: This sequence is the longest and contains an extra T, which is less frequent than P.\n   - **(c) PTPPT**: Although as long as (b), it has more P\u2019s, making it slightly more likely than (b) but still less likely than (a) due to its length.\n\nFrom this analysis, **(a) TPPT** is the best choice because it is the shortest sequence and maintains a balanced probability of occurrence of pinks and teals.

There are more opportunities for the sequence to start within 20 spins (the first spin of the sequence can start up to the 15th spin for a 6-spin sequence, but only up to the 14th for a 7-spin sequence).\n2. The sequence requires one fewer specific outcome, which increases its likelihood relative to longer sequences.\n\nConsidering this assessment, you should prefer to bet on the shortest sequence assuming equal probabilities of landing on green or fuchsia within the given sequences.
