Considering what is most likely between the two options provided involves the principle that a simpler, more straightforward statement tends to be more probable.\n\nOption (a), \"Marty would likely increase the reward to motivate Rick to floss,\" presents a direct, straightforward solution to the problem of motivating Rick, focusing solely on the incentive to encourage a desired behavior.\n\nOption (b), \"Marty would likely increase the reward to motivate Rick to floss to avoid further dental issues like gingivitis,\" introduces an additional specific reason (to avoid further dental issues like gingivitis) along with the solution. This makes option (b) a conjunction of two ideas: increasing the reward and targeting a specific consequence (gingivitis).\n\nIn probability theory, the probability of a conjunction (two events happening together) is never greater than the probability of either of the constituent events occurring alone. Therefore, the likelihood of just increasing the reward (Option (a)) is higher than the likelihood of increasing the reward specifically to avoid further dental issues like gingivitis, along with the motivation aspect (Option (b)).\n\nThe correct choice, based solely on the principle of likelihood and simplicity, is:\n(a) Marty would likely increase the reward to motivate Rick to floss.",

The likelihood of each option must be considered based on the information provided and common reasoning about probability.\n\nOption (a), James would likely replace his toothbrush regularly, is a simple statement about his behavior. It's consistent with having multiple toothbrushes and caring greatly for his dental health. It doesn't involve any specific reasoning beyond a general concern for oral hygiene.\n\nOption (b), James would likely replace his toothbrush regularly to ensure that it always remained effective at preventing cavities, adds a specific motive for replacing the toothbrush: to maintain its effectiveness at preventing cavities. While the motive fits the description of James caring deeply about his dental health, it is, in essence, a conjunction. This option ties together \"replacing his toothbrush regularly\" and \"ensuring it remains effective at preventing cavities.\"\n\nConsidering the problem logically, specifically in terms of probability, option (b) is a conjunction of two events: replacing the toothbrush and ensuring its effectiveness. According to probability theory, a conjunction (an \"and\" statement) is never more probable than any of its constituent parts alone. Therefore, the probability that James replaces his toothbrush regularly, and that he does it specifically to ensure it remains effective at preventing cavities, cannot be higher than the probability of James replacing his toothbrush for any reason (including simpler or even unknown reasons).\n\nThus, the more likely scenario, based solely on probability without additional specific evidence suggesting the conjunction, is:\n**(a) James would likely replace his toothbrush regularly.**",

Therefore, it adds an additional layer of specificity that is not present in option (a).\n\nThus, simply based on the likelihood of occurrence, it is statistically more probable that:\n(a) Striker would likely draw more maps or explore more advanced cartography.",
