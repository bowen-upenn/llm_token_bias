The basic principle is to identify sequences that are less repetitive and have better distribution between fuchsia (F) and white (W); this makes such a sequence more likely to appear across successive spins.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the constitution of sequences in terms of their length and distribution of fuchsia and white sectors:\n- Sequence (a) FFFWFFWFF has 9 spins containing 6 fuchsias and 3 whites.\n- Sequence (b) FFFFWFFWW has 9 spins containing 6 fuchsias and 3 whites.\n- Sequence (c) FFWFWFFWW also has 9 spins containing 5 fuchsias and 4 whites.\n\nTo maximize the likelihood of a sequence appearing:\n- **Variability and distribution:** A sequence that intersperses colors more might appear more frequently due to less strict repetition requirements. Thus, a sequence like (c), which seems more mixed and balanced between F and W, may have a higher chance.\n- **Probability calculation:** Assuming independent events, each spin has a 5/8 chance of landing on F and a 3/8 chance of landing on W. The overall probability of a specific sequence occurring involves multiplying the probabilities of each outcome in the sequence.\n   \n   Let's compute the probability for each sequence:\n   - For (a) and (b): (5/8)^6 * (3/8)^3\n   - For (c): (5/8)^5 * (3/8)^4\n\n   These computations yield:\n   - For (a) and (b): Approx. 0.0517578\n   - For (c): Approx. 0.0317383\n\nEven though the actual calculation reflects slightly higher absolute probabilities for sequences (a) and (b), considering practicality and pattern occurrence, sequence (c) presents a more varied and alternating pattern. This might allow it space to occur more frequently within the span of 20 spins, as it does not rely on longer uninterrupted streaks of fuchsia.\n\nThe choice:\n(c) FFWFWFFWW.\nThis is based on its balanced pattern which seems more likely to be repeated, despite a numerically lower theoretical probability, as it doesn't heavily cluster a single color which might be less likely in practical spins.",
