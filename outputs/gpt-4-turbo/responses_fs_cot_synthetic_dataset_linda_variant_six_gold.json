Let's analyze each option:\n\n(a) **VFFV**: This is a 4-letter sequence. The probability of spinning Violet (V) is 5/8, and Fuchsia (F) is 3/8. The probability of obtaining this particular sequence in four spins is (5/8) * (3/8) * (3/8) * (5/8). \n\n(b) **VFFFV**: This is a 5-letter sequence. The probability for this sequence is (5/8) * (3/8) * (3/8) * (3/8) * (5/8).\n\n(c) **VFVFV**: This is a 5-letter sequence as well. The probability is (5/8) * (3/8) * (5/8) * (3/8) * (5/8).\n\nThe calculations would show that shorter sequences generally tend to have higher probabilities of occurring purely due to the fewer number of spins involved. Therefore:\n\n- **VFFV (Option a)** is shorter (4 spins) than the other options which are each 5 spins long.\n- The inclusion of multiple Fuchsias in a row in options (b) and (c) also reduces their likelihood because the individual probability of Fuchsia (3/8) is less than that of Violet (5/8).\n\nHence, in terms of probability, **option (a) VFFV** is the preferable bet because it is shorter and has a simpler combination of lower probability events (Fuchsia) occurring only twice rather than more frequently as in other options.

First, let's consider the probability of landing on either a white (W) or hazel (H) sector:\n\n- There are 5 white sectors and 3 hazel sectors on the spinner, making a total of 8 sectors.\n- Probability of landing on a white sector (W) = 5/8.\n- Probability of landing on a hazel sector (H) = 3/8.\n\nNow, we calculate the probability of each sequence:\n1. Probability of sequence (a) WWWH:\n   - P(WWWH) = P(W) \u00d7 P(W) \u00d7 P(W) \u00d7 P(H) = (5/8) \u00d7 (5/8) \u00d7 (5/8) \u00d7 (3/8)\n   - P(WWWH) = 375/4096 \u2248 0.09155\n\n2. Probability of sequence (b) WWWHH:\n   - P(WWWHH) = P(W) \u00d7 P(W) \u00d7 P(W) \u00d7 P(H) \u00d7 P(H) = (5/8) \u00d7 (5/8) \u00d7 (5/8) \u00d7 (3/8) \u00d7 (3/8)\n   - P(WWWHH) = 1125/32768 \u2248 0.03436 \n\n3. Probability of sequence (c) WWWWH:\n   - P(WWWWH) = P(W) \u00d7 P(W) \u00d7 P(W) \u00d7 P(W) \u00d7 P(H) = (5/8) \u00d7 (5/8) \u00d7 (5/8) \u00d7 (5/8) \u00d7 (3/8)\n   - P(WWWWH) = 1875/32768 \u2248 0.05729\n\nFrom these calculations, the sequence (a) WWWH has the highest probability of occurring. Therefore, it is statistically more likely to occur in successive spins compared to the other two sequences.\n\nThus, the best option to bet on is:\n**(a) WWWH.**",

This is because there are fewer specific arrangements needed in a given number of spins to match the sequence precisely.\n\nComparing the options:\n- **Option (a) 'NHHNHHH'** is the shortest sequence with only 7 spins.

However, the probabilities need to be considered more carefully: with a greater number of consecutive cyan faces (which is rarer but feasible due to randomness), this chain might be slightly more unexpected but could still happen.\n\nFrom probability point of view, sequences with a distribution closer to the actual face distribution (five amber, three cyan) might seem more likely.
