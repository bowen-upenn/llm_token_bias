The key here is to recognize that the shorter a sequence, the more likely it is to appear in any given set of successive spins simply due to its brevity. Thus, in this context, you should select the option with the shortest sequence length for a higher probability of occurrence. Let's examine each option:\n\n(a) FAFFAFAA consists of 8 spins.\n(b) FAFAAAAA consists of 8 spins.\n(c) FAFAFAAA consists of 8 spins.\n\nSince all options are of the same length, we need to consider another aspect: the distribution of Ambers (A) and Fuchsias (F) on the spinner and in the sequences. Given that Amber sections are more probable than Fuchsia (5 Amber sections out of 8 total \u2013 so 5/8 probability for Amber, and 3/8 for Fuchsia), sequences containing more Ambers should theoretically have a higher chance of occurring.\n\nNow count the As and Fs:\n(a) 4 As and 4 Fs.\n(b) 6 As and 2 Fs.\n(c) 5 As and 3 Fs.\n\nSince option (b) has the most As (6 As) and fewer Fs (2 Fs) and considering the probabilities of As and Fs as derived from the spinner setup, option (b) should have a statistically higher probability of occurring than the other sequences. This is because the sequence maximizes the use of the more likely outcome (A), given its proportion on the spinner.\n\nHence, the correct choice, focusing purely on probabilistic grounds and considering the input conditions (more As), would be:\n(b) FAFAAAAA.",
