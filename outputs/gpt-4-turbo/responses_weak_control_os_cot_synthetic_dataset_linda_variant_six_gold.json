The general rule here is that shorter sequences are more likely to occur within a given number of spins than longer sequences, because there are more potential starting points and fewer required successive matches.\n\nLet's analyze the three sequences given:\n\n(a) HEEHH\n- This sequence consists of 5 spins.\n\n(b) HEEEHH\n- This sequence consists of 6 spins.\n\n(c) HEHEHH\n- This sequence also consists of 5 spins.\n\nKey considerations:\n- Shorter sequences generally offer a higher probability of occurring within limited spins because they need fewer consecutive specific results and have more possible starting positions within the total number of spins.\n- Additionally, considering that there are five H segments and three E segments, sequences with a higher proportion of H\u2019s might intuitively seem more likely to occur because H\u2019s are more common. However, the exact probabilities also depend on the specific arrangement and the length.\n\nFor the given choices and number of spins (20 spins):\n- Sequences (a) HEEHH and (c) HEHEHH both have equal length (5 spins), offering potentially similar probabilities. However, the specific arrangement and segment commonality in the spinner might slightly influence their likelihoods.\n- Sequence (b) HEEEHH is the longest (6 spins), which slightly reduces its probability of occurring within the same number of spins compared to the shorter sequences.\n\nGiven these considerations and based on the length of the sequences alone, options (a) and (c) are generally more preferable than (b) due to their shorter length meaning more possible starts within 20 spins. Between (a) and (c), without further detailed probability analysis, they should have roughly similar chances based on sequence length, but option (a) has a slightly higher frequency of E's, which are less common and could slightly impact its likelihood.\n\nIn this manner, choosing between (a) HEEHH and (c) HEHEHH could depend on subtle preferences towards the arrangement. If we assume all else being equal or without additional computation details:\n- I would select **(a) HEEHH** as a reasonable choice owing to its more straightforward alternating pattern which might appear slightly simpler to occur within the dynamics of random spinning.

We can consider the number of times each sequence expects the spinner to land on Emerald, versus its total length.\n\nHere is the breakdown of each sequence:\n- Sequence (a) AEEEAEEA includes four E's in an 8-spin sequence.\n- Sequence (b) AAEEEAEA includes four E's in an 8-spin sequence.\n- Sequence (c) AEEEAEA includes four E's in a 7-spin sequence.\n\nConsidering that the length of Sequence (c) is shorter by one spin, and it still has only four E's like the others, it effectively has a slightly higher concentration of E's relative to its length compared to the other two. This could make its probability of occurring lower, given the lesser number of Amber faces in the sequence despite the higher likelihood of Amber outcomes.\n\nGiven that the length of the sequences in (a) and (b) are longer and share the same balance of A's and E's relative to the probabilities of each outcome, both (a) and (b) should technically have a similar likelihood. Since (c) is shortest with the same number of less probable outcomes (E), it should intuitively suggest a lower probability. But shorter sequences typically tend to be less complex and slightly more likely to occur merely due to having fewer events that need to align precisely. However, in this instance, the specific distribution and frequency of outcomes in (c) compared to the probability of getting an Emerald make it less likely to appear than either (a) or (b).\n\nComparing (a) and (b) where sequence composition and length are exact, the likelihood realistically does not vary substantially between these two since they have the same proportion of each face result over an equal span of spins.\n\nTherefore, selecting either (a) or (b) would statistically offer a marginally better chance over (c), given the heightened balance and length.
