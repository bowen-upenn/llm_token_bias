Thus:\n\nThe answer is (b) Some in GM knew for years there was a problem, but only started big recall this year because of pressure from regulatory agencies and public outrage.",

The designation of Al-Shabaab as a terrorist organization involves multiple factors including their overall activities, which encompass much more than just the enforcement of strict laws through violent tactics. While (b) provides a reason that aligns with their tactics, it simplifies and potentially limits the rationale behind their designation as a terrorist organization. The U.S. generally considers entities as terrorist organizations based on a wide range of activities, including but not limited to enforcement methods of strict laws. Thus, the more comprehensive and accurate choice is (a).",

It avoids the additional speculation about personal motives such as revenge, thus keeping the statement more focused and possibly less inflammatory.",

This statement does not specify the reason for the response, which could be either positive or negative.\n\nOption (b), however, adds a specific reason to the response from other restaurant owners, implying they are positive and impressed by the steps taken to combat the flu. This added detail makes the statement more specific and explanatory.\n\nFrom a logical perspective, option (b) is more consistent and likely in a business context where measures taken to ensure public safety, especially health-related, typically generate positive feedback if noted and appreciated by peers.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the more likely scenario would be:\n(b) Restaurant owner says there is \"a big response\" from other owners because they are impressed with the proactive steps taken to prevent the spread of flu.",
