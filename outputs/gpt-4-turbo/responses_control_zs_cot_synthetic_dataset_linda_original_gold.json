        "question": "Raj is a 28-year-old guy with a passion for computer science and mathematics. He graduated with a double major in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. Raj is known for his analytical mind, attention to detail, and love for problem-solving. In his free time, he enjoys coding personal projects, playing video games, and exploring different programming languages. Raj also has a strong interest in astronomy and often spends his evenings stargazing with his telescope. With his friendly and approachable demeanor, Raj is always willing to help his friends and classmates with challenging coding tasks.\n\nWhich is more probable?\n(a) Raj is a passenger vehicle driver.\n(b) Raj is a passenger vehicle driver and enjoys participating in hackathons and coding competitions.",

Option (b) involves a conjunction \u2014 being a passenger vehicle driver and enjoying participation in hackathons and coding competitions. According to the rules of probability, the probability of a conjunction is less than or equal to the probability of either single event alone.\n\nTherefore, the most probable option is:\n(a) Raj is a passenger vehicle driver.",

Therefore, the probability of just being a model maker and patternmaker is higher than that coupled with an additional specific activity.",

This is a fundamental rule in probability theory \u2014 the conjunction of two events cannot be more probable than either of the events individually.\n\nTherefore, based on probabilistic reasoning:\n**Option (a) Sam is a gambling dealer**, is statistically more probable than option (b), which combines being a gambling dealer with volunteering at an LGBTQ+ support center.",
