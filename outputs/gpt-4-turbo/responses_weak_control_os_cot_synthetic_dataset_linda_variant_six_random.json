The spinner will be spun 25 times and the sequence of emeralds (E) and lavenders (L) will be recorded. You are asked to select one sequence, from a set of three, and you will win $30 if the sequence you chose appears on successive spins of the spinner.Which sequence do you prefer to bet?\n(a) EELELL.\n(b) EEELEE.\n(c) EEELEL.",

This probability is influenced by the individual occurrences of E (Emerald) and L (Lavender) in each sequence, based on their distribution on the spinner.\n\nGiven:\n- Emerald (E): 5 out of 8 sectors\n- Lavender (L): 3 out of 8 sectors\n\nThe probability of each event (spinning E or L) can be calculated as:\n- P(E) = 5/8\n- P(L) = 3/8\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability of each sequence:\n\n(a) EELELL:\n   P(EELELL) = P(E) x P(E) x P(L) x P(E) x P(L) x P(L)\n             = (5/8) x (5/8) x (3/8) x (5/8) x (3/8) x (3/8)\n             = (5/8)^4 x (3/8)^2\n             = 625/4096 x 9/64\n             = 5625/262144\n\n(b) EEELEE:\n   P(EEELEE) = P(E) x P(E) x P(E) x P(L) x P(E) x P(E)\n             = (5/8) x (5/8) x (5/8) x (3/8) x (5/8) x (5/8)\n             = (5/8)^5 x (3/8)^1\n             = 3125/32768 x 3/8\n             = 9375/262144\n\n(c) EEELEL:\n   P(EEELEL) = P(E) x P(E) x P(E) x P(L) x P(E) x P(L)\n             = (5/8) x (5/8) x (5/8) x (3/8) x (5/8) x (3/8)\n             = (5/8)^4 x (3/8)^2\n             = 625/4096 x 9/64\n             = 5625/262144\n\nComparing the probabilities, sequence (b) EEELEE is more likely because it has fewer L's and more consecutive E's with a higher individual probability.
