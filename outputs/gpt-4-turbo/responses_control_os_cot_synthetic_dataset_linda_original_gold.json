        "question": "Raj is a 28-year-old guy with a passion for computer science and mathematics. He graduated with a double major in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. Raj is known for his analytical mind, attention to detail, and love for problem-solving. In his free time, he enjoys coding personal projects, playing video games, and exploring different programming languages. Raj also has a strong interest in astronomy and often spends his evenings stargazing with his telescope. With his friendly and approachable demeanor, Raj is always willing to help his friends and classmates with challenging coding tasks.\n\nWhich is more probable?\n(a) Raj is a passenger vehicle driver.\n(b) Raj is a passenger vehicle driver and enjoys participating in hackathons and coding competitions.",

        "init_model_answer": "Considering the probabilistic approach, we should select the scenario that represents a single event rather than a conjunction of events, even if the conjunction seems very fitting given the narrative presented. Therefore, the correct choice is:\n\n(a) Raj is a passenger vehicle driver.\n\nThis option is more probable statistically than the conjunction of him being both a passenger vehicle driver and enjoying participating in hackathons and coding competitions, as specified in option (b). The probability of a single event occurring is always greater than or equal to the probability of that event occurring in conjunction with another event.",

Therefore, the correct answer is:\n(a) Dwayne is a tile and stone setter.",

The additional condition in option (b) makes it a less probable scenario compared to option (a) when evaluated strictly by the rules of probability.",

According to the principles of probability, the likelihood of two events both occurring (in this case, being an explosives worker and actively participating in charity marathons) is always less than or equal to the probability of either event occurring on its own.

This is because the probability of a single event occurring (Sam being a gambling dealer) is statistically more likely than the probability of two specific conditions being met simultaneously (Sam being both a gambling dealer and volunteering at a local LGBTQ+ support center). Therefore, option (a) is more probable when applying basic principles of probability, despite how compatible option (b) might seem with Sam's personal interests.",
