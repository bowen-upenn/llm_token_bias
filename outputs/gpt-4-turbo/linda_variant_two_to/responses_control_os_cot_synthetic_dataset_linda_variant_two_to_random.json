Given the context (a school choir and their typical subject matter related to broader social or political concerns), it seems less probable that their advice in a song would be specifically about investing in cryptocurrency, particularly directed toward the president.\n\nThe principle here is to select the option that involves fewer, more general assumptions. Option (a) implies just the creation of a song with advice for the president, which is more general and believable given the group\u2019s known activities. Option (b) includes all elements of option (a) and adds a specific and less typical element (advice on cryptocurrency), which makes it less likely by the rules of probability (specifically, the conjunction fall up). \n\nHence, the more probable option is:\n(a) They have written another song, \"Dear Obama,\" which offers advice to the president.",
