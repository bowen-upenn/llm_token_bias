This option combines two events: paying the ticket and having dinner with friends as a conditional outcome.\n\nUsing probabilistic reasoning and understanding that the probability of a conjunction (two events happening together) is always less than or equal to the probability of either event occurring alone, we can deduce that option (a) is statistically more likely. The presence of an additional condition in option (b) makes it less probable than option (a) solely based on the increased specificity and requirements.\n\nTherefore, the most probable option is:\n(a) Tom would pay the ticket.",

The basic probability model states that the probability of a conjunction (two events occurring together) is never greater than the probability of either event occurring independently.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:  \n   Based on probabilistic thinking, it is statistically more likely that event A is true independently than event B, because B is a conjunction of event A and an additional specific condition.
