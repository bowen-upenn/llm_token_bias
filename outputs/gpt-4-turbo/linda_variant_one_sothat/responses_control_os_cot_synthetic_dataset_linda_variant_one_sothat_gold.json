Moreover, it includes the additional condition of decorating based on gender, which makes it a narrower and more specific situation.\n\n4. **Applying Probability Principles:**\n   - The probability of a single broader event (Event A) is always greater than or equal to the probability of a conjunction of that event with another specific condition (Event B).\n\nGiven these considerations, the answer to the question:\n\n(a) Kim would likely prepare for the arrival of her baby.\n(b) Kim would likely prepare for thearrival of her baby so that she could decorate the nursery based on the baby's gender.\n\nis  (a) Kim would likely prepare for the arrival of her baby.
