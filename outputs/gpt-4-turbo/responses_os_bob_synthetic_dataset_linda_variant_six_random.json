Consequently, the probability of landing on teal is higher than landing on green.\n\nTo maximize winning chances, you should pick the sequence that has more teal segments because they have a higher probability of occurrence. However, the sequences should also be considered for their arrangement and repetitive patterns, as these can influence their likelihood of appearing consecutively in real-world scenarios.\n\nSequence analysis:\n- (a) TGGTGTGTG contains a mix of T and G but has frequent switches between them.\n- (b) TGGTGGTTT features a longer string of teals at the end, which might slightly increase its frequency given the higher chance of landing on T.\n- (c) TGGTGGGTG has a mix of T and G with a higher occurrence of G together, making it slightly less likely to appear given green's lower probability of occurrence compared to teal.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the sequence with a larger section of consecutive T's and fewer switches overall could statistically appear more often given the probabilities of T and typical patterns of randomness.\n\nChoose:\n(b) TGGTGGTTT.",
