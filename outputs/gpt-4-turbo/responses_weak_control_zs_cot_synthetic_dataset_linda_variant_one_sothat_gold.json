Both options (a) and (b) involve the likelihood of Nathan launching the rocket again. The primary difference between the two is that option (b) adds a specific outcome: the rocket landing on the roof again.\n\n2. In general, the likelihood of a specific combination of two events (in this case, launching the rocket and it landing on the roof again) is less or equal to the likelihood of one of those events occurring by itself (launching the rocket again in this instance). This is based on basic probability principles, where the probability of a conjunction (A and B happening together) is never greater than the probability of either event alone.\n\n3. Scenario (b) is a more specific version of scenario (a). For option (b) to occur, not only does Nathan have to decide to launch the rocket again (which is already covered under option (a)), but this action must also result in the same specific outcome (landing on the roof). Whether or not the rocket lands on the roof again depends on variables like the angle of launch, wind conditions, and other factors that cannot be guaranteed.\n\n4. Therefore, option (a) \u201cNathan would likely launch the rocket again\u201d is more likely as it is less specific and more probable when not combined with the additional condition present in option (b).\n\nThis reasoning highlights the principle involved in avoiding the conjunction fallacy, which occurs when people mistakenly believe that specific conditions are more probable than a single general one.",
