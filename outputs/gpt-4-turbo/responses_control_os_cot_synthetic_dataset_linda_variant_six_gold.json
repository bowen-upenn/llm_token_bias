This involves considering the length of each sequence and the probability of hitting each color on each sector of the spinner.\n\nThe spinner has 8 sectors: 5 are blue (B), and 3 are emerald (E). The probability of the spinner landing on blue is 5/8, and on emerald is 3/8. Let's compute the probabilities of the three sequences:\n\n**Calculating probabilities:**\n\n1. For sequence (a) BBEBBE:\n   Probability = (5/8) * (5/8) * (3/8) * (5/8) * (5/8) * (3/8)\n   = (25/64) * (3/8) * (25/64) * (3/8)\n   = (75/512) * (75/512)\n   = 5625/262144\n\n2. For sequence (b) BEEBBE:\n   Probability = (5/8) * (3/8) * (3/8) * (5/8) * (5/8) * (3/8)\n   = (15/64) * (15/64) * (15/64)\n   = 3375/262144\n\n3. For sequence (c) BEBBE:\n   Probability = (5/8) * (3/8) * (5/8) * (5/8) * (3/8)\n   = (5/8) * (15/64) * (15/64)\n   = 1125/16384\n\n**Analyzing the sequences:**\n\nTo compare the probabilities:\n- The base probability of each \"B\" is 5/8 and each \"E\" is 3/8.\n- Shorter sequences inherently have a higher probability of occurrence, simply because there are fewer events that need to align. Hence, a shorter sequence within the 30 spins has a greater chance of appearing than a longer sequence.\n\nGiven the computations and considering the shorter length and respective probabilities of each sequence, the most probable sequence to occur during 30 spins because of its shorter length and corresponding probability calculation is:\n\n(c) BEBBE\n\nThus, the answer is (c) BEBBE, as it has a higher comparative probability of",
