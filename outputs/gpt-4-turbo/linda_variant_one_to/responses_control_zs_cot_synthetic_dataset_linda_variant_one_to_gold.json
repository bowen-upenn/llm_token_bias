        "init_model_answer": "Based on the principle of the conjunction fallacy, we know that the probability of a single event occurring is always higher than the conjunction of two events. In this scenario:\n\n- Option (a) suggests that Mark would continue training to increase his pull-up count beyond ten.\n- Option (b) suggests that Mark would continue training to increase his pull-up count beyond ten and also has a specific new goal of reaching twenty pull-ups.\n\nThe second option, while detailed and perhaps consistent with the narrative of goal-setting and progress, is a conjunction of two conditions (continuing training and setting a specific new goal of twenty pull-ups).\n\nTherefore, probabilistically speaking, the likelihood of just continuing training alone without specifying reaching exactly twenty pull-ups (option (a)) is higher than the likelihood of both continuing training and aiming for that specific number as a new target (option (b)).\n\nAnswer: (a) Mark would continue training to increase his pull-up count beyond ten.",
