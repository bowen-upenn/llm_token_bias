GERD usually symptoms include chest pain (due to heartburn), regurgitation, and sometimes stomach pain. The question involves evaluating the likelihood of experiencing these symptoms either individually or in combination.\n\nOption (a) suggests she experiences both chest pain and stomach pain, whereas option (b) proposes she only experiences chest pain.\n\nBased on probability calculation, the presence of an additional condition (in this case, stomach pain alongside chest pain) is typically less probable unless specified otherwise by specific medical information which is not provided here. Therefore, it's generally more likely that only the more common symptom of the condition (chest pain in the case of GERD) will be present.\n\nThus, the correct answer should be:\n(b) She experiences chest pain.",
