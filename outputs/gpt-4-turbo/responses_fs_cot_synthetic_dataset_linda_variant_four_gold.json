While it\u2019s more complex, it also is less probable merely based on randomness alone - both negative reviews of the movie need to happen along with positive reviews specifically for Jennifer Aniston, a subset of the first condition.\n\nGiven these points, the correct answer is (a) The movie receives bad reviews.
