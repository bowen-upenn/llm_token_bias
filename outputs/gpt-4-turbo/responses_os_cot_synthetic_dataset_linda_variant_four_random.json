Johnson fails in every primary contest but doesn't specify additional outcomes or situations related to his campaign. Losing every primary is a straightforward outcome that only relies on his popularity, campaign effectiveness, and competition, without any additional requirements.\n\n3. **Option (b) \"He loses every primary but gains significant media attention and influences policy discussions\"**: This option introduces more specific conditions \u2014 not only does he lose every primary, but he also achieves significant media attention and influences policy. This requires multiple layers of success (media impact and policy influence) despite electoral losses.\n\n4. **Step by Step Analysis**:\n    - **Primary Losses**: Assuming Ethan B. Johnson loses every primary (common to both options).\n    - **Secondary Outcomes (Option b)**: Achieving significant media attention and influencing policy discussions, even while losing, would require a strong message, public interest, and media appeal. These are additional hurdles beyond just participating in primaries.\n\nGiven that option (b) requires Ethan B. Johnson to not only lose all primaries but also manage to gain substantial additional achievements, it is by definition less probable because it adds more conditions needing fulfillment to the inherent probability in option (a).\n\nHence, option (a) \"He loses every primary\" is more likely as it's the simpler outcome and does not depend on additional factors for its realization.",
