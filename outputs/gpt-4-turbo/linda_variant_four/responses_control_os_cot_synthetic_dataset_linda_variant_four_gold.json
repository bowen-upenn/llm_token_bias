Option (b), although it might seem plausible given the context and content, includes a conjunction of two conditions: the book not only has to become a bestseller but also must be heavily criticized by Western scholars. According to the rules of probability, the likelihood of both events happening together (a conjunction) is always less than or equal to the probability of either event happening alone. Thus, option (a) is statistically more likely than option (b).",
