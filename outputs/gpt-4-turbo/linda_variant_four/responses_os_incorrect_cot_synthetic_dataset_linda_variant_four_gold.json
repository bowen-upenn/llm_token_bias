We want to compare the probability of A happening alone versus the probability of both A and B happening (A and then B).\n\n3. Looking at probability strictly: The probability of event A occurring does not depend on B since each fight's outcome is typically independent of others (assuming no lingering effects like injuries or changes in skill level). Hence, we can treat them as independent for this analysis.\n\n4. According to probability rules, the chance of two independent events both occurring (A and B together) is less than or equal to the chance of just one of those events occurring alone (just A). Mathematically, Pr(A and B) = Pr(A) * Pr(B), which will be less than or equal to Pr(A) if Pr(B) is less than 1.\n\nTherefore, it is more likely that:\n(a) Canelo loses his comeback fight alone,\nrather than\n(b) he loses his comeback fight but then wins his following three fights.\n\nBased on this simple probability analysis, without specific fight details or conditional impacts, we can confidently say that the probability of (a) is more likely than (b).",
