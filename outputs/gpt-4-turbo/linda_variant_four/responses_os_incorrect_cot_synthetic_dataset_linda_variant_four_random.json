This scenario implies that while the album is commercially successful enough to have a No. 1 single, it still does not receive Grammy nominations.

Generally, start-ups, particularly in competitive spaces like music streaming, face high failure rates due to various challenges such as market saturation, scalability, and financial issues. Thus, it's statistically more straightforward and likely to consider the scenario where the service might fail within the first year, as opposed to it failing and Michael also achieving notable success in a completely different yet related field like recording and releasing a chart-topping album.",

        "init_model_answer": "Given that the question involves a diplomatic event hosted by Fernando and Mme Isabella, it suggests a scenario involving international relations, which inherently attracts some level of international media attention. The nature of a diplomatic event typically includes discussions or engagements with foreign representatives, making it relevant to international audiences and media.\n\nOption (a) suggests that the diplomatic event receives no international media coverage, which is less likely due to the inherent international interest in diplomatic gatherings. \n\nOption (b) also assumes that the event receives no international media coverage, but adds that it significantly strengthens their domestic support. This outcome might be possible if the focus and content of the event are geared primarily towards domestic policy improvements or public relations successes that resonate more deeply with local constituencies than the international community. It can happen if the media strategy was intensely focused on domestic audiences to boost local support while not engaging or appearing relevant to international media.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n(b) The event receives no transitional media coverage but significantly strengthens their domestic support. This choice reflects a scenario where the international implications are minimal or unreported, yet the domestic impact is significant, aligning with the added detail given in option (b).",
