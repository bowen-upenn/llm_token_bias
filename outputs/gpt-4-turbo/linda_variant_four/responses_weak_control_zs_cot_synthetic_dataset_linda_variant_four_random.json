This is because the conjunction can only occur if both A and B occur, limiting its probability to scenarios where both are true.\n\n4. **Applying the Conjunction Rule:**\n   - Option (a) stands alone as the album receiving no nominations.\n   - Option (b), however, includes the same scenario as in option (a) (no Grammy nominations), plus an additional condition (having a Billboard No. 1 single).\n\n5. **Logical Conclusion:** Since option (b) requires two particular conditions to be met - not receiving a Grammy nomination and having a Billboard hit - it is by definition less likely or equally likely but never more likely than option (a), which requires only one specific condition (no Grammy nominations).\n\nHence, it is more probable that (a) will occur over (b) because adding more specific conditions (as in option (b)) does not increase the likelihood of an event, it restrictively filters it.",

        "init_model_answer": "The correct answer is:\n(a) His book will not make it to the bestseller list.\n\nThis is because option (b) includes two conditions: the book not making the bestseller list and being critically acclaimed. Since \"and\" statements (conjunctive events) combine the probability of separate events, the likelihood of both conditions being true simultaneously (as in option b) is generally less than or equal to the probability of just one of the conditions occurring (as in option a). Essentially, option (a) is logically more likely because it encompasses a broader range of outcomes (any situation in which the book doesn't make the bestseller list, regardless of critical acclaim).\n",

A basic principle of probability states that the probability of a conjunction (two events occurring together) cannot be higher than the probability of either of the events occurring alone. In this case, by adding conditions in option (b), the probability becomes more restrictive and thus lower than the probability of option (a) alone. Therefore, option (a) is more likely.",

        "use_multi_agents": false,
        "init_model_answer": "The correct choice is:\n(a) The event receives no international media coverage.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. **Understanding Options**: Option (a) suggests that the event does not capture the attention of international media. Option (b) also includes that the event receives no international media coverage, but adds another condition\u2014that it significantly strengthens domestic support.\n\n2. **Probability Consideration**: In general, the probability of two events both happening (a conjunction of events) is never greater than the probability of either event happening alone. This is a basic probability rule where P(A and B) \u2264 P(A) and P(A and B) \u2264 P(B).\n\n3. **Applying Probability to Options**: When comparing (a) and (b), (b) is a stricter condition because it requires two specific outcomes to be true: no international coverage and increased domestic support. Therefore, the probability of both these conditions being met together (option (b)) could not be higher than the probability of just one of those conditions being met (no international coverage in option (a)).\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Because the inclusion of an additional specific condition (strengthening domestic support) in option (b) makes it a subset of the broader condition in option (a), option (a) is more likely. The conjunction fallacy would be to think that adding more specific details makes an option more probable. It does not; it actually decreases the probability because more conditions need to be satisfied for the statement to be true.",

        "init_model_answer": "The correct answer is (a) The podcast receives mediocre reviews.\n\nHere's the step-by-step thought process:\n\n1. On assessing both options, the first option (a), that the podcast receives mediocre reviews, is a singular event that can happen independently.\n\n2. The second option (b), that the podcast receives mediocre reviews but gains millions of subscribers, includes everything in the first option and adds another specific event (gaining millions of subscribers).\n\n3. By the rules of probability, adding extra conditions to an event (as in option (b)) can make it less likely to happen, not more.\n\n4. Even if a podcast has mediocre reviews, gaining millions of subscribers (as mentioned in option (b)) could indeed occur but is statistically less likely than merely receiving mediocre reviews (since not all podcasts with mediocre reviews will achieve high subscriber counts).\n\n5. Therefore, the simpler and less specific event (option (a), the podcast receives mediocre reviews) is statistically more likely than the compound or specific event (option (b)). \n\nThis resolution hinges on understanding that a conjunction of two events (both receiving mediocre reviews and gaining millions of subscribers) cannot be more likely than one of the events occurring individually (just receiving mediocre reviews).",

Option (a), which only has one facet regarding the movie not winning awards, is broader and thus statistically more likely than option (b), which includes the additional specific condition of becoming a box-office hit on top of not winning any awards.

The addition of a second, specific condition (brokering a groundbreaking agreement) makes (b) inherently less likely than (a), which only requires that he struggle with contemporary geopolitics.

This indicates a partial shift toward free-market practices while retaining state control over certain crucial sectors.\n\nConsidering China's economic structure and political history, a radical transformation to a completely free-market system (as suggested in option (a)) is less plausible due to the ingrained role of the state in key economic sectors and the government's preference for maintaining control over strategic industries. On the other hand, option (b) appears more feasible as it proposes a partial adoption of free-market mechanisms while still preserving the state\u2019s influence in critical areas, aligning better with the incremental reforms and controlled liberalization patterns observed in China's economic policy approach.\n\nTherefore, the more likely option between the two presented is:\n(b) He implements a completely free-market system but maintains strong state control over key industries.",
