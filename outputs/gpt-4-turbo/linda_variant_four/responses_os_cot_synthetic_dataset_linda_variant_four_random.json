The addition of more conditions (selling out major venues, in conjunction with the album not charting) typically reduces the overall likelihood of the combined event occurring.\n\nHence, the more probable event between the two is:\n(a) The album won't chart in any country.",

Based on this hypothetical association, we might infer certain philosophical or ideological inclinations.\n\n2. **Understanding Each Option**:\n   - **Option (a)**: He speaks in favor of modern industrial policies.\n   - **Option (b)**: He speaks in favor of modern industrial policies but emphasizes traditional values and non-violent resistance.\n\n3. **Evaluation**:\n   - **Consistency with Name and Influences**: Given the influence suggested by \"Gandhi,\" it is likely that any stance on modern issues would also reflect a commitment to traditional values and the principle of non-violence if he adheres to philosophies similar to those of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi.\n   - **Likelihood of Integrating Beliefs in Speeches**: People often integrate their core beliefs and values in their public talks, especially on complex issues like industrial policies where ethical considerations can be paramount.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given the likely association with Gandhi\u2019s principles, it is more probable that if Aarav speaks on modern industrial policies, he would also emphasize traditional values and non-violent resistance, aligning with the overarching philosophical ethos commonly associated with the Gandhi name.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n(b) He speaks in favor of modern industrial policies but emphasizes traditional values and non-violent resistance.",
