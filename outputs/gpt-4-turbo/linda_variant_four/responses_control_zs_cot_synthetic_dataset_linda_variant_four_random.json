Apply the rule of probability:\n   - The probability of two events occurring together (the conjunction of events, P(A and B)) is always less than or equal to the probability of either event occurring alone (P(A) or P(B)).\n\nGiven this set-up, option (a) \"He speaks in favor of modern industrial policies\" is statistically more likely than the conjunction in option (b) \"He speaks in favor of modern industrial policies but emphasizes traditional values and non-violent resistance.\"\n\nCorrect answer:\n(a) He speaks in favor of modern industrial policies.",
