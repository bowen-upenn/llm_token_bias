This is because, based on the rules of probability, the likelihood of a single occurrence (the book becoming a bestseller) is always greater than the probability of that same occurrence in conjunction with another specific condition (the book being heavily criticized by Western scholars). Thus, (a) is more probable than (b).",

The likelihood of David implementing a completely free-market system alone (a single event) will always be greater or at least equal to the likelihood of him implementing a completely free-market system while simultaneously maintaining strong state control over key industries (a compound event).\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n(a) He implements a completely free-market system.",
