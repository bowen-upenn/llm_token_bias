The probability of rolling pink (P) is 5/8, and cyan (C) is 3/8.\n\nNow, we calculate the probability of each sequence:\n\n1. For sequence (a) PPPPCCC:\n   - The probability is (P)(P)(P)(P)(C)(C)(C) = (5/8)^4 * (3/8)^3\n\n2. For sequence (b) PPPCCC:\n   - The probability is (P)(P)(P)(C)(C)(C) = (5/8)^3 * (3/8)^3\n\n3. For sequence (c) CPPPCCC:\n   - The probability is (C)(P)(P)(P)(C)(C)(C) = (3/8) * (5/8)^3 * (3/8)^3\n\nTo compare these probabilities, note that (5/8)^3 * (3/8)^3 is common to all three sequences. The differentiating factor is the fourth face rolled in each sequence:\n- Sequence (a) has an extra (5/8) for pink.\n- Sequence (b) has shorter sequence making it slightly more likely in a random sequence due to fewer rolls required.\n- Sequence (c) starts with cyan, which is less likely (3/8).\n\nThe simplest sequence among these that has a higher likelihood of occurring given fewer rolls and uses the most probable individual outcomes (P) before getting three (C) is sequence (b) PPPCCC. This sequence requires fewer specific outcomes in a row, thus holding a slightly higher chance of occurring within 25 rolls.\n\nSo the answer is:\n(b) PPPCCC.",

Here, there is 1 Blue face and 5 Indigo faces on the die. Therefore, the probability \\( P(I) = \\frac{5}{6} \\) and \\( P(B) = \\frac{1}{6} \\).\n\nFirst, we should calculate the probability of each sequence occurring:\n\n**Sequence (a) - IIBIBBII:**\n- Probability = \\( \\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^5 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^3 = \\frac{3125}{279936} = \\frac{3125}{279936} \\)\n\n**Sequence (b) - IIBIBBI:**\n- Probability = \\( \\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^5 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^2 = \\frac{15625}{279936} \\)\n\n**Sequence (c) - IIBBIBBI:**\n- Probability = \\( \\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^4 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^4 = \\frac{625}{279936} \\)\n\nThe next consideration is the length of each sequence:\n- Sequence (a) has 8 characters.\n- Sequence (b) has 7 characters.\n- Sequence (c) has 8 characters.\n\nSince the fewer number of characters in a sequence should statistically allow it more chances to occur (fewer particular rolls need to match), and sequence (b) not only has fewer characters than the others but a higher probability calculation due to fewer occurrences of the less likely Blue face, sequence (b) gives you the best chance of winning the bet.\n\nAnswer: **(b) IIBIBBI** is the more favorable sequence to bet on.",
