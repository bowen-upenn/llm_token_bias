This is a single event.\n\nOption (b) combines the same event of international hotel brands and developers flocking to RAK with a specific reason - because the local cuisine is delicious and the weather is pleasant. This is a conjunction of two events: the influx of developers and the appeal of local cuisine and weather as linked reasons for this influx.\n\nSince option (b) adds additional stipulations that narrow the conditions, it becomes less likely purely from a probabilistic standpoint than option (a), which does not have these additional qualifications.\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is:\n(a) International hotel-related brands and developers are flocking to RAK to build new facilities and residences.",
