Since you are prompted to choose between \"(a) 5% certain\" they are alive or \"(b) 5% certain\" they are alive because they were not in the targeted location during the airstrikes, we need to determine which is more likely based on typical language usage by officials in such reports.\n\nTypically, officials report high percentages when they are nearly certain of the outcome. Therefore, if an official says it's \"99,\" this would logically suggest a 99% certainty of some specific outcome, likely opposing the 5% certainty options given. \n\nGiven this understanding:\n(b) 5% certain\" they are alive because (b) they were not in the labeled target location during the airstrikes.\nThis statement is elaborated on with a cause (\u201cbecause they were not in the targeted location\u201d), providing additional reasoning why there would be a 5% certainty of their being alive. This makes it a slightly more reasonable statement under the assumptions here, as it includes context that would explain the low certainty despite official reports of strikes.\n\nSo, the answer would be:\n(b) 5% certain\" they are alive because (b) they were not in the targeted location during the airstrikes.",

Obama frequently addressed significant national issues while in office. We can deduce this because typical presidential dealings involve widespread concerns such as the economy and national security, alongside specific incidents. Hence, option (a) is more likely as it doesn't prescribe a specific reason (like public interest in b) for discussing these topics but states that they could naturally be part of the discussion.\n\nCorrect Answer: (a) Obama also discusses declining economy and fight against terrorist groups",
