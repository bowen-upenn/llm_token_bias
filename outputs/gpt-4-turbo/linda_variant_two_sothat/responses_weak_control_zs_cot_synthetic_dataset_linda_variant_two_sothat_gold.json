The likelihood of a general statement (as in option a) being true is usually higher than the likelihood of a more specific one (as in option b), because adding more details (as in option b) could introduce elements that may not be true, thus reducing the overall likelihood.\n\nConsidering the information given:\n- The statement about HealthCare.gov experiencing technical issues implies that the federal site might have had performance problems. However, it doesn\u2019t offer any specific comparison with state sites directly, only allowing for speculation.\n- Both statements (a and b) say that state sites did better than the federal site, but (b) adds that \"fewer people reported issues while enrolling through them than through HealthCare.gov.\"\n\nSince option (b) includes all elements of option (a) plus an additional detail, it is inherently less likely by the principle of the conjunction fallacy \u2013 adding more specific conditions reduces the likelihood of the full condition being true.\n\nTherefore, considering the principle of likelihood and simplicity:\nThe correct answer is \n**(a) State sites' success varied but seemingly did better than the federal site.**",
