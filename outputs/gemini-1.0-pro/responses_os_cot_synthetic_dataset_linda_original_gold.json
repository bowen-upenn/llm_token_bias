        "question": "Raj is a 28-year-old guy with a passion for computer science and mathematics. He graduated with a double major in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. Raj is known for his analytical mind, attention to detail, and love for problem-solving. In his free time, he enjoys coding personal projects, playing video games, and exploring different programming languages. Raj also has a strong interest in astronomy and often spends his evenings stargazing with his telescope. With his friendly and approachable demeanor, Raj is always willing to help his friends and classmates with challenging coding tasks.\n\nWhich is more probable?\n(a) Raj is a passenger vehicle driver.\n(b) Raj is a passenger vehicle driver and enjoys participating in hackathons and coding competitions.",
        "target_answer": "(a) Raj is a passenger vehicle driver",
        "retry": false,
        "use_multi_agents": false,
        "init_model_answer": "## Determining the more probable option\n\nHere's an analysis to determine the more probable option between (a) and (b):\n\n**Raj as a Passenger Vehicle Driver:**\n\n* This option focuses solely on his profession as a driver.\n* The information provided doesn't offer strong evidence for or against this option.\n\n**Raj as a Passenger Vehicle Driver and Participating in Hackathons:**\n\n* This option combines his profession with his passion for coding and problem-solving.\n* Participating in hackathons directly aligns with his expertise in computer science, mathematics, and coding.\n* His analytical mind and love for problem-solving further strengthen this connection.\n* His free time activities involve coding personal projects and exploring programming languages, indicating a strong commitment to his field.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the provided information, **option (b) is more probable**. Raj's background, interests, and skills point towards him being a driver who also actively participates in hackathons and coding competitions. While the information doesn't explicitly state this, his demonstrably strong interest and skills in computer science make it the more likely option compared to simply being a driver without any connection to his other passions. \n\nTherefore, **(b) Raj is a passenger vehicle driver and enjoys participating in hackathons and coding competitions** is the more probable option.",
