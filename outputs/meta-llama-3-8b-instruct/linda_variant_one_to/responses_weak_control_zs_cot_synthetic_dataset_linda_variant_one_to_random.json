This suggests that his strengths lie in visual-spatial skills rather than other areas.\n\nGiven this information, I think the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Striker would likely draw more maps or explore more advanced cartography.\n\nThis option is more likely because it is a natural extension of Striker's existing talent and interest in maps. It's a way for him to build upon his strengths and develop his skills further.\n\nOption (b) is less likely because it's unclear how drawing maps would help Striker play basketball better.
