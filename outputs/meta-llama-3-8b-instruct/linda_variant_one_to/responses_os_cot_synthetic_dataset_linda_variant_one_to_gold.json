However, he quit the job because he didn't enjoy the stress. This suggests that Ray's primary motivation was to earn money for the computer, not to find a job that he enjoys.\n\nAfter quitting the job, Ray still thinks about getting a new computer. This implies that Ray's desire for a new computer hasn't changed, and he's still looking for a way to get one.\n\nGiven this information, the more likely scenario is:\n\n(a) Ray might start looking for a less stressful job or explore alternative ways to earn or save money for the computer.\n\nThis option is more probable because Ray's primary goal is to get a new computer, and he's willing to explore different options to achieve this goal. The addition of a powerful gaming setup in option (b) is not necessarily relevant to Ray's original goal and motivation.",

On the first day of school, Adam walks in with a haircut.\n3. Everyone is shocked.\n\nNow, let's consider the options:\n\n(a) Adam would likely enjoy the attention and reactions from his peers.\n\nThis option focuses on Adam's general personality and tendency to enjoy attention. Since Adam is known for having long hair, it's possible that he enjoys being the center of attention. However, we don't have any evidence to suggest that he specifically enjoys reactions to his new haircut.\n\n(b) Adam would likely enjoy the attention and reactions from his peers to his new haircut.\n\nThis option focuses on the specific situation - Adam's new haircut. Given that everyone is shocked, it's likely that Adam will receive a lot of attention and reactions from his peers. Since Adam is known for having long hair, the new haircut is a significant change, and people will likely notice and comment on it. This option is more likely because it's specific to the situation and takes into account the context.\n\nSo, I'd select option (b) as the more likely scenario.",
