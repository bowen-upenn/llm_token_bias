In this case, helping the bird and helping the bird to recover are two distinct events.\n\nSince the protagonist has already cleaned the windows, the likelihood of her helping the bird is independent of helping the bird recover from hitting the window. In fact, the probability of the protagonist helping the bird to recover is likely higher than just helping the bird, as the latter is a more general action.\n\nTherefore, I select option (a) as the more likely choice, as it is a single event with a higher likelihood than the conjunction of helping the bird and helping the bird recover.",
