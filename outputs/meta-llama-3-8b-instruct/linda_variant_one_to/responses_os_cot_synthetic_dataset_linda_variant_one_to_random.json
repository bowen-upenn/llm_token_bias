The new pants fit him perfectly, which means they are comfortable for him.\n3. Jordan was happy that his pants were no longer too tight.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(a) Jordan would continue wearing the new pair of pants.\n\nThis is a very likely scenario, as the pants fit him well and he was happy with the fit. He would likely continue wearing them for daily activities, such as going to work, running errands, or just lounging around.\n\n(b) Jordan would continue wearing the new pair of pants to a musical concert.\n\nThis scenario is less likely. While Jordan is happy with his new pants, there is no inherent reason why he would specifically wear them to a musical concert. He might wear them to other events or activities, but there's no guarantee he would choose them for a concert.\n\nTherefore, I would choose option (a) as the more likely scenario.",

This suggests that Adam's haircut is not just a minor adjustment but a major transformation.\n\nGiven this, option (a) is more likely because Adam's peers are reacting to the significant change in his appearance, which is the haircut. It's probable that Adam would enjoy the attention and reactions from his peers due to the unexpected change.\n\nOption (b) is less likely because the new cafeteria menu is not directly related to Adam's haircut or his appearance. It's unlikely that the reactions from his peers would be about the cafeteria menu.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Adam would likely enjoy the attention and reactions from his peers.",

This is a strong indication that he would take action to protect them.\n\nThe second option, celebrating a local festival, is not mentioned anywhere in the scenario. There is no context or information provided about a festival, and it's not a relevant or logical reason for Joe to protect his sheep.\n\nTherefore, the more likely answer is:\n\n(a) Joe would protect his sheep from the wolves.",

This is a normal and expected behavior for someone who has gone to the trouble of setting up a garden.\n\nOn the other hand, the second option is highly unlikely. There is no connection between tending to a garden and improving skills at playing the violin. It's not a logical or expected behavior, and it's not something that would naturally follow from setting up a garden.\n\nTherefore, I would select:\n\n(a) Kendall would regularly water and tend to her garden.",

The candidate is likely to continue with the speech while acknowledging the bird's presence, rather than trying to incorporate the bird into a discussion about policy changes.

People often share stories about significant events that have happened to them, especially if it's a notable or unusual experience like getting hit by shrapnel.\n\nHowever, it's highly unlikely that Tom would tell the story of how he got his scar to check if anyone needs help with their computer.

While it's possible that Jodie might consider the cleaners for a future cleaning job while planning a vacation, it's not a natural or direct consequence of her experience with them.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (a) Jodie might recommend the cleaners to others or rehire them in the future.",
