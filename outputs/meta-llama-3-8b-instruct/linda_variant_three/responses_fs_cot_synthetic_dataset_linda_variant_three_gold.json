Many people with varicose veins experience these symptoms due to the reduced blood flow and increased pressure in the veins.\n\n(b) He experiences cramps.\n\nCramps are a symptom of varicose veins, but fatigue is not necessarily a direct symptom of the condition. While some people with varicose veins may experience fatigue, it's not a universal symptom.\n\nBased on the information provided, I would select:\n\n(a) He experiences cramps and fatigue.\n\nThis option is more likely because cramps and fatigue are common symptoms of varicose veins, and the man is 63 years old, which increases the likelihood of experiencing these symptoms.",
