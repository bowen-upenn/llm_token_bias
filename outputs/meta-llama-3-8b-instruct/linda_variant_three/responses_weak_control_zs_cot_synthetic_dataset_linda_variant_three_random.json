The question states that Taylor has been diagnosed with Hepatitis B, which is a viral infection that can cause a range of symptoms, including loss of appetite and frequent headaches.\n2. Since Taylor has been diagnosed with Hepatitis B, it's reasonable to assume that they may experience some symptoms related to the infection.\n3. Option (b) states that Taylor experiences loss of appetite. This is a possible symptom of Hepatitis B, so it's not an unlikely scenario.\n4. Option (a) states that Taylor experiences loss of appetite and frequent headaches. This is also a possible scenario, as both loss of appetite and frequent headaches are symptoms of Hepatitis B.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: Which one is more likely?\n\nGiven the information provided, both options (a) and (b) are plausible, but they're not mutually exclusive. It's possible that Taylor experiences both loss of appetite and frequent headaches, or maybe they experience only one of these symptoms.\n\nIn this case, I would select option (b) as the more likely scenario.
