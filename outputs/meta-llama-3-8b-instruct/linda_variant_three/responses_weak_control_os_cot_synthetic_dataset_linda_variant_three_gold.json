Impetigo is a skin condition that can cause various symptoms, not just limited to a red sore around the nose and a blister.\n\n(b) He has a red sore around his nose.\n\nThis option is more general and covers a wider range of possibilities. A red sore around the nose is a common symptom of Impetigo, and it's more likely to occur than the specific combination mentioned in option (a).\n\nTherefore, I select:\n\n(b) He has a red sore around his nose.\n\nThis answer is more probable because it's a more general and common symptom of Impetigo, whereas option (a) is a specific and less likely combination of symptoms.",

This means she has a pre-existing condition.\n2. Both options (a) and (b) describe symptoms that can be related to Hypertension. However, (a) specifies additional symptoms (headache and lack of concentration) that may or may not be present.\n3. Given that she has Hypertension, it's more likely that she will experience some symptoms related to the condition. In this case, the correct answer is:\n\n(b) She experiences a headache.\n\nThe reasoning is that a headache is a common symptom of Hypertension, whereas lack of concentration is not necessarily a direct symptom. Therefore, it's more probable that she experiences a headache, which is a symptom of Hypertension.",
