Dengue fever often presents with symptoms such as red spots over the body and chills. However, having red spots over the body and chills is not unique to Dengue and can be symptoms of other diseases as well.\n\nConsidering the options:\n\n(a) She also has red spots over her body and chills.\n\n(b) She also has red spots over her body.\n\nOption (a) is a conjunction of two events: having red spots over the body and having chills. Option (b) is a single event: having red spots over the body.\n\nSince the probability of a single event occurring is always higher than the probability of it occurring in conjunction with another specific event, I will choose:\n\n(b) She also has red spots over her body.\n\nThis option is statistically more probable than option (a).",

I'll assume that the events are independent and that the probabilities are based on general knowledge.\n\nOption (a) states that Judy experiences swelling of the stomach and abdominal pain. This is a conjunction of two events: swelling of the stomach and abdominal pain.\n\nOption (b) states that Judy experiences swelling of the stomach. This is a single event.\n\nSince the probability of a conjunction is always less than or equal to the probabilities of its constituents, I'll choose the option involving a single event as it statistically holds a higher likelihood. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(b) She experiences swelling of the stomach.\n\nThis is because the probability of Judy experiencing swelling of the stomach is higher than the probability of her experiencing both swelling of the stomach and abdominal pain.",

Similarly, I'll consider the probability of having brittle nails as a symptom of hypothyroidism.\n\nSince hypothyroidism is a condition that affects various symptoms, it's likely that Rohit experiences cold hands and feet as a symptom. The probability of this event is higher than the probability of experiencing both cold hands and feet and brittle nails.\n\nTherefore, I'll choose the option:\n\n(a) He experiences cold hands and feet.\n\nThis option is more likely because the probability of a single event (experiencing cold hands and feet) is higher than the probability of it occurring in conjunction with another specific event (having brittle nails).",
