According to the Migraine Research Foundation, approximately 18% of women and 6% of men experience Migraine.\n\nGiven that Morgan has Migraine, it's more likely that they also experience other common symptoms of Migraine, such as excessive hunger. Hunger is a common symptom of Migraine, often referred to as \"migraine hunger\" or \"migraine hunger pangs.\" It's estimated that around 30-50% of people with Migraine experience excessive hunger as a symptom.\n\nOn the other hand, knee pain is not a typical symptom of Migraine. While some people with Migraine may experience joint pain or stiffness, knee pain is not a common symptom of the condition.\n\nTherefore, based on the base rate of Migraine and the additional symptoms, I select:\n\n(b) They also experience excessive hunger.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to clarify anything!",
