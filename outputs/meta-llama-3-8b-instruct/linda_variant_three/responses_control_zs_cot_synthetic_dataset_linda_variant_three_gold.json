Since Sunita has Hyperthyroidism, which is a condition that can cause various symptoms, we can assume that the probability of her experiencing abnormal menstruation and muscle weakness is not independent.\n\nHowever, we can still analyze the options independently. Abnormal menstruation and muscle weakness are two separate symptoms that can occur in people with Hyperthyroidism. Let's assume that the probability of Sunita experiencing abnormal menstruation is P(A), and the probability of her experiencing muscle weakness is P(B).\n\nSince Sunita has Hyperthyroidism, the probability of her experiencing abnormal menstruation is higher than the general population. Let's say P(A) is around 0.6 (60%).\n\nSimilarly, the probability of her experiencing muscle weakness is also higher due to Hyperthyroidism. Let's say P(B) is around 0.4 (40%).\n\nNow, let's analyze the conjunction of the two events: abnormal menstruation and muscle weakness. The probability of this conjunction is P(A and B), which is the product of the probabilities of the individual events:\n\nP(A and B) = P(A) \u00d7 P(B) = 0.6 \u00d7 0.4 = 0.24\n\nSince Sunita has Hyperthyroidism, the probability of her experiencing abnormal menstruation alone is still higher than the probability of the conjunction:\n\nP(A) = 0.6 > P(A and B) = 0.24\n\nSimilarly, the probability of her experiencing muscle weakness alone is higher than the probability of the conjunction:\n\nP(B) = 0.4 > P(A and B) = 0.24\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that:\n\n(b) She also experiences abnormal menstruation\n\nis more likely than:\n\n(a) She also experiences abnormal menstruation and muscle weakness.\n\nThis solution ignores the narrative context and focuses solely on the probabilistic models, which is the correct approach to avoid the conjunction fallacy.",

However, the question is asking about the likelihood of two specific symptoms: altered sensorium and headache.\n\nLet's consider the probability of each option:\n\n(a) They also experience altered sensorium and headache.\n\nThis option is a conjunction of two events: altered sensorium and headache. Since both events are related to the same underlying cause (brain hemorrhage), we can assume that they are not independent. However, we still need to consider the probability of each event occurring.\n\nThe probability of altered sensorium given brain hemorrhage is likely to be high (let's say 0.8). The probability of headache given brain hemorrhage is also high (let's say 0.7). However, the probability of both events occurring together is the product of their individual probabilities: 0.8 \u00d7 0.7 = 0.56.\n\n(b) They also experience altered sensorium.\n\nThis option is a single event, which is the likelihood of altered sensorium occurring given the presence of brain hemorrhage.
