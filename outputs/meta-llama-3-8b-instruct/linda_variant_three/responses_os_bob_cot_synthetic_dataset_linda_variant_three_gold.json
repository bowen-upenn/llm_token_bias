The rash is usually a result of the immune system's response to the virus, and it can manifest as red spots or patches on the skin.\n\nConsidering this information, I would say that:\n\n(b) She also has red spots over her body.\n\nis more likely.\n\nThe presence of red spots is a common symptom of Dengue, and it's often mentioned alongside other symptoms like fever and headache. The presence of chills, on the other hand, is not a specific symptom of Dengue, and it could be a symptom of many other illnesses as well.\n\nTherefore, option (b) is more likely.",
