        "init_model_answer": "I'd be happy to help!\n\nSince the man is diagnosed with Paralysis due to a brain hemorrhage, it's likely that the brain hemorrhage is causing damage to the brain tissue. This type of damage can cause a range of symptoms, including weakness or paralysis of one side of the body.\n\nGiven this information, option (a) \"He also experiences weakness of one body side\" is more likely. This is because weakness or paralysis of one side of the body is a common symptom of a brain hemorrhage, and it's a more specific and direct consequence of the condition.\n\nOption (b) \"He also experiences weakness of one body side and headache\" is less likely because it adds an additional symptom (headache) that may or may not be present in this case. While headaches are a common symptom of a brain hemorrhage, it's not as directly related to the paralysis as the weakness of one body side.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (a) He also experiences weakness of one body side.",

Alcoholic hepatitis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the liver due to excessive alcohol consumption.\n\nGiven this, it's more likely that Judy experiences:\n\n(a) She experiences swelling of the stomach and abdominal pain.\n\nThis is because Alcoholic hepatitis often causes symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and swelling of the stomach and abdomen due to fluid accumulation.",

        "init_model_answer": "I'd be happy to help!\n\nSince Rohit has hypothyroidism, which is a condition characterized by an underactive thyroid gland, it's more likely that he experiences symptoms related to the slowing down of his metabolism.\n\nOption (a) \"He experiences cold hands and feet\" is a common symptom of hypothyroidism, as the thyroid hormone helps regulate body temperature. Many people with hypothyroidism report feeling cold, especially in their hands and feet.\n\nOption (b) \"He experiences cold hands and feet and has brittle nails\" is a more specific and less common combination of symptoms. While some people with hypothyroidism may experience brittle nails, it's not a universal symptom of the condition. Therefore, option (a) is more likely to be true.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (a) He experiences cold hands and feet.",
