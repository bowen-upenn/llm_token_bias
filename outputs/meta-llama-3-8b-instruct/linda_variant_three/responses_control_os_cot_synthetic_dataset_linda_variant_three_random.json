We're asked to compare the probability of two events: (a) Casey experiences malaise and toe numbness, and (b) Casey experiences malaise.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the probabilities of each event separately. Since we don't have any additional information about Casey's symptoms, we can assume that malaise and toe numbness are independent events.\n\nThe probability of Casey experiencing malaise is likely to be relatively high, given that Dengue is a disease that can cause a range of symptoms, including malaise. Let's assume the probability of malaise is around 0.8 (80%).\n\nThe probability of Casey experiencing toe numbness is likely to be relatively low, as toe numbness is a specific symptom that may not be directly related to Dengue. Let's assume the probability of toe numbness is around 0.1 (10%).\n\nNow, let's consider the conjunction of the two events: Casey experiences malaise and toe numbness. The probability of this conjunction is the product of the probabilities of each event:\n\nP(Casey experiences malaise and toe numbness) = P(malaise) \u00d7 P(toe numbness) = 0.8 \u00d7 0.1 = 0.08 (8%)\n\nIn contrast, the probability of Casey experiencing malaise alone is simply the probability of malaise:\n\nP(Casey experiences malaise) = 0.8 (80%)\n\nSince 0.8 (80%) is greater than 0.08 (8%), the correct answer is:\n\n(b) Casey experiences malaise.\n\nThe probability of a single event occurring (malaise) is higher than the probability of it occurring in conjunction with another specific event (malaise and toe numbness).",

We know that chest pain is a common symptom of a heart attack, and blurred vision is also a possible symptom. However, we don't have any information that suggests the probability of blurred vision is higher than the probability of chest pain.\n\nIn fact, chest pain is a much more common symptom of a heart attack than blurred vision. Therefore, the probability of a person experiencing chest pain is higher than the probability of a person experiencing both chest pain and blurred vision.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n(b) She experiences chest pain.\n\nThis is because the probability of a single event occurring (chest pain) is always higher than the probability of it occurring in conjunction with another specific event (blurred vision).",

The probability of Samantha experiencing swelling of the stomach is not given, but it is likely to be a relatively common symptom of alcoholic hepatitis.\n\nThe probability of Samantha experiencing difficulty speaking is also not given, but it is also likely to be a relatively common symptom of alcoholic hepatitis.\n\nSince both symptoms are likely to occur independently, the probability of Samantha experiencing both swelling of the stomach and difficulty speaking (a) is likely to be lower than the probability of her experiencing swelling of the stomach alone (b).\n\nTherefore, I will choose option (b) She also experiences swelling of the stomach as the more likely event.",

We're asked to compare the probability of two events:\n\n(a) He experiences cold hands and feet.\n(b) He experiences cold hands and feet and acute sensitivity to noise.\n\nTo answer this question, we need to consider the probabilities of these events in isolation.\n\nCold hands and feet are a common symptom of Hypothyroidism, which is a condition affecting thyroid hormone production. It's likely that Ricardo experiences cold hands and feet due to his medical condition. Let's assume the probability of this event is around 70-80%.\n\nAcute sensitivity to noise is a separate symptom that may or may not be related to Hypothyroidism. Let's assume the probability of this event is around 20-30%.\n\nNow, we need to combine these probabilities to determine the likelihood of the conjunction event:\n\n(b) He experiences cold hands and feet and acute sensitivity to noise.\n\nThe probability of the conjunction is the product of the individual probabilities:\n\nP(cold hands and feet and acute sensitivity to noise) = P(cold hands and feet) \u00d7 P(acute sensitivity to noise)\n= 0.7 \u00d7 0.2\n= 0.14\n\nIn this case, the probability of the conjunction is approximately 14%.\n\nIn comparison, the probability of the single event (a) He experiences cold hands and feet is around 70-80%.\n\nBased on these probabilities, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) He experiences cold hands and feet.\n\nThis is because the probability of a single event occurring is always higher than the probability of it occurring in conjunction with another specific event.",
