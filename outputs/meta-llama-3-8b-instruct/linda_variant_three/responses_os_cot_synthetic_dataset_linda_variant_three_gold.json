Now, we need to consider the other options.\n\n(a) They are also experiencing shivering and chills: This option is more likely because shivering and chills are common symptoms of an allergic reaction. Many people experience these symptoms when they have an allergic reaction, so it's reasonable to assume that Alex would also experience shivering and chills given that they have an allergy.\n\n(b) They are also experiencing shivering: This option is less likely because it's not specific enough. Just because Alex has an allergy doesn't necessarily mean they will experience shivering. They could experience other symptoms like hives, itching, or difficulty breathing, but not necessarily shivering.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (a) They are also experiencing shivering and chills.",
