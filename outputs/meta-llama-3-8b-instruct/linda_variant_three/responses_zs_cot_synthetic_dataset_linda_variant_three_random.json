Alcoholic hepatitis is a condition that affects the liver, and it can cause a range of symptoms.\n\nOption (a) states that Samantha also experiences swelling of the stomach and difficulty speaking. Difficulty speaking is not a typical symptom of alcoholic hepatitis. However, swelling of the stomach (also known as ascites) is a common symptom of liver disease, including alcoholic hepatitis.\n\nOption (b) states that Samantha also experiences swelling of the stomach. This is more likely to be the correct answer because ascites is a common symptom of liver disease, and it is more specific to the liver than difficulty speaking.\n\nTherefore, I would select option (b) as the more likely answer.",
