The event we're interested in is John experiencing a urinary tract infection.\n2. Burning micturition and sudden headaches are common symptoms of a urinary tract infection.\n3. Option (a) states that John also experiences burning micturition and sudden headaches.\n4. Option (b) states that John also experiences burning micturition, but doesn't specify about the headaches.\n\nFrom a probabilistic perspective, the event \"John has a urinary tract infection\" is the base event. The probability of this event is high, let's say 80%.\n\nThe event \"John experiences burning micturition\" is a common symptom of a urinary tract infection, so the probability of this event given the base event is high, let's say 70%.\n\nNow, let's consider the conjunction event \"John experiences burning micturition and sudden headaches\". This event is a combination of two symptoms. The probability of this event given the base event is the product of the probabilities of each symptom:\n\nP(John experiences burning micturition and sudden headaches | John has a urinary tract infection) = P(John experiences burning micturition | John has a urinary tract infection) \u00d7 P(John experiences sudden headaches | John has a urinary tract infection)\n= 0.7 \u00d7 P(John experiences sudden headaches | John has a urinary tract infection)\n\nSince the probability of sudden headaches given a urinary tract infection is unknown, let's assume it's moderate, around 0.5.

Similarly, the probability of him experiencing left arm numbness is also independent of the probability of him having Hypertension.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n(a) He also experiences a headache and left arm numbness.\n\nThis option is a conjunction of two independent events (headache and left arm numbness). The probability of this conjunction is the product of the probabilities of the individual events.

In other words, the presence of cilantro dislike does not provide any additional information about the likelihood of frequent headaches.\n\nGiven that Taylor is a 64-year-old individual who has suffered a brain hemorrhage, it is more likely that Taylor experiences frequent headaches due to the brain damage. This event (a) is a direct consequence of Taylor's medical condition.\n\nOn the other hand, the conjunction event (b) combines two unrelated events: frequent headaches and a strong dislike for cilantro.

The probability of this conjunction is the product of the probabilities of the individual events: P(depression and tinnitus) = P(depression) \u00d7 P(tinnitus).\n\nOption (b) is a single event: depression. Since we're looking for the more likely option, we should choose the one with a higher probability.\n\nSince the probability of the conjunction is the product of the individual probabilities, we can write:\n\nP(depression and tinnitus) = P(depression) \u00d7 P(tinnitus) \u2264 P(depression)\n\nThis inequality follows from the fact that the probability of a conjunction is always less than or equal to the probability of its constituents.\n\nTherefore, option (b) \"He also experiences depression\" is more likely than option (a) \"He also experiences depression and tinnitus\".\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n(b) He also experiences depression.",

Swelling of the stomach is a common symptom of liver disease, and difficulty speaking is not a typical symptom.\n\nGiven this information, the correct answer is:\n\n(b) She also experiences swelling of the stomach.\n\nThis is because swelling of the stomach is a more likely symptom for someone with alcoholic hepatitis, and the addition of difficulty speaking does not increase the probability of this event.
