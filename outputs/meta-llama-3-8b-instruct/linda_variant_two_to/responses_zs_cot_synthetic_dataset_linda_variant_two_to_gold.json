This means they used the data from Kepler to make an estimate or prediction about the number of planets in the Milky Way.\n\nThe second sentence says that 22% of sun-like stars have possibly habitable planets, which means that out of 100 sun-like stars, 22 of them might have planets that can support life.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n(a) Kepler has found 3,538 planet candidates to date\n\nThis option is simply stating the number of planet candidates found by Kepler, but it doesn't specifically mention anything about habitable planets.\n\n(b) Kepler has found 3,538 planet candidates to date to have at least one potentially habitable planet.\n\nThis option is saying that among the 3,538 planet candidates found by Kepler, at least one of them is potentially habitable.\n\nSince the research shows that 22% of sun-like stars have possibly habitable planets, it's more likely that option (b) is correct.",
