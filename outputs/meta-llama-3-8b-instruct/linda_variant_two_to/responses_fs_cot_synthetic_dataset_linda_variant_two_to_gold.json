Let's break down the question step by step.\n\nThe question states that \"They see Elizabeth Warren, not President Barack Obama, as their leader.\" This implies that Elizabeth Warren is the leader that the progressives in Congress are looking up to.\n\nGiven this information, which of the two options is more likely?\n\n(a) They're expecting significant battles with Republicans to defend their priorities\n(b) They're expecting significant battles with Republicans to defend their priorities to maintain federal funding for social programs.\n\nI would choose option (a) as the more likely scenario. The phrase \"defend their priorities\" is quite general and could refer to any aspect of their policy agenda. It's more likely that the progressives in Congress are expecting battles with Republicans to defend their overall policy priorities, rather than specifically to maintain federal funding for social programs.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (a).",

The fact that he died in a public place, such as a train track, suggests a sudden and impulsive act, rather than a premeditated attempt to escape consequences.\n\nSo, the more likely answer is:\n\n(a) Her son, Derek Ward, 35, later died in an apparent suicide, stepping in front of a train",

She is known for being an environmental advocate and works for a non-profit organization dedicated to wildlife conservation. Emily is passionate about preventing climate change and has been arrested several times during peaceful protests. She often writes articles and appears on panels discussing the importance of preserving natural habitats. In her free time, Emily enjoys hiking and bird watching. Which one is more likely?\n\n(a) Emily volunteers for a new environmental campaign.\n(b) Emily volunteers for a new environmental campaign that focuses on saving endangered species in the Amazon rainforest.\n\nThe correct answer is (a) Emily volunteers for a new environmental campaign.\n\nMy reasoning is that Emily is already an environmental advocate and works for a non-profit organization dedicated to wildlife conservation. It's more likely that she would volunteer for a new environmental campaign that aligns with her existing interests and work.\n\nFor the second question:\n\nAgra is home to the famed Taj Mahal, India's most popular tourist spot\nWhich is more likely?\n\n(a) \nNo motive has been determined yet \n(b) \nNo motive has been determined yet because the suspect's car was found parked illegally.\n\nThe correct answer is (a) No motive has been determined yet\n\nMy reasoning is that the police are still investigating the incident, and there is no mention of the suspect's car being parked illegally. The motive for the crime is still unknown, so it's more likely that no motive has been determined yet.\n\nFor the third question:\n\nObama orders review of surveillance programs after disclosures of allies snooping on allies. \nU.

The recession is likely a contributing factor, as it has led to increased economic uncertainty and reduced opportunities for young people. This is a plausible explanation for the decline.\n\nHowever, the introduction of MTV's \"16 and Pregnant\" and comprehensive sex education in schools might also play a role in the decline. The show raises awareness about the challenges of teenage pregnancy and promotes responsible sexual behavior. Comprehensive sex education in schools can also provide teenagers with accurate information and skills to make informed decisions about their sexual health.\n\nGiven the evidence, it's difficult to say which factor is more likely to be the primary cause of the decline. The recession might be a more immediate and direct cause, but the show and sex education might be indirect but still significant contributors.\n\nHowever, if I had to choose one option, I would select:\n\n(b) Part of the decline can be attributed to the recession, expert says to MTV's \"16 and Pregnant\" and comprehensive sex education in schools.\n\nThis option acknowledges the potential impact of the recession, while also recognizing the possible role of the show and sex education in promoting responsible behavior.",
