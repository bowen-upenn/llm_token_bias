Additionally, it is mentioned that Forest Lawn Memorial Park employees won't say whether Jackson's body is there, which suggests that the location of his grave is not publicly disclosed. Given these circumstances, it is more likely that the funeral company has stringent security patrols to keep fans from visiting Michael Jackson's specific grave site, rather than just having general security patrols.",
