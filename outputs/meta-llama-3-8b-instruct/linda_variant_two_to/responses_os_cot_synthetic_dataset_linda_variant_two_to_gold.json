This implies that the orientation being referred to is sexual orientation.\n\nThe year 1975 is mentioned, which is when homosexuality was de-listed as a mental disorder. This suggests that the context is about the shift in the medical community's view of homosexuality.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(a) Homosexuality de-listed as mental disorder in '75, but some programs still treat it.\n\nThis option seems to be a straightforward statement of fact. It's possible that some programs still treat homosexuality as a mental disorder, despite it being de-listed in 1975.\n\n(b) Homosexuality de-listed as mental disorder in '75, but some programs still treat it to correct heterosexual behavior.\n\nThis option seems to be implying that the programs that still treat homosexuality as a mental disorder are doing so in order to \"correct\" someone's sexual orientation to be heterosexual. This goes against the statement from the American Psychological Association, which urges against trying to change someone's sexual orientation.\n\nGiven the context and the information provided, I think option (a) is more likely. The American Psychological Association's statement suggests that the focus is on not trying to change someone's sexual orientation, rather than trying to change it to be heterosexual.",

The funeral company, Forest Lawn Memorial Park, is not saying whether Michael Jackson's body is actually at the burial site.

Grave hunters are trying to visit Michael Jackson's burial site, which implies that there might be a high demand to visit his grave.\n3. In light of these points, it's likely that the funeral company would take measures to secure the area and prevent fans from visiting the specific grave site.\n\nBased on this analysis, I would choose option (b) as the more likely scenario:\n\n(b) Funeral company has stringent security patrols to keep fans from visiting Michael Jackson's specific grave site.\n\nThis option is more probable because it takes into account the uncertainty surrounding Michael Jackson's burial location and the high demand to visit his grave, which would likely prompt the funeral company to take measures to secure the area.",
