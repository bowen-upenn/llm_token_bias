This means that it's more likely that some passengers and crew members would not survive the crash.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n(a) All 155 passengers and crew members on board survived the landing\n\nThis option is extremely unlikely, given the base rate of survival in a plane crash. It's possible that some passengers and crew members might have survived the initial crash, but it's highly unlikely that all 155 would have survived without any injuries or fatalities.\n\n(b) All 155 passengers and crew members on board survived the landing to celebrate a miraculous escape together later that evening\n\nThis option is also unlikely, but it's more plausible than option (a).
