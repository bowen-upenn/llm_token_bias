The organizer mentions that some traditionally Democratic Jews are hesitant to support Obama.\n\nThe given information states that Florida has 650,000 Jews, many of whom are Democrats. This implies that there is a significant Jewish population in Florida with a Democratic lean.\n\nGiven this context, it's more likely that the traditionally Democratic Jews are hesitant to support Obama due to his policies, rather than simply being hesitant to support him. After all, the Schlep is an initiative to persuade them to support Obama, implying that they need convincing.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n(b) Florida has 650,000 Jews, many of them Democrats to be hesitant in supporting Obama due to his policies.",
