Both options (a) and (b) are related to the same event (all passengers and crew members surviving the landing).\n2. Since both options are describing the same event, we can ignore the extraneous information about celebrating a miraculous escape together later that evening.\n3. We need to focus on the probability of the event itself: all 155 passengers and crew members on board surviving the landing.\n4. This event is a single, independent occurrence. There's no additional information that would make one option more likely than the other.\n5. In probabilistic thinking, the probability of a single event is often represented by a probability of 1 (certainty) or a probability less than 1 (uncertainty).\n\nIn this case, the probability of all 155 passengers and crew members on board surviving the landing is either 1 (certainty) or less than 1 (uncertainty). However, there's no additional information that would make one option more likely than the other.\n\nTherefore, I would select:\n\n(a) All 155 passengers and crew members on board survived the landing\n\nThis option is more likely because it's a single event, and there's no additional information that would make one option more likely than the other.",

This event is a straightforward demographic fact, and we can assume it's a high-probability event.\n\nNow, let's consider the conjunction: Florida has 650,000 Jews, many of them Democrats to be hesitant in supporting Obama due to his policies. This event is a combination of two conditions: having 650,000 Jews, many of them Democrats, and being hesitant in supporting Obama due to his policies.\n\nThe key is to recognize that the conjunction is a subset of the single event. In other words, all the Jews who are hesitant in supporting Obama due to his policies are already included in the larger group of Jews who are Democrats.\n\nGiven this, the correct answer is (a) Florida has 650,000 Jews, many of them Democrats. This event is more likely because it's a single, high-probability event, whereas the conjunction is a subset of this event and is therefore less likely.\n\nSo, I explicitly select option (a) as the more likely outcome.",
