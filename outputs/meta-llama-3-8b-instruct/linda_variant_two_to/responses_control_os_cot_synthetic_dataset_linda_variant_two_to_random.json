This is a conjunction of two events: the vessel is trying to disrupt the whaling ships, and they're doing it to increase media coverage. The second event (increasing media coverage) is not necessarily related to the first event (disrupting whaling ships), so the probability of the conjunction is lower than the probability of the single event.\n\nTherefore, I'm going to choose option (a) as the more likely scenario.",

We can abstract the problem from its narrative context and focus solely on the probabilistic models. Ignore all extraneous background information.\n3. The key insight is that the probability of a single event occurring is always higher than the probability of it occurring in conjunction with another specific event.\n\nIn this case, the event is \"lines forming early for Lumpia Shack's Philippines-inspired food\". This event can occur independently of the presence or absence of street performers practicing their routines.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Lines form early for Lumpia Shack's Philippines-inspired food\n\nThis option is statistically more probable than option (b) because the probability of the single event occurring is higher than the probability of it occurring in conjunction with another specific event.",

We're asked to compare the likelihood of two events:\n(a) All 155 passengers and crew members on board survived the landing.\n(b) All 155 passengers and crew members on board survived the landing to order pizza for dinner.\n\n2.

Since the event described in option (b) is a subset of the event described in option (a), we can conclude that option (a) is more likely. This is because the probability of a single event occurring (survival of all 155 passengers and crew members) is always higher than the probability of it occurring in conjunction with another specific event (ordering pizza for dinner).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) All 155 passengers and crew members on board survived the landing.",
