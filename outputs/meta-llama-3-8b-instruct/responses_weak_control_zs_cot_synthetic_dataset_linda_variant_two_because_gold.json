The sentence simply states that Israel fears any aid would bolster Hamas, without providing additional context or justification.\n\nOption (b) is less likely because it adds an additional justification for Israel's fears, which is not necessary to convey the idea.\n\nSo, option (a) is more likely.",

It does not introduce any biases or assumptions.\n\nOption (b) is a more complex statement that introduces the concept of biases and assumptions. It suggests that people often jump to conclusions based on limited information and biases towards specific narratives.\n\nBased on this analysis, I would argue that Option (b) is more likely to be the case. The statement introduces the concept of biases and assumptions, which is a common phenomenon in human decision-making.",
