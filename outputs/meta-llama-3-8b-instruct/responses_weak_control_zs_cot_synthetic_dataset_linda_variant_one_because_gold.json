This is a neutral statement that simply states that Cora would follow the doctor's instructions.\n\nOption (b) states that Cora would take her antibiotics as prescribed because she wanted to avoid getting sick again. This statement adds an additional motivation for Cora to take her antibiotics as prescribed.\n\nBased on the analysis, it seems that option (a) is more likely to be true. This is because option (a) simply states that Cora would take her antibiotics as prescribed, without adding any additional motivations or assumptions.\n\nIn contrast, option (b) adds an additional motivation for Cora to take her antibiotics as prescribed, which makes the statement less likely to be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis, option (a) is more likely to be true than option (b).",
