After experiencing embarrassment and discomfort due to his torn jeans, Ken might indeed decide to make some changes to his wardrobe or diet.\n\nNow, let's consider option (b). This option suggests that Ken might start a diet or buy new clothes that fit better because he felt embarrassed when his jeans tore in public.\n\nThis option is also plausible. The feeling of embarrassment and shame can indeed motivate people to make changes to avoid similar situations in the future.\n\nSo, which option is more likely? In my opinion, both options are plausible, and it's difficult to say which one is more likely.\n\nHowever, if I had to make an educated guess, I would say that option (a) is slightly more likely. This is because the feeling of embarrassment and shame is a powerful motivator, and it's likely that Ken would be motivated to make changes to avoid similar situations in the future.\n\nOf course, this is just my opinion, and there's no way to know for sure which option is more likely.",
