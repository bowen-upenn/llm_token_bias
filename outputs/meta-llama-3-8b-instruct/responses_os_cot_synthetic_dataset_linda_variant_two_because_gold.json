I think I've found the answer!\n\nThe more likely option is (b) Israel fears any aid would bolster Hamas, officials say because it would violate existing sanctions against the terrorist organization.\n\nWhy do I think this? Well, it's because the first part of the option (Israel fears any aid would bolster Hamas, officials say) is a general statement that could apply to any aid to Gaza. However, the second part of the option (because it would violate existing sanctions against the terrorist organization) adds a specific and concrete reason why Israel would fear the aid.",
