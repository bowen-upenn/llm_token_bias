Similarly, let's assume that the probability of the movie failing at the box office is 0.6 (or 60%). Finally, let's assume that the probability of Ethan winning an award for his performance is 0.2 (or 20%).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the probability of each event occurring**\nNow that we have the probability of each event, we can calculate the probability of each event occurring.\n\nFor event (a), the probability of the movie receiving critical backlash and failing at the box office is:\n\n0.8 (probability of critical backlash) x 0.6 (probability of box office failure) = 0.48\n\nFor event (b), the probability of the movie receiving critical backlash, failing at the box office, and Ethan winning an award for his performance is:\n\n0.8 (probability of critical backlash) x 0.6 (probability of box office failure) x 0.2 (probability of Ethan winning an award) = 0.096\n\n**Step 4: Determine which event is more likely**\nNow that we have calculated the probability of each event, we can compare the probabilities and determine which event is more likely.\n\nIn this case, the probability of event (a) is 0.48, while the probability of event (b) is 0.096.

The question asks which of the two options is more likely:\n\n(a) James wins a Grand Slam on his return\n(b) James wins a Grand Slam on his return but retires immediately after the tournament\n\nLet's think about this question. The key to solving this question is to understand the concept of conditional probability.\n\nConditional probability is a probability that is conditional on some other event or set of events. In other words, conditional probability is the probability of an event occurring given that some other event or set of events has occurred.\n\nIn this question, we are asked to compare the probabilities of two different events. The first event is James winning a Grand Slam on his return. The second event is James winning a Grand Slam on his return but retiring immediately after the tournament.\n\nTo compare the probabilities of these two events, we need to consider the probability of each event occurring given that the other event has occurred.\n\nIn this case, the probability of James winning a Grand Slam on his return but retiring immediately after the tournament is equal to the probability of James winning a Grand Slam on his return, because the two events are mutually exclusive. In other words, if James wins a Grand Slam on his return, he cannot also retire immediately after the tournament. Therefore, the probability of James winning a Grand Slam on his return but retiring immediately after the tournament is equal to the probability of James winning a Grand Slam on his return, because the two events are mutually exclusive.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) James wins a Grand Slam on his return.",

We need to determine which option is more likely:\n\n(a) His book will not make it to the bestseller list.\n(b) His book will not make it to the bestseller list but will be critically acclaimed.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the probability of each option occurring.\n\nOption (a) states that the book will not make it to the bestseller list. This option is more likely to occur, as there are many factors that can affect a book's success, such as marketing, reviews, and competition.\n\nOption (b) states that the book will not make it to the bestseller list but will be critically acclaimed. This option is less likely to occur, as critical acclaim is not a guarantee of success, and many books that receive critical acclaim do not necessarily become bestsellers.\n\nIn conclusion, option (a) is more likely to occur, as there are many factors that can affect a book's success, and critical acclaim is not a guarantee of success.",

Option (a) states that the event receives no international media coverage. Option (b) states that the event receives no international media coverage but significantly strengthens their domestic support.\n\nBased on the information provided, it seems that option (b) is more likely.
