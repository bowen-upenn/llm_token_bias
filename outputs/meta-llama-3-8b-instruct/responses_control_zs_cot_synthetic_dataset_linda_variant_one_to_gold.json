The question states that Jordan noticed his pants were too tight, he gained weight, and he bought a new pair of bigger pants. This provides a narrative context.\n2. The question then asks which is more likely: (a) Jordan would continue wearing the new pair of pants or (b) Jordan would continue wearing the new pair of pants to work.\n3. To answer this question, we need to abstract the problem from its narrative context and focus solely on the probabilistic models.\n\nIn this case, the probabilistic model is that Jordan will continue wearing the new pair of pants. This is a single event, and the probability of this event occurring is 1 (or 100%).\n\nThe event \"Jordan will continue wearing the new pair of pants to work\" is a conjunction of two events: (1) Jordan will continue wearing the new pair of pants and (2) Jordan will go to work.\n\nThe probability of this conjunction is less than or equal to the probabilities of its constituents. In this case, the probability of Jordan going to work is 1 (or 100%), but the probability of Jordan continuing to wear the new pair of pants is still 1 (or 100%), so the probability of the conjunction is 1 (or 100%).\n\nTherefore, the more likely event is (a) Jordan would continue wearing the new pair of pants.",
