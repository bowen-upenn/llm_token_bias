In fact, it's quite possible that many albums may not chart at all in their first week.\n\nOption (b) states that the album does not chart on its first week but eventually goes platinum.

It's challenging to win a Grand Slam, even for professional tennis players, and James's lack of recent experience makes it even more unlikely.\n\n(b) James wins a Grand Slam on his return but retires immediately after the tournament: This is slightly more plausible. If James does win a Grand Slam, he might decide to retire immediately, as he's already achieved his goal and doesn't feel the need to continue playing.

However, there are many other talented players in the league, and winning MVP is a very competitive achievement.\n\n(b) He wins the MVP of the season but his team doesn't make the playoffs: This option seems less likely because, typically, teams that have players who win MVP awards are strong contenders for the playoffs.

It's unlikely that her podcast would receive both mediocre reviews and gain millions of subscribers simultaneously.\n\nGiven that podcast reviews are often subjective and depend on various factors, it's more likely that Sarah's podcast would receive a mix of positive and negative reviews, with some people enjoying it and others not being as fond of it.\n\nHowever, gaining millions of subscribers is a significant achievement that requires a combination of factors, including quality content, effective marketing, and a bit of luck. While it's not impossible, it's less likely than receiving a more moderate response.\n\nTherefore, I would select:\n\n(a) The podcast receives mediocre reviews.\n\nThis option is more plausible and aligns with the typical outcomes for a new podcast.",
