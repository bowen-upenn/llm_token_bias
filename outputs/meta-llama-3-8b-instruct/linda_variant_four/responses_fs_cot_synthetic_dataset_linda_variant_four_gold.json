They have been active in the music industry for many years and have a strong reputation.\n\nConsidering this, I would select option (a) The album won't chart in any country.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\nWhile it's possible that the album might not chart in every country, it's highly unlikely that it wouldn't chart at all. The Rolling Stones have a dedicated fan base and are known for their iconic music, which would likely attract some attention and sales in various countries.\n\nOn the other hand, option (b) The album won't chart in any country but their world tour sells out all the major venues is more plausible. The Rolling Stones have a strong touring history, and their live performances are often highly anticipated and well-attended. It's possible that the album might not chart in every country, but their fans would still show up to see them perform live.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, I think option (a) The album won't chart in any country is more likely.",

It's not impossible for a movie to not win any awards, especially if the awards season is highly competitive.\n2. The movie becoming a box office hit is also a possible scenario. Movies can be successful and make a lot of money without winning any awards.\n\nNow, let's think about the relationship between these two scenarios. It's more likely that a movie that becomes a box office hit would also win some awards, not necessarily all of them, but some. This is because awards can be a major factor in boosting a movie's popularity and attracting more viewers.\n\nTherefore, I would select option:\n\n(a) The movie wins no awards.\n\nThis is because it's more likely for a movie to not win any awards than for it to become a box office hit without winning any awards.",

However, the world has changed significantly since his era, with new technologies, global powers, and complex issues emerging. It is more likely that he would struggle to understand the contemporary geopolitics, given the vast differences between the past and present.\n\nOption (b) suggests that Marshall would eventually be able to grasp the complexities of modern geopolitics and broker a groundbreaking international agreement, which may be less likely considering the significant changes that have occurred since his time.\n\nSo, my answer is (a) He struggles to understand contemporary geopolitics.",
