The probability of the album receiving no music awards is higher than the probability of it receiving no music awards and reaching top 10 on the Billboard 200 chart. This is because there are many reasons why an album might not receive music awards, such as the competition being very strong that year or the awards not being a good fit for the album's genre.\n\nOn the other hand, the probability of an album reaching top 10 on the Billboard 200 chart is relatively low, especially considering the number of albums released each year.
