This suggests that the album might not be a commercial success in terms of chart performance, but it has a strong fan base and is successful in terms of live performances.\n\nConsidering this, I would select option (b) as more likely:\n\n(b) The album won't chart in any country but their world tour sells out all the major venues.\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!",
