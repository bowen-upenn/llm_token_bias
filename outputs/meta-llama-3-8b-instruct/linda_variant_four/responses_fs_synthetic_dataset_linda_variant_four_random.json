        "init_model_answer": "I'd be happy to help!\n\nI select option (a) The company fails within the first year.\n\nReasoning: Starting a new company is inherently risky, and the failure rate for startups is relatively high. While Ethan D. Young may have a good plan and reputation, there are many factors that can contribute to a company's failure, such as market demand, competition, and execution. Therefore, it's more likely that the company fails within the first year than it is to secure significant investment and pivot successfully.",
