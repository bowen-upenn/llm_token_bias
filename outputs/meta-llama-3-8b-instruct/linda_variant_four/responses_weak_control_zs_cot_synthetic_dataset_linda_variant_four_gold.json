As Elizabeth II is a monarch and a symbol of the British monarchy, it's more plausible that her memoir would focus on her experiences, reign, and historical context rather than controversial political opinions. Her memoir is unlikely to delve into political controversies, as her role is to maintain the dignity and neutrality of the monarchy.\n\n(b) The book reveals controversial political opinions but becomes a bestseller due to her historical significance and the rarity of a monarch publishing such material.\n\nThis option is less likely. While it's possible that Elizabeth II's memoir could include some surprising or contrarian views, it's a stretch to assume that she would publish a memoir with controversial political opinions. Additionally, the fact that she's a monarch and a symbol of the British monarchy would likely mean that her opinions would be closely scrutinized and potentially controversial.",

The event \"The album receives poor reviews\" is independent of the event \"One single becomes a top hit on the charts\".\n2. The probability of the album receiving poor reviews is unknown, but we can assume it's less than 0.5 (since it's unlikely that all albums receive poor reviews).\n3. The probability of one single becoming a top hit on the charts is also unknown, but it's likely to be less than 0.5 (since it's not guaranteed that any single will become a top hit).\n4. The event \"The album receives poor reviews and low sales\" is a subset of the event \"The album receives poor reviews\". This means that the probability of poor reviews and low sales is lower than the probability of poor reviews alone.\n5. The event \"The album receives poor reviews but one single becomes a top hit on the charts\" is a subset of the event \"The album receives poor reviews\". This means that the probability of poor reviews and one single becoming a top hit is lower than the probability of poor reviews alone.\n\nGiven these points, I'd argue that:\n\n(a) The album receives poor reviews and low sales is more likely.\n\nThis is because poor reviews and low sales are more strongly related than poor reviews and a top hit single. The probability of poor reviews is higher than the probability of a top hit single, and the probability of low sales is higher when the album receives poor reviews.\n\nIn contrast, option (b) assumes that a top hit single is more likely to occur when the album receives poor reviews, which is not necessarily true. A top hit single can occur regardless of the album's overall quality, and the two events are independent.\n\nSo, I'd choose option (a) as the more likely scenario.",

This is because the album's initial poor performance (not charting on its first week) increases the difficulty of it eventually going platinum.\n\nSo, based on statistical reasoning, I'll choose option (a) The album does not chart on its first week.",

Therefore, (b) is a subset of (a). In other words, if the event receives no international media coverage, it's also true that the event receives no international media coverage but significantly strengthens their domestic support.\n\nAccording to the principle of total probability, the probability of a subset (in this case, (b)) cannot be greater than the probability of the containing set (in this case, (a)). Therefore, I select:\n\n(a) The event receives no international media coverage.\n\nThis option is more likely to occur than (b) because (b) requires an additional condition (significantly strengthening domestic support) on top of receiving no international media coverage.",

The second option (b) is a conjunction of two events: losing in the primary elections and being chosen as the vice-presidential candidate again. The probability of both events occurring together is lower than the probability of just one event occurring (losing in the primary elections).
