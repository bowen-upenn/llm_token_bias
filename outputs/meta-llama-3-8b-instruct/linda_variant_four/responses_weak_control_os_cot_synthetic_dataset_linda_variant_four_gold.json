The album does not chart on its first week.\n\nNow, I'll consider the options:\n\n(a) The album does not chart on its first week.\n\nThis statement is a simple probability statement. Since the album is releasing next year, it's likely that it will chart on its first week (many albums do). However, it's also possible that it might not chart on its first week (depending on various factors like competition, marketing, and audience reception). So, I'll say that:\n\n(a) The album does not chart on its first week is somewhat probable, but not extremely unlikely.\n\nNow, let's consider the other option:\n\n(b) The album does not chart on its first week but eventually goes platinum.\n\nThis statement combines two conditions: the album doesn't chart on its first week and it eventually goes platinum. Here's the crucial part: the second condition (going platinum) implies that the album is successful, which is unlikely if it didn't chart on its first week.\n\nGiven the initial assumption that the album doesn't chart on its first week, it's more likely that it won't be successful (i.e., not go platinum) than that it will be successful despite not charting initially. Therefore, I conclude that:\n\n(b) The album does not chart on its first week but eventually goes platinum is less probable than (a) The album does not chart on its first week.\n\nSo, I select:\n\n(a) The album does not chart on its first week.\n\nAm I correct?",

Therefore, it is more likely that Gandhi would speak in favor of modern industrial policies, without emphasizing traditional values and non-violent resistance, as this would be a more straightforward and practical approach.",
