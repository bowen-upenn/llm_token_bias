The complexity of modern international relations, the rise of new global powers, and the evolution of international institutions would likely pose challenges for him.\n\nHowever, it's also important to consider that Marshall was a skilled diplomat and strategist who was able to navigate complex international situations in his time. His ability to adapt and learn would likely serve him well in understanding contemporary geopolitics.\n\nGiven these factors, I think the most likely scenario is:\n\n(a) He struggles to understand contemporary geopolitics.\n\nBut, I would like to add that it's not impossible for him to eventually understand and even excel in contemporary geopolitics, especially with the help of modern resources and mentors. Therefore, option (b) is not entirely implausible, but I believe option (a) is more likely.",

If Jessica Harris loses in the primary elections, it means she did not win the nomination, which makes it impossible for her to be chosen as the vice-presidential candidate again.",

Considering the two options, I think the probability of receiving a standing ovation from all present is relatively high, as it's a common way to show appreciation in a formal setting like the United Nations.\n\nNow, let's think about the second option. If Alexei Krushchev were to receive a standing ovation from all present, it's unlikely that he would then dramatically remove his shoe and bang it on the table, as this behavior would be unconventional and potentially disrupt the formal atmosphere.\n\nGiven these thoughts, I'll select the option that seems less likely:\n\n(b) He will receive a standing ovation from all present but then dramatically remove his shoe and bang it on the table.\n\nDid I make the correct choice?",
