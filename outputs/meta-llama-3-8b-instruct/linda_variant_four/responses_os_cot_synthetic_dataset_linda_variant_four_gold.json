So, this is a relatively high-probability event.\n* Jennifer Aniston receives praise for her performance: Jennifer Aniston is a well-established and highly acclaimed actress, known for her performances in TV shows and movies.

Therefore, the probability of Jennifer Aniston receiving praise for her performance is relatively high.\n\nGiven that the movie receiving bad reviews is a common occurrence, and Jennifer Aniston receiving praise for her performance is also a likely event, the probability of both events occurring together is higher than the probability of just one of these events occurring.\n\nTherefore, I would select:\n\n(b) The movie receives bad reviews but Jennifer Aniston receives praise for her performance.",

As the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy would likely have meetings with U.S. Congress members as part of the state visit. It's a standard protocol for visiting heads of state to meet with Congressional leaders to discuss bilateral relations, global issues, and other matters of mutual interest.\n2. A televised address to the nation is also a common occurrence during state visits, as it allows the visiting leader to address the American people directly and share their message or vision.\n3. However, it's less likely that Volodymyr Zelenskyy would not have any meetings with U.S. Congress members, as it's a key part of the state visit. It's possible that he might not have as many meetings as he would like, but it's unlikely that he wouldn't have any at all.\n4. On the other hand, it's more plausible that he might have a televised address to the nation without having meetings with U.S. Congress members, as both events are separate and can be scheduled independently.\n\nBased on these considerations, I would choose:\n\n(a) He will not have any meetings with U.S. Congress members.\n\nBut before you accept my answer, let me ask: Am I correct?",
