Implementing a completely free-market system would require a significant overhaul of China's economic system.\n\nOption (b) He implements a completely free-market system but maintains strong state control over key industries.\n\nThis option is more plausible because it would allow China to maintain a degree of state control over key industries, while also allowing for some degree of free-market competition.\n\nOverall, while both options are unlikely, option (b) is more plausible because it would allow China to maintain a degree of state control over key industries, while also allowing for some degree of free-market competition.",
