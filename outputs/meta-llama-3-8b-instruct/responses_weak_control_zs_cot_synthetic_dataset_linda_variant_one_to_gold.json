The passage tells us that Jodie's baby had an accident and that Jodie called around for cleaners. She finally found one that did a really good job.\n\nNow, let's consider the two options:\n\n(a) Jodie might recommend the cleaners to others or rehire them in the future.\n\n(b) Jodie might recommend the cleaners to others or rehire them in the future to remove a grape juice stain.\n\nNow, let's think step by step.",

However, there is no direct mention of how their goal of designing programs will help them earn a significant income.\n\nTherefore, option (a) is more likely, as it is more directly related to the protagonist's goal of designing programs that help people.",

Now, the question is, what is more likely to happen next?\n\nOption (a) suggests that Mark would continue training to increase his pull-up count beyond 10. This is a reasonable assumption, as Mark has already achieved his initial goal and may continue to push himself to new heights.\n\nOption (b) suggests that Mark would continue training to increase his pull-up count beyond 10 to achieve a new goal of 20 pull-ups. This is less likely, as Mark has already achieved his initial goal and may not have a clear motivation to push himself to a new goal.\n\nTherefore, I would say that option (a) is more likely to happen next.",
