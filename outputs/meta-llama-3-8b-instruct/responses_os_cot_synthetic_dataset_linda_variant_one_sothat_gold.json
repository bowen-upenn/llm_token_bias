The family is on a trip to Moab, Utah, and they are excited to see the beautiful landscape. They hike a lot and end the trip by camping near one of the Arches. It's unlikely that they would take photographs of the landscapes and Arches just to share them on social media.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the situation, I think option (a) is more likely. The family is on a trip to Moab, Utah, and they are excited to see the beautiful landscape. They hike a lot and end the trip by camping near one of the Arches. It's likely that they would take photographs of the landscapes and Arches to capture the beauty of the trip.",
