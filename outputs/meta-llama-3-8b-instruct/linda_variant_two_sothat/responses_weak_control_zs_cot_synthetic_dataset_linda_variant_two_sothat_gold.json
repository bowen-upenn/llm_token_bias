I'll analyze the situation:\n\nThe Pentagon reported that a Chinese fighter jet was aggressive in an encounter with a P-8 Navy patrol plane in the South China Sea. The Chinese jet made several \"dangerous\" passes and came within 20 feet of the P-8.\n\nThe two options provide different reasons for the White House's response. Option (a) simply states that the White House said the incident was a provocation and raised objection with Beijing. Option (b) adds an additional detail, stating that the White House raised objection with Beijing so that the U.S. could emphasize its commitment to maintaining freedom of navigation in the region.\n\nConsidering the situation, I believe that option (a) is more likely. The White House's response is likely to be a straightforward condemnation of the Chinese fighter jet's aggressive behavior, without any additional motivation or reason.\n\nTherefore, I select option (a) as the more likely scenario.",
