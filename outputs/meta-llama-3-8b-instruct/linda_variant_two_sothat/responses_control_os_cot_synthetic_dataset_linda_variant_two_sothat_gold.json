The probability of a journalist admitting to dropping the ball during a debate is not affected by the reason behind it. Therefore, the probability of (a) is the same as the probability of (b).\n\nSince (a) and (b) are equally likely, we should choose the option involving a single event as it statistically holds a higher likelihood.

We're not being asked about Zack's intentions or motivations; we're being asked about the likelihood of donations coming from specific countries.\n\nGiven that the Kickstarter has raised $11,000, it's highly likely that donations came from a large number of people, not just a few individuals. This increases the probability that donations came from multiple countries, including the UK, France, and Romania.\n\nHowever, the conjunction of the two events (\"donations came from the UK, France, and Romania\") is not necessarily more probable than the single event (\"donations came from the UK, France, and Romania\"). In fact, the probability of the single event is likely higher, as it's more plausible that donations came from multiple countries without any specific intention or motivation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Donations have come from the UK, France, and Romania.\n\nThis option is more probable because it's a single event, whereas option (b) is a conjunction of two events, which is not necessarily more likely.",

Because the probability of the Finance minister delivering the budget statement on Thursday is independent of the expected GDP reduction. The two events are unrelated, and the expected GDP reduction does not affect the likelihood of the Finance minister delivering the budget statement.\n\nIn probabilistic terms, the probability of the Finance minister delivering the budget statement on Thursday (option a) is higher than the probability of the Finance minister delivering the budget statement on Thursday because of the expected GDP reduction (option b). This is because option b introduces an additional condition that is not necessary for the Finance minister to deliver the budget statement on Thursday.\n\nSo, option (a) is statistically more probable than option (b).",

On the other hand, the probability of (b) His voice can be heard at the Baseball Hall of Fame so that his contributions to baseball history are celebrated is lower, as it's a specific and more detailed outcome.\n6.
