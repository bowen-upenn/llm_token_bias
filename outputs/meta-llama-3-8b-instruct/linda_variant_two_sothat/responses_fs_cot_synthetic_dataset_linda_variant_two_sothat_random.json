Additionally, the statement mentions the traffic jams and fast trains, which could also be affected by globalization. Therefore, option (a) seems to be a more likely explanation.\n\nOption (b) adds an extra clause about France frequently winning international rugby matches. This is not mentioned in the original statement, and it seems unrelated to the other points made about France's cheese-making and transportation systems.

She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations. Which is more probable?\n\n(a) Linda is a bank teller.\n\nThis option is more probable because Linda's background and interests do not necessarily point to a specific career, but being a bank teller is a common occupation that doesn't require a specific connection to her interests.\n\n2. The cheerleaders worked very hard on their new cheer. They were going to unveil it at the homecoming game. They worked hard for many days. Finally it was time to perform! The crowd rose to their feet and clapped and yelled at the end.\n\nWhich is more likely?\n\n(a) The protagonist would likely join the cheerleaders in their performance.\n\nThis option is more likely because the protagonist is simply watching the performance, and it's common for people to join in and participate in enthusiastic activities like cheering.\n\n3. A bruising midterm election has prompted a backlash from progressives in Congress. They see Elizabeth Warren, not President Barack Obama, as their leader.\n\nWhich is more likely?\n\n(a) They're expecting significant battles with Republicans to defend their priorities.\n\nThis option is more likely because the context of a midterm election suggests that there will be disagreements and conflicts between political parties, making it likely that progressives will face challenges in defending their priorities.\n\n4.
