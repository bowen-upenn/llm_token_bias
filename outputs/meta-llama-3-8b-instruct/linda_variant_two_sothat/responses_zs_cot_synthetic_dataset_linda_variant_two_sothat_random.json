This suggests that the incident was not a friendly or routine interaction.\n\nGiven this context, it is more likely that:\n\n(a) White House said the incident was a provocation, raised objection with Beijing\n\nThis option suggests that the White House is concerned about the aggressive behavior of the Chinese fighter jet and is expressing its disapproval to Beijing. This is a plausible response given the circumstances.\n\nOption (b) implies that the White House is raising the issue for the sake of making a statement, rather than genuinely expressing concern about the incident. This seems less likely, as the Pentagon has already described the Chinese jet's behavior as \"dangerous\" and the White House would likely want to take a strong stance on such an incident.",

This suggests that there was a violent and intense confrontation.\n\nGiven this context, I believe the more likely scenario is:\n\n(a) Two suspects died and a third is injured.\n\nThe phrase \"shootout\" implies a high level of violence, and it's more plausible that at least one or two suspects would be killed or seriously injured in such an encounter. The option (b) about a suspect missing their favorite TV show is unlikely and seems unrelated to the situation.",

This would likely result in only minor shaking on land, as reported by witnesses. There is no mention of a scheduled annual fishing festival, so option (b) is not supported by the evidence.",
