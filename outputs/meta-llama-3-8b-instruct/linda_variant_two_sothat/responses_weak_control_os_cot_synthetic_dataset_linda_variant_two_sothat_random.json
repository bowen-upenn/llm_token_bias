Zack Brown mentioned that he's never made potato salad before, and the end result might be bad.\n3. The question asks which is more likely: option (a) donations came from the UK, France, and Romania or option (b) donations came from the UK, France, and Romania so that Zack can watch his favorite movie.\n\nGiven the information, I would select option (a) donations have come from the UK, France, and Romania.\n\nReasoning: It's more plausible that donations came from various countries, including the UK, France, and Romania, simply because the Kickstarter was public and open to donations from anyone worldwide. The fact that the Kickstarter exceeded its goal and raised $11,000 suggests that many people were interested in supporting Zack's potato salad project.\n\nOption (b) donations came from the UK, France, and Romania so that Zack can watch his favorite movie is less likely because it's an unusual reason for donating to a Kickstarter project. While it's possible that some donors might have donated for personal reasons, it's not a common motivation for contributing to a project like this.\n\nSo, I think option (a) is the more likely choice.",

The article states that Brittany Zimmerman's fiance found her body, and police did not respond to her call for help for 48 minutes.\n\nFrom this information, we can infer that Brittany Zimmerman was attacked and killed. The fact that police didn't respond to her call for help for 48 minutes suggests that they were delayed or didn't take her call seriously.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\nOption (a) states that police suspect she was attacked by a stranger and are eyeing vagrants. This is a plausible explanation, given the circumstances. It's reasonable for police to investigate potential suspects, including vagrants, if they suspect a stranger was involved in the attack.\n\nOption (b) adds an additional layer of information, stating that police are eyeing vagrants so that they can redeploy resources to other unsolved cases in the area. This option introduces a new motive for the police's actions, which is not directly related to the investigation of Brittany Zimmerman's murder.\n\nGiven the available information, option (a) is more likely.
