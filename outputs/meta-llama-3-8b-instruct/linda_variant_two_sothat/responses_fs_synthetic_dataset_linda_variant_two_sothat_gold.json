Additionally, the fact that the Pentagon mentions the importance of freedom of navigation in the region suggests that the U.S. may be trying to assert its presence and interests in the South China Sea, which would be a plausible reason for the White House to issue a statement emphasizing its commitment to maintaining freedom of navigation.",
