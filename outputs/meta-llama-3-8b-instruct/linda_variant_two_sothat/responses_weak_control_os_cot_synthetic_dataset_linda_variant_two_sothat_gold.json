The scenario is described as the Pentagon saying a Chinese fighter jet was aggressive in an encounter in the South China Sea.\n2. The Pentagon claims the Chinese jet made several \"dangerous\" passes at a P-8 Navy patrol plane, coming within 20 feet at one point.\n\nGiven this information, I would select:\n\n(a) White House said the incident was a provocation, raised objection with Beijing.\n\nThis option is more likely because it's a natural response to the situation described. The Pentagon's statement implies that the Chinese fighter jet's actions were aggressive and potentially threatening. It's reasonable to assume that the White House would respond to this incident by expressing concern and raising objections with Beijing.\n\nOption (b) suggests that the White House's reaction was specifically designed to emphasize its commitment to maintaining freedom of navigation in the region. While this might be a possible motive, it's not necessarily the most likely explanation for the White House's response.",

The fact that the vice chairman is celebrating the liberation of Libyan lands suggests that the situation is chaotic and potentially unstable.
