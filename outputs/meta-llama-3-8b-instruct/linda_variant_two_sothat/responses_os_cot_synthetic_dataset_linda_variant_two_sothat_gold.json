The Pentagon reported an incident where a Chinese fighter jet was aggressive towards a P-8 Navy patrol plane in the South China Sea.\n2. The Chinese jet made several \"dangerous\" passes, and at one point, came within 20 feet of the P-8 plane.\n\nGiven these facts, it's reasonable to assume that the White House would likely respond to this incident. Here's why:\n\n(a) White House said the incident was a provocation, raised objection with Beijing\n\nThis option seems plausible, as it's likely that the White House would condemn the Chinese fighter jet's aggressive behavior and express concerns to Beijing.\n\n(b) White House said the incident was a provocation, raised objection with Beijing so that the U.S. could emphasize its commitment to maintaining freedom of navigation in the region.\n\nThis option is also plausible, but it's a more specific and detailed reason for the White House's response. It's possible that the White House might use this incident as an opportunity to reiterate its commitment to maintaining freedom of navigation in the region.\n\nConsidering the facts, I think option (a) is more likely.",

The fact that the envoy is discussing a political process to end the crisis suggests that the violence is ongoing, and this report of 116 killed is likely a consequence of that violence.\n\n(b) 116 were killed around Syria on Sunday, an opposition group reports so that the violence could be emphasized in negotiations.\n\nThis option is less likely because it implies that the opposition group intentionally reported the high number of killed to manipulate the negotiations. While it's possible that the group might want to emphasize the violence, there is no evidence to suggest that this is the case. Additionally, the envoy's statement about a political process to end the crisis suggests that the meeting was focused on finding a solution, rather than being manipulated by the opposition group.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) 116 were killed around Syria on Sunday, an opposition group reports.",
