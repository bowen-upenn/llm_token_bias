The addition of the CEO's personal interest in yacht racing (option b) is an extraneous detail that does not increase the likelihood of the event. In fact, the probability of a CEO having a personal interest in yacht racing is likely to be low and unrelated to the company's financial situation.\n\nSo, the correct answer is option (a), as it is a single event with a higher likelihood than the conjunction of multiple events in option b.",

Let's break it down:\n\n(a) Online auction begins Thursday and runs through May 22\n(b) Online auction begins Thursday and runs through May 22 so that the local wildlife can learn about lunar history\n\nThe key insight here is that the second option (b) is a conjunction of two events: the online auction begins on Thursday and runs through May 22, and the local wildlife learns about lunar history. However, the first option (a) is a single event: the online auction begins on Thursday and runs through May 22.\n\nSince the probability of a single event occurring is always higher than the probability of it occurring in conjunction with another specific event, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Online auction begins Thursday and runs through May 22\n\nThis option is statistically more probable than option (b), which is a conjunction of two events.",

We are given that there were three men who robbed a Pizza Hut in Wilmington, North Carolina, and there was a shootout between the suspects and police.\n2. We are asked to choose which option is more likely: (a) Two suspects died and a third is injured, or (b) Two suspects died and a third is injured so that he missed his favorite TV show that night.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to adopt probabilistic thinking and ignore any extraneous background information. Let's focus on the probabilistic models.\n\nThe probability of a single event occurring is always higher than the probability of it occurring in conjunction with another specific event. In this case, the event is the injury or death of the suspects.\n\nOption (a) simply states that two suspects died and a third is injured. This is a straightforward and probable outcome, given the circumstances of the shootout.\n\nOption (b) adds an additional condition: the third suspect missed his favorite TV show that night. This is an extraneous detail that does not affect the probability of the event.\n\nTherefore, option (a) is more likely because it is a more probable outcome than option (b). The probability of a single event occurring (in this case, the injury or death of the suspects) is higher than the probability of it occurring in conjunction with another specific event (in this case, the third suspect missing his favorite TV show).\n\nSo, the correct answer is (a) Two suspects died and a third is injured.",
