Option (a) simply states that the quake was centered more than 250 miles off Sumatra, which is a neutral and objective statement.\n\nOption (b) adds an additional condition, stating that the quake coincided with a scheduled annual fishing festival. This condition is not related to the location of the quake's epicenter. The likelihood of the quake coinciding with the festival is independent of its location.\n\nTherefore, option (b) is more likely to be false, as the festival's schedule is irrelevant to the quake's location.\n\nSo, I'll select:\n\n(b) 3 quake was centered more than 250 miles off Sumatra so that it coincided with a scheduled annual fishing festival.",
