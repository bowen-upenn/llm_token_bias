This is an unlikely scenario, as the Common Cold is typically characterized by mild symptoms such as runny nose, sore throat, and cough. Fever and fatigue are not typically associated with the Common Cold.\n\nOption (b) states that Alex also experiences high fever. This is also an unlikely scenario, as the Common Cold is typically characterized by mild symptoms such as runny nose, sore throat, and cough.

Hepatitis B is a viral infection that affects the liver. One of the common symptoms of Hepatitis B is yellowing of the eyes, also known as jaundice.\n2. Abdominal pain is also a common symptom of Hepatitis B, particularly in advanced stages of the disease.\n3. Given that Pat has been diagnosed with Hepatitis B, it is more likely that Pat experiences yellowing of the eyes (option a) than yellowing of the eyes and abdominal pain (option b).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) Pat experiences yellowing of the eyes.",
