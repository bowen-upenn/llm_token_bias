We are asked to compare the likelihood of two events:\n\n(a) The album receives no Grammy nominations.\n\n(b) The album receives no Grammy nominations but one of the songs becomes a number one hit on the Billboard charts.\n\nTo compare the likelihood of these two events, we need to consider the probability of each event occurring.\n\nLet's start by considering the probability of the album receiving no Grammy nominations. This is a relatively common occurrence, as many albums are released each year and not all of them receive Grammy nominations.\n\nOn the other hand, the probability of one of the songs becoming a number one hit on the Billboard charts is much lower. This is because the competition for the top spot on the Billboard charts is extremely high, and it is difficult for a song to rise to the top of the charts.\n\nBased on these probabilities, we can conclude that the event (a) the album receives no Grammy nominations is more likely to occur than the event (b) the album receives no Grammy nominations but one of the songs becomes a number one hit on the Billboard charts.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) the album receives no Grammy nominations.",

This means that there is a 60% chance that the movie will receive negative reviews.\n\nNow, let's assume that the probability of the movie becoming a box office hit despite receiving negative reviews is 0.1 (or 10%). This means that there is a 10% chance that the movie will become a box office hit despite receiving negative reviews.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the likelihood of the two statements:\n\n(a) The movie receives negative reviews. (Probability: 0.6 or 60%)\n(b) The movie receives negative reviews but goes on to become a box office hit. (Probability: 0.1 or 10%)\n\nBased on the probabilities, it is more likely that the movie will receive negative reviews (60%) than that the movie will receive negative reviews but go on to become a box office hit (10%).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) The movie receives negative reviews.",

It's a single event, and we can assume that the probability of the movie failing to make a profit is relatively low.\n\nOption (b) is a more complex statement. It's not just about the movie's financial performance but also about the record-breaking stunts. This adds an extra layer of complexity to the probability calculation.\n\nIn this case, it's more likely that the movie will fail to make a profit (Option (a))) than that it will break the record for the most stunts ever performed by an actor in a single film (Option (b)))).\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) The movie fails to make a profit.\n\nI hope this helps!

In fact, it's estimated that only about 1% of books published become bestsellers.\n\nSo, option (a) seems quite plausible.\n\nNow, let's consider option (b): His book will not make it to the bestseller list but will be critically acclaimed.\n\nThis option is less likely than option (a), as many books that are critically acclaimed do not become bestsellers.\n\nHowever, it's not impossible for a book to be critically acclaimed but not become a bestseller.\n\nSo, option (b) is less likely than option (a), but it's not impossible.\n\nBased on our analysis, we can conclude that option (a) is more likely than option (b).\n\nSo, our answer is:\n\n(a) His book will not make it to the bestseller list.",
