Tom got a scar on his cheek, which is a physical injury. It's likely that Tom would want to talk about how he got the scar, especially if it's a unique or interesting story.\n2. While it's possible that Tom might tell the story of how he got his scar to impress his friends during a gathering, it's not the most likely scenario. Tom might share the story with his friends, but it's unlikely that he would only share the story for the purpose of impressing his friends.\n\nOverall, option (a) is the more likely scenario, as Tom would likely want to talk about how he got the scar, especially if it's a unique or interesting story.",
