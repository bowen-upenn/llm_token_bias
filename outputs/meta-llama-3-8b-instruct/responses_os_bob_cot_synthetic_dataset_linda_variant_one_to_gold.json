After a few months he was able to easily do ten pull ups.\nWhich is more likely?\n(a) Mark would continue training to increase his pull-up count beyond ten.\n(b) Mark would continue training to increase his pull-up count beyond ten to achieve a new goal of twenty pull-ups.",

        "init_model_answer": "Let's break down Mark's situation step by step.\n\nMark started with a goal of being able to do 10 pull-ups. He was able to achieve this goal after following his regimen and training consistently.\n\nNow, Mark has achieved his initial goal of doing 10 pull-ups. What's next for him?\n\nOption (a) suggests that Mark would continue training to increase his pull-up count beyond 10. This is a likely outcome, as Mark has already achieved his initial goal and may want to continue challenging himself.\n\nOption (b) suggests that Mark would continue training to increase his pull-up count beyond 10 to achieve a new goal of 20 pull-ups. While this is possible, it's less likely than Mark continuing to train to increase his pull-up count beyond 10.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, it's more likely that Mark will continue training to increase his pull-up count beyond 10.",
