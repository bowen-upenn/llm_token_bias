We need to evaluate the likelihood of each event independently and then combine them using the rules of probability.\n\nLet's assume that the likelihood of the album receiving no Grammy nominations is 0.5 (or 50%). This is a reasonable assumption, as Grammy nominations are not guaranteed.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the likelihood of the second event: one of the songs becoming a number one hit on the Billboard charts. This is a more challenging event to predict, as it depends on a variety of factors, including the song's quality, the competition in the music industry, and the preferences of music fans.\n\nLet's assume that the likelihood of one of the songs becoming a number one hit on the Billboard charts is 0.2 (or 20%). This is a reasonable assumption, as the competition in the music industry is fierce, and the preferences of music fans can be unpredictable.\n\nNow, let's combine the likelihoods of the two events to determine the overall likelihood of option (b).\n\nUsing the rules of probability, we can combine the likelihoods of the two events as follows:\n\nP(option (b))) = P(event 1) \u2229 P(event 2)\n= P(event 1) \u00d7 P(event 2)\n= 0.5 \u00d7 0.2\n= 0.1\n\nSo, the overall likelihood of option (b) is 0.1 (or 10%).",
