John would continue to spend more time with Beverly so that they could plan their future together: This is a conjunction of two events: John spending more time with Beverly and planning their future together. The probability of this conjunction is the product of the probabilities of each event, assuming they are independent.\n\nLet's assume the probability of John planning their future together, given that he's spending more time with Beverly, is 0.5 (50% chance). This means that half of the time, John's intentions for spending more time with Beverly are to plan their future together.\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability of the conjunction:\n\nP(John would continue to spend more time with Beverly so that they could plan their future together) = P(John spends more time with Beverly) \u00d7 P(they plan their future together | John spends more time with Beverly)\n= 0.8 \u00d7 0.5\n= 0.4 (40% chance)\n\nComparing the two options, we can see that:\n\n* Option (a) has a higher probability (0.8) than option (b) (0.4).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) John would continue to spend more time with Beverly.",

According to the basic probability rule, the probability of the conjunction should be less than or equal to the probabilities of its constituents.
