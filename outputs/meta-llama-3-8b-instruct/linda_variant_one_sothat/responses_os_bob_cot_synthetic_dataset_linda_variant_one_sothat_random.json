This implies that the protagonist trusts raw milk to have healing properties for their cat as well.\n\nGiven these points, it's more likely that the protagonist would continue drinking raw milk and feeding it to their cat, as they seem to believe in its health benefits for both humans and animals.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) The protagonist would continue drinking raw milk and feeding it to their cat.",
