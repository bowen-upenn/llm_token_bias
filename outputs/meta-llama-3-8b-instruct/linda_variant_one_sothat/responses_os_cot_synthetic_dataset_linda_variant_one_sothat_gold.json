This is a plausible possibility, but it's not the most likely option. The protagonist's primary motivation for taking photographs is likely to capture memories of their trip, rather than to share them on social media.\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is:\n\n(a) The protagonist would likely take photographs of the landscapes and Arches in Moab, Utah.",

We need to consider the information given in the passage.\n\nJane decided to go on a low calorie diet and initially felt constantly hungry.

This means that the friend likely wore a medium shirt that was too small for them, and the protagonist wore a large shirt that was too big for them.\n\nSince the protagonist traded shirts with their friend, it's likely that they traded a large shirt for a medium shirt.

He notices that the weather influences the beauty of nature and goes to the park after a big rain to see the beautiful sunset.\n\nGiven this information, it's likely that Terence would:\n\n(a) photograph or sketch the sunset.\n\nThis is because as a naturalist, he would likely want to capture the beauty of the moment and observe it closely. He might want to study the colors, shapes, and patterns of the sunset, and photography or sketching would be a way to do that.\n\nOption (b) is less likely because while it's possible that Terence might want to share the beauty of the moment with others later, it's not necessarily a direct consequence of his actions as a naturalist. He might simply be interested in capturing the moment for his own purposes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) Terence would likely photograph or sketch the sunset.",
