Apologizing might show that Cara is taking responsibility for her actions and is willing to make amends, which could potentially soften her parents' stance.\n\nSo, the more likely option is:\n\n(b) Cara might apologize to her parents for sneaking out so that they might consider reducing her grounding period.",
