Sadie then told the kid who was making fun of him that he was a bully, which made him and his friends storm off.\n\nTo answer the question, we need to focus on the probabilistic models and ignore the narrative context.

This option is a combination of two specific events, which makes it less likely than the single event in option (a).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Sadie would comfort the boy who was crying.\n\nThis is because the probability of a single event occurring (Sadie comforting the boy) is higher than the probability of two specific events occurring together (Sadie comforting the boy so that he feels better and not alone).",

In this case, we're given that Tiara gets a kitten from a local shelter. We can assume that getting a kitten from a local shelter is a random event, and that Tiara's actions (taking care of the kitten or not) are independent of the event of getting a kitten.\n\nSince Tiara has already gotten a kitten, it's a fact that she now has a kitten. The question is asking which is more likely: taking care of the kitten or taking care of the kitten so that it stays healthy and happy.\n\nFrom a probabilistic perspective, taking care of the kitten is a necessary condition for taking care of the kitten so that it stays healthy and happy. In other words, if Tiara takes care of the kitten, then it's more likely that the kitten will stay healthy and happy. But taking care of the kitten is not the only way to ensure the kitten's health and happiness - there are many other factors that could contribute to this outcome.\n\nGiven that Tiara has already gotten a kitten, the probability of taking care of the kitten is not conditional on any other event. Therefore, the probability of taking care of the kitten is 1, since it's a fact that she now has a kitten.\n\nIn contrast, the probability of taking care of the kitten so that it stays healthy and happy is not 1, since there are many other factors that could affect the kitten's health and happiness.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Tiara takes care of her new kitten.\n\nThis answer is statistically more probable because taking care of the kitten is a necessary condition for taking care of the kitten so that it stays healthy and happy, and given that Tiara has already gotten a kitten, taking care of the kitten is a fact.",

The additional condition \"so that he could teach it new tricks\" makes the event less probable, as it's a specific goal that may not be achieved every time Jasper plays fetch.\n\nTherefore, I choose option (a) Jasper would play fetch with his dog as the more likely event.",
