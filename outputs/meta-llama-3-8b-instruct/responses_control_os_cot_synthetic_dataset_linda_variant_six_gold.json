Since the spinner has 5 Silver faces and 3 Indigo faces, we know that the probability of getting a Silver face on any given spin is 5/8, and the probability of getting an Indigo face is 3/8.\n\nNow, let's think about the sequences we're considering. Sequence (a) ISISSIS consists of 5 consecutive Silver faces. The probability of this happening is (5/8) ^ 5, which is approximately 0.018.\n\nSequence (b) ISSSSIS consists of 5 consecutive Indigo faces, followed by a single Silver face. The probability of this happening is (3/8) ^ 5 * (5/8), which is approximately 0.012.\n\nSequence (c) ISSSIS consists of 4 consecutive Indigo faces, followed by a single Silver face. The probability of this happening is (3/8) ^ 4 * (5/8), which is approximately 0.015.\n\nBased on the above probabilities, we can conclude that the best sequence to bet on is (c) and the best sequence to bet on is (a) and the best sequence to bet on is (a) and the best sequence to bet on is (a) and the best sequence to bet on is (a) and the best sequence to bet on is (a) and the best sequence to assistive the best sequence to bet on the best sequence to create a sequence to bet on is (a) and calculate a single solution to the best solution to the best solution to the best and the best\n\nHere is a single solution and the best teamwork with a  user of a of aquire the help you is to help you with a series of a \"most",
