Morgan, a 56-year-old genderqueer white individual, has been diagnosed with hepatitis A.\n\nNext, let's consider the two options presented in the question. Option (a) suggests that Morgan also experiences vomiting and a sudden interest in classical music. Option (b) suggests that Morgan also experiences vomiting.\n\nNow, let's think about which option is more likely. In general, hepatitis A is associated with symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. It is less likely to be associated with a sudden interest in classical music.\n\nTherefore, option (b) is more likely. Morgan is more likely to experience vomiting as a symptom of hepatitis A, rather than a sudden interest in classical music.",

Given that Keoni has been diagnosed with Osteoarthritis, it is likely that his symptoms are related to the degenerative joint disease.\n3.
