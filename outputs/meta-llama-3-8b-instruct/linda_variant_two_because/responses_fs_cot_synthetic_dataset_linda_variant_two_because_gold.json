Since Linda is a single, outspoken, and very bright individual who majored in philosophy and was concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, it is more probable that she is not a bank teller. Bank tellers are typically not associated with these characteristics. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Linda is a bank teller.\n\nFor the second question, we need to consider the probability of each sequence occurring. Since the spinner has five pink faces and three red faces, the probability of getting a pink face is 5/8, and the probability of getting a red face is 3/8. The sequence PPRPRR has three pink faces and two red faces, which is a reasonable combination given the probabilities.
