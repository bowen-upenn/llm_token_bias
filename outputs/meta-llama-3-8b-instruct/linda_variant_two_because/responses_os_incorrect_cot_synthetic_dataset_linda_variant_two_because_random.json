This suggests that the club is looking for new sponsors, and it's likely that they have been approached by other companies interested in partnering with them. The mention of India's Sahara and Saudi Telecom as potential sponsors is a plausible scenario, as they are large companies with the resources to sponsor a major sports team like Manchester United.\n\nOption (b) is less likely because there is no evidence to suggest that the color blue is a specific requirement for Manchester United's sponsors. It's possible that the club is looking for sponsors with specific values or goals that align with their own, but the color of their logos is not mentioned as a factor.",
