It's a straightforward promise about the company's intentions to address the oil disaster.\n\nOption (b) \"We will get this done because he feels confident wearing his lucky socks\" is an example of a conjunction fallacy. It's trying to connect the feeling of confidence (wearing lucky socks) to the likelihood of success, which is an irrelevant and nonsensical connection. The feeling of confidence or wearing lucky socks has no bearing on the company's ability to address the oil disaster.\n\nSo, I select option (a) as the more likely statement.",

It's a common phenomenon for luxury properties to be developed in areas with growing economies and attractive business environments. The fact that international hotel brands and developers are flocking to RAK suggests that the emirate is attractive for investment and development.\n\nOn the other hand, statement (b) is a conditional statement that links the developers' actions to the local cuisine and weather. While these factors might be pleasant, they are not directly related to the economic development of the emirate. It's unlikely that the developers would be drawn to RAK solely because of the local cuisine and weather.\n\nTherefore, option (a) is more likely to be true, as it is a straightforward and plausible claim about the emirate's economic development.",
