Both events are factual and have already occurred.\n\n(b) Russia was awarded the 2018 World Cup while Qatar will hold the event in 2022 because the moon is made of green cheese and pigs can fly.\n\nThis option is a conjunction of two independent events: Russia being awarded the 2018 World Cup and Qatar hosting the 2022 World Cup, plus two absurd and impossible events: the moon being made of green cheese and pigs being able to fly. These two additional events are not factual and are not related to the original events.\n\nSince the probability of a conjunction is always less than or equal to the probabilities of its constituents, option (a) is more likely because it only involves factual and independent events. The additional absurd events in option (b) make it less probable.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Russia was awarded the 2018 World Cup while Qatar will hold the event in 2022.",
