The correct approach is to evaluate the likelihood of each option independently.\n\nOption (a) states that mudslides will remain a threat for the next few days. This is a straightforward and plausible statement, as mudslides are a common occurrence in areas prone to heavy rainfall.\n\nOption (b) adds an unnecessary condition that is unrelated to the likelihood of mudslides. The fact that a local grocery store is offering a buy one, get one free deal on avocados does not affect the probability of mudslides.\n\nGiven the same probability of mudslides regardless of the avocado deal, option (a) is more likely to be true. The correct answer is:\n\n(a) Mudslides will remain a threat for the next few days",
