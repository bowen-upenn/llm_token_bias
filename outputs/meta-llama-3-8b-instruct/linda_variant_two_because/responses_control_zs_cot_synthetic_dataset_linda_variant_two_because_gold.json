The event \"Only one Thai has previously competed at the Winter Olympics\" is a single event, whereas the event \"Only one Thai has previously competed at the Winter Olympics because the number of Thai athletes at the Winter Olympics is limited\" is a conjunction of two events.\n2. According to the basic probability rule, the probability of a conjunction (P(A and B)) is always less than or equal to the probabilities of its constituents (P(A) or P(B)).\n3. Since both options are equally likely to be true or false, I'll assume that the probability of \"Only one Thai has previously competed at the Winter Olympics\" is 50%.\n4. Now, let's consider the conjunction \"Only one Thai has previously competed at the Winter Olympics because the number of Thai athletes at the Winter Olympics is limited\". This conjunction implies that there is a specific reason why only one Thai athlete has competed at the Winter Olympics, which reduces the probability of this event.\n5. Given that Vanessa Mae is a qualified athlete and will compete under a different name, it's possible that she might be the only Thai athlete competing at the Winter Olympics. However, this doesn't change the fact that the conjunction is still less likely than the single event.\n\nBased on these steps, I would choose option (a) \"Only one Thai has previously competed at the Winter Olympics\" as it is more likely to occur than the conjunction.",
