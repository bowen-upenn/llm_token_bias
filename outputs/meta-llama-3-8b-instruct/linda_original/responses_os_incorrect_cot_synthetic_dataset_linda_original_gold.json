She has degrees in Environmental Science and Public Policy from the University of Washington. She is passionate about preserving natural landscapes and leading local initiatives to protect indigenous flora and fauna. Additionally, she participates in workshops that teach younger generations the significance of ecological sustainability through traditional Native American practices.\n\nConsidering these facts, it's highly unlikely that Samantha is a dishwasher. Dishwashing is a job that requires minimal education and expertise, which contradicts Samantha's educational background and professional focus on environmental sustainability.\n\nOn the other hand, it's highly probable that Samantha participates in workshops that teach younger generations the significance of ecological sustainability through traditional Native American practices, given her passion for community development, environmental conservation, and her Native American heritage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Samantha is a dishwasher.\n\n(Note: This answer is actually incorrect, as Samantha is unlikely to be a dishwasher given her educational background and professional focus on environmental sustainability. The correct answer would be \"neither\" or \"neither is more probable\", as Samantha's characteristics and actions are not consistent with being a dishwasher.)",
