Therefore, the probability of Jordan being a mechanical engineer and practicing calligraphy is simply the product of the probabilities of these two events:\n\nP(Jordan is a mechanical engineer and practices calligraphy) = P(Jordan is a mechanical engineer) \u00d7 P(Jordan practices calligraphy)\n\nSince both events are independent, the probability of Jordan practicing calligraphy is not affected by their profession. Therefore, the probability of Jordan practicing calligraphy is roughly the same as the probability of a randomly selected person practicing calligraphy.\n\nGiven that Jordan is a professional, the probability of them being a mechanical engineer is relatively high. However, the probability of them practicing calligraphy is still relatively low, as it's a specific skill that requires dedication and practice.\n\nIn conclusion, the probability of Jordan being a mechanical engineer (option a) is higher than the probability of Jordan being a mechanical engineer and practicing calligraphy (option b).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Jordan is a mechanical engineer.",
