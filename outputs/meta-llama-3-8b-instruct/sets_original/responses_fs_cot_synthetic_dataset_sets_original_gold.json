Therefore some belts are made of leather. (Conclusion)\n\nTo determine if this is logically sound, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that all belts are accessories. This means that every belt is an accessory.\n\nThe second premise states that some accessories are made of leather. This means that there are accessories that are made of leather, but it doesn't specify which ones.\n\nNow, let's look at the conclusion. It states that some belts are made of leather. This conclusion seems to follow logically from the premises.\n\n* All belts are accessories (Premise 1)\n* Some accessories are made of leather (Premise 2)\n* Therefore, some belts (which are accessories) are made of leather (Conclusion)\n\nBased on the premises, it seems that the conclusion is indeed logically sound. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nYes",
