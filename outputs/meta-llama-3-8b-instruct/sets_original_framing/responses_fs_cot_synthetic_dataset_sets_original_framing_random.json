It's an opinion or claim made by an unverified source.\n2. \"Unsubstantiated research from a lesser-known online forum suggests that a selection of these materials are inherently bendable.\"\n\t* This is another statement, but it's also unsubstantiated and lacks credible evidence.\n3. \"Therefore, the assertion was made that some manner of flexibility can be found among different types of rubbers.\"\n\t* This is the conclusion, but it's not logically sound.\n\nThe argument is trying to connect the claim about rubbers being in a distinct group of materials with the unsubstantiated research about bendable materials. However, there's no logical connection between these two statements. The conclusion is not logically supported by the premises.\n\nSo, to answer your question: No, this argument is not logically sound.",
