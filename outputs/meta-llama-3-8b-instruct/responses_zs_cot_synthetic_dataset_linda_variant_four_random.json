Sarah is a monarch, which means she has a certain level of historical significance.\n2. The book is a personal memoir, which means it is likely to be a more personal and introspective work than a traditional biography or historical account.\n3. The book is likely to be written from the perspective of the monarch, which means it is likely to be a more personal and subjective account than a traditional historical account.\n\nGiven these points, I would argue that option (b) is more likely than option (a).

This is a less likely scenario, as even mediocre movies often receive some kind of award or recognition.\n\nOption (b) suggests that the movie wins no awards, but becomes a box office hit. This is a more likely scenario, as even movies that don't receive awards can still be successful at the box office.\n\nBased on these considerations, I would say that option (b) is more likely: the movie wins no awards, but becomes a box office hit.",
