However, the proportion of G and M sections varies across the three sequences.\n\nNow, let's think about the probability of each sequence appearing on successive spins of the spinner. Since the spinner has 5 green sections and 3 magenta sections, the probability of each section being selected is 5/8 for green and 3/8 for magenta.\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability of each sequence appearing on successive spins of the spinner. We can do this by multiplying the probabilities of each section in the sequence.\n\nFor example, let's calculate the probability of sequence (a) MMMGMMMG:\n\nP(MMMGMMMG) = P(M) \u00d7 P(M) \u00d7 P(G) \u00d7 P(M) \u00d7 P(M) \u00d7 P(G)\n= (3/8) \u00d7 (3/8) \u00d7 (5/8) \u00d7 (3/8) \u00d7 (3/8) \u00d7 (5/8)\n= (3/8) \u00d7 (3/8) \u00d7 (5/8) \u00d7 (27/64)\n= (243/4096)\n\nSimilarly, we can calculate the probability of each sequence appearing on successive spins of the spinner.\n\nNow, let's compare the probabilities of each sequence. We can do this by comparing the fractions of each sequence.\n\nFor example, let's compare the fractions of sequences (a) and (b):\n\nP(a) = 243/4096\nP(b) =? (we need to calculate it)\n\nTo compare the fractions, we can divide the numerator of one fraction by the numerator of the other fraction, and then multiply by the denominator of the other fraction.\n\nFor example, let's compare the fractions of sequences (a) and (b):\n\nP(a) = 243/4096\nP(b)",

The probability of getting 4 consecutive pinks is (5/8) \u00d7 (4/8) \u00d7 (3/8) \u00d7 (2/8) = 1/2048, which is still a relatively low probability.\n\n(c) CPPPCCC: This sequence has 4 consecutive cyans, which is also a relatively low probability event.
