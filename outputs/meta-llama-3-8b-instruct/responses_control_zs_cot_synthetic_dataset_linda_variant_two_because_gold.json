While RAK is often overlooked in favor of more prominent emirates like Dubai and Abu Dhabi, it has been actively promoting itself as a tourist destination and business hub.\n\nRAK's strategic location on the northernmost tip of the UAE, with easy access to the Arabian Gulf and the international trade routes, makes it an attractive location for international hotel brands and developers.\n\nIn addition, RAK's government has been actively promoting the emirate as a tourist destination and business hub, with a range of initiatives and incentives aimed at attracting international investment and talent.\n\nIn light of this information, it is likely that international hotel brands and developers are flocking to RAK to build new facilities and residences, driven by the emirate's strategic location, potential for high returns on investment, and government support for tourism and business development.",
