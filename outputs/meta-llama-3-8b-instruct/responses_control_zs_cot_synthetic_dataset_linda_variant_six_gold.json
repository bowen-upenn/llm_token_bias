If the sequence we choose appears on successive spins of the spinner, we will win $30.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the problem**\nSince the spinner has 5 silver sectors and 3 navy sectors, the probability of each sector is:\n\n* Silver sector (S): 5/8 = 0.625\n* Navy sector (N): 3/8 = 0.375\n\nSince the spinner will be spun 30 times, the expected frequency of each sector can be calculated as:\n\n* Silver sector (S): 30 x 0.625 = 18.75\n* Navy sector (N): 30 x 0.375 = 11.25\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the options**\nNow that we have calculated the expected frequency of each sector, we can evaluate the options:\n\n* Option (a) SNSS: The expected frequency of this sequence is 18.75 (silver) x 0.375 (navy) = 7.03125.

We are asked to choose one sequence from three options. The goal is to win $50 if the chosen sequence appears on successive spins of the spinner.\n\nNow, let's think about the probability of each sequence. Since each spin is an independent event, the probability of each sequence is the product of the probabilities of its individual segments.\n\nFor example, let's analyze sequence (a) TGGTGTGTG. We can break it down into individual segments:\n\n* T (teal segment): probability = 5/8\n* G (green segment): probability = 3/8\n* T (teal segment): probability = 5/8\n* G (green segment): probability = 3/8\n* T (teal segment): probability = 5/8\n* G (green segment): probability = 3/8\n\nThe probability of sequence (a) TGGTGTGTG is the product of the probabilities of its individual segments:\n\nprobability = (5/8) \u00d7 (3/8) \u00d7 (5/8) \u00d7 (3/8) \u00d7 (5/8) \u00d7 (3/8)\n= 375/4096\n\u2248 0.091\n\nSo, the probability of sequence (a) TGGTGTGTG is approximately 9.1%.\n\nLet's analyze the other two sequences.\n\nSequence (b) TGGTGGTG has the same probability as sequence (a) TGGTGTGTG, since the two sequences have the same pattern of teal and green segments.\n\nSequence (c) TGGTGGGTG has a different pattern of teal and green segments than sequences (a) and (b). Therefore, the probability of sequence (c) TGGTGGGTG is different from the probabilities of sequences (a) and (b).\n\nI hope this helps you understand the problem better.",

We know that the spinner has 5 lavender zones and 3 indigo zones. We also know that the sequence of lavender and indigo outcomes will be recorded.\n\nNow, let's think about the probability of each sequence. We know that the spinner is fair, so each zone has an equal probability of being selected.\n\nLet's start by calculating the probability of each sequence. We can do this by multiplying the probabilities of each zone in the sequence.\n\nFor example, let's calculate the probability of the sequence \"ILIILL\". We can do this by multiplying the probabilities of each zone in the sequence:\n\nP(ILIILL) = P(I) x P(L) x P(I) x P(L) x P(L)\n\nUsing the fact that each zone has an equal probability of being selected, we can simplify the calculation:\n\nP(ILIILL) = (1/8) x (1/8) x (1/8) x (1/8) x (1/8) x (1/8)\n\nP(ILIILL) = (1/4096)\n\nSo, the probability of the sequence \"ILIILL\" is 1/4096.\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability of each of the other two sequences:\n\nP(ILIIL) = (1/8) x (1/8) x (1/8) x (1/8) x (1/8)\n\nP(ILIIL) = (1/4096)\n\nP(IIIIIL) = (1/8) x (1/8) x (1/8) x (1/8) x (1/8) x (1/8) x (1/8)\n\nP(IIIIIL) = (1/32768)\n\nNow, let's compare the probabilities of each sequence.
