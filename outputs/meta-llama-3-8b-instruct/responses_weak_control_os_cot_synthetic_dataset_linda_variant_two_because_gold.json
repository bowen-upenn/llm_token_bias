This option does not provide any additional information or context.\n\nOption (b) provides additional context by stating that Israel fears any aid would bolster Hamas because it would violate existing sanctions against the terrorist organization. This option provides a clearer understanding of the reasons behind Israel's concerns.\n\nBased on this analysis, I would say that option (b) is more likely to be true.",
