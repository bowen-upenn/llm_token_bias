The question asks which option is more likely: (a) Lisa would likely plan another trip to a new destination or (b) Lisa would likely plan another trip to a new destination because she wants to continue exploring different cultures and capturing her experiences in photographs.\n\n2. Option (a) is a standalone statement that only mentions Lisa planning another trip to a new destination. It doesn't provide any additional context or information about Lisa's motivations.\n\n3. Option (b) is a conjunction of two statements: Lisa planning another trip to a new destination and her desire to continue exploring different cultures and capturing her experiences in photographs.\n\n4. The key point here is that option (b) provides additional information that is not present in option (a). Option (b) is a more specific and detailed statement about Lisa's motivations and interests.\n\n5. Since option (b) provides more information, it's actually a more specific and detailed description of Lisa's likely behavior. Therefore, option (b) is more likely to be true.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n(b) The protagonist, Lisa, would likely plan another trip to a new destination because she wants to continue exploring different cultures and capturing her experiences in photographs.",

We know that the kids loved doing art, and they drew all over the markerboard in their basement. They used neon markers to make intricate designs. When the board was full, they washed it off. They made drawings every day!\n\nFrom this information, we can infer that the kids enjoyed using neon markers and creating intricate designs. Option (a) is a more general statement that simply states the kids would likely draw more intricate designs using neon markers. This is a true statement, as the passage does describe the kids making intricate designs with neon markers.\n\nOption (b) is a more specific statement that suggests the kids drew intricate designs because they enjoyed the vibrant colors produced by the neon markers. While this might be a reason why the kids enjoyed drawing, it's not the only reason. The passage doesn't explicitly state that the kids only drew intricate designs because of the colors. They might have drawn intricate designs for other reasons as well.\n\nTherefore, I would select:\n\n(a) The protagonist would likely draw more intricate designs using neon markers.\n\nThis option is more likely because it's a more general statement that is supported by the passage, whereas option (b) is a more specific statement that is not necessarily supported by the passage.",

It's natural for Abigail to apologize to her friends for the inconvenience caused, regardless of whether she feels responsible for everyone having less to eat.\n\nLet's analyze the other option:\n\n(b) Abigail would apologize to her friends for dropping the hot dogs because she felt responsible for everyone having less to eat.\n\nThis option assumes that Abigail's motivation for apologizing is specifically because she feels responsible for the consequences of her action. While it's possible that Abigail might feel responsible, it's not the only reason she might apologize. She might simply apologize as a courtesy or to maintain social harmony. Therefore, option (a) seems more plausible.",

The fact that Cary wants the total number of children to be a \"clean number\" is already implied by his previous statement, and we don't need to assume that he's making this decision because of that reason.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (a) Cary would insist on having two additional children after the third, which is a direct consequence of his obsession with \"clean numbers\".",

It doesn't provide any additional context or motivation for Ken's actions.\n\n(b) Ken might start a diet or buy new clothes that fit better because he felt embarrassed when his jeans tore in public.\n\nThis option adds an additional detail, which is that Ken felt embarrassed when his jeans tore in public. This detail provides a motivation for Ken's actions, implying that his embarrassment drove him to consider changing his appearance.\n\nGiven that the second option provides more specific and relevant context, I would select:\n\n(b) Ken might start a diet or buy new clothes that fit better because he felt embarrassed when his jeans tore in public.\n\nThis option is more likely to happen to Ken because it takes into account his emotional response to the situation and provides a plausible motivation for his actions.",
