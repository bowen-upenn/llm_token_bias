Therefore, it's likely that they would buy more pink paper in the future if it's available at a good price.\n\n(b) The protagonist would likely buy more pink paper because it was favorably received by potential employers.\n\nThis option seems less plausible. The fact that the employers were impressed with the pink paper doesn't necessarily mean that the protagonist would buy more of it. The protagonist might have bought it because it was on sale, or because they liked the color, not because of the employers' reaction.
