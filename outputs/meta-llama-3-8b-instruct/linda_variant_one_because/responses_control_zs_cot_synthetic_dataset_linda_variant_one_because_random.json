It's a straightforward scenario where Jack has the opportunity to try the pizza, and it's likely that he will, given that he didn't bring his lunch.\n\n(b) Jack might try the pizza in the cafeteria because it was raining earlier that day.\n\nThis option is less likely because it's a conjunction of two events: Jack trying the pizza and it being raining earlier that day. The probability of this conjunction is lower than the probability of Jack trying the pizza alone.

The event \"Paul would play with his hermit crab because it was raining outside\" is a conjunction of two events: \"Paul would play with his hermit crab\" and \"it was raining outside\".\n\nAccording to the basic probability rule, the probability of a conjunction (P(A and B)) is always less than or equal to the probabilities of its constituents (P(A) or P(B)). In this case, the probability of \"Paul would play with his hermit crab because it was raining outside\" is lower than the probability of \"Paul would play with his hermit crab\" because the additional condition \"it was raining outside\" reduces the likelihood.\n\nTherefore, I would choose option (a) \"Paul would play with his hermit crab\" as it is more likely to occur than the conjunction of the two events.",

This is a reasonable and plausible event, as many people might frame an autographed item as a keepsake.\n\nOption (b) states that Ben might frame the autographed shirt to preserve the memory because he recently learned how to cook Italian cuisine. This option is less likely because it introduces an extraneous and unrelated event (learning to cook Italian cuisine) that is not relevant to the situation.\n\nFrom a probabilistic perspective, the probability of Ben framing the autographed shirt to preserve the memory (option a) is higher because it is a more plausible and common event. The probability of Ben framing the autographed shirt because he learned to cook Italian cuisine (option b) is lower because it is an unlikely and unrelated event.\n\nTherefore, I choose option (a) as the more likely event.",
