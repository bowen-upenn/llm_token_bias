It's not just a simple malfunction that would resolve itself after a few minutes of waiting. It's possible that there's a problem with the car's electrical system, fuel injection, or another critical component.\n\nGiven this information, it's more likely that Antonio would visit a mechanic to check his car.

The question also mentions that the cheerleaders worked hard on their new cheer, and the protagonist doesn't have any connection to the cheerleaders or their performance. This makes it even less likely that the protagonist would join the cheerleaders.\n\nLet's reconsider the options:\n\n(a) The protagonist would likely join the cheerleaders in their performance. (Still not a good fit)\n\n(b) The protagonist would likely join the cheerleaders in their performance because they had recently learned a new recipe for chocolate chip cookies. (Ha! This is clearly not the case)\n\nGiven the lack of connection between the protagonist and the cheerleaders, I would select:\n\n(b) The protagonist would likely join the cheerleaders in their performance because they had recently learned a new recipe for chocolate chip cookies.\n\nThis option is more absurd and less likely to occur, making it the correct answer.",
