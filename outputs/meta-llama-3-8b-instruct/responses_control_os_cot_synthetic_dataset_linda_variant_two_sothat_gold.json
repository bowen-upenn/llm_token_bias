This is a specific job that Linda has. The probability of Linda being a bank teller is relatively high, as this is a common job that many people hold.\n\nOption (b) states that Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement. This option adds an additional condition to the original statement. The probability of Linda being a bank teller and being active in the feminist movement is lower than the probability of Linda being a bank teller alone, as this additional condition makes the overall event less likely.\n\nTherefore, option (a) is more likely than option (b).",

This statement is likely true, as Michelle Obama was the First Lady of the United States during the presidency of Barack Obama, and it would be consistent with her role as First Lady to participate in events like the Oscars.\n\n3. The options (a) and (b) are both plausible, but option (b) is more likely because it provides a clear purpose for Michelle Obama's participation in the Oscars.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (b) She was just one example of where politics met Hollywood this awards season so that she could emphasize the importance of arts in education.",

This is because hormonal changes can affect metabolism, appetite, and body composition.\n\nGiven this information, we can conclude that option (b) is more likely to be true.
