Both (a) and (b) include the statement \"The first flight is expected to take off in three years,\" so we need to consider the additional information in option (b): \"to offer panoramic views and zero-gravity experience for passengers.\"\n\nGiven the information provided about the luxury capsule traveling to the edge of space, it is reasonable to expect that it would offer panoramic views. The capsule being lifted by a high altitude balloon to a height of about 30 kilometers would naturally provide such views.\n\nAs for the zero-gravity experience, it's not explicitly stated in the information provided, but it's also not unlikely. The edge of space is where the Earth's atmosphere meets outer space, and it's possible to experience zero gravity or microgravity in such an environment.\n\nTherefore, both the panoramic views and the zero-gravity experience are plausible and do not make option (b) less probable than option (a). However, as a general rule, when considering the probability of two statements where one includes additional details (like option (b) in this case), the statement with fewer details (option (a)) is usually more probable. This is because each additional detail introduces another condition that must be true, and the more conditions that must be true, the less likely the overall statement is to be true.\n\nHowever, in this case, the additional details in option (b) are not unlikely given the context, so both options (a) and (b) are equally probable. But since the question asks for the most likely option, and the additional details in option (b) do not decrease its probability, the correct answer is (b) \"The first flight is expected to take off in three years to offer panoramic views and zero-gravity experience for passengers.\"",
