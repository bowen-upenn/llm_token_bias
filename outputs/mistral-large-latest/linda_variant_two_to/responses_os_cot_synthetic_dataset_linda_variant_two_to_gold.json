While this is possible, it adds a level of specificity that is not present in option (a).\n\nIn general, when considering the probability of two events, the more conditions that need to be met, the less likely the event.

Therefore, both (a) and (b) could be possible.\n\nHowever, option (b) adds an additional layer of specificity by suggesting a motive (to demonstrate solidarity with democratic movements). While this is possible, it's less likely than the simpler option (a) without further evidence or information. Therefore, based on the principle of parsimony (or Occam's Razor), which suggests that the simplest explanation is usually the correct one, I would select (a) as the more likely option.",
