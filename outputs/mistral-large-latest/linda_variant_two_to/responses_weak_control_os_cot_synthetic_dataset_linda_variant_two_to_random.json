This is an example of the conjunction fallacy, where people tend to assume that a specific condition is more probable than a general one. In reality, the probability of two events happening together (in this case, Kepler finding a planet candidate and that planet being mentioned in a popular science fiction novel) is always less than or equal to the probability of each event happening individually.",
