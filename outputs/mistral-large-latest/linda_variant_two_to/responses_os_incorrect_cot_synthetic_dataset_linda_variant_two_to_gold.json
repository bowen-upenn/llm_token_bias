The Organizer's statement \"Some traditionally Democratic Jews reluctant to support Obama\" further supports the idea that there are indeed some Jewish Democrats who are hesitant to support Obama.\n3. Therefore, it is more likely that among the 650,000 Jews in Florida, many of them Democrats, some would be hesitant in supporting Obama due to his policies.",
