This is a plausible scenario given that game developers often optimize their games for new device specifications.\n\n(b) Games taking advantage of screen size will include Vainglory, Asphalt 8 to include a free coffee coupon. This option suggests that the games Vainglory and Asphalt 8 will not only utilize the larger screen size but also include a free coffee coupon. This is less likely as it's uncommon for mobile games to offer real-world items like coffee coupons.\n\nTherefore, the more likely scenario is (a) Games taking advantage of screen size will include Vainglory, Asphalt 8.",
