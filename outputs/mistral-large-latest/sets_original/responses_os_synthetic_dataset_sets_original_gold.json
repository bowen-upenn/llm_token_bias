This means that every chip is a snack.\n2. Premise 2: Some snacks are high in salt. This means that there are certain snacks that have high salt content.\n3. Conclusion: Therefore, some chips are high in salt. This conclusion follows logically from the premises, as it is possible that some of the snacks that are high in salt are chips, considering all chips are snacks.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this argument relies on the assumption that the chips being referred to are among the snacks that are high in salt. In real life, this might not always be the case, but from a purely logical standpoint, the argument is sound.",
