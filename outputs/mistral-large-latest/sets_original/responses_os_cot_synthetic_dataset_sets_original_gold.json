Therefore, some police officers are specially trained in cybersecurity.\n\nThis is because if all police officers are law enforcement agents, and some law enforcement agents have a particular trait (in this case, being specially trained in cybersecurity), then it must be true that some police officers also have that trait.\n\nThis reasoning follows the valid logical form known as \"syllogism.\" A syllogism is a kind of logical argument that applies deductive reasoning to arrive at a conclusion based on two or more propositions that are asserted or assumed to be true. In this case, it's an example of a \"categorical syllogism,\" which deals with relations between categories or classes of objects.\n\nThe specific form of this syllogism is known as \"Barbara,\" one of the valid moods in the first figure of syllogisms in Aristotelian logic. The structure of a Barbara syllogism is as follows:\n\n- Major premise: All M are P.\n- Minor premise: All S are M.\n- Conclusion: Therefore, all S are P.\n\nIn this case, the major premise is \"All law enforcement agents are law enforcement agents\" (which is implicit and not stated in the argument), the minor premise is \"All police officers are law enforcement agents,\" and the conclusion is \"Therefore, some police officers are specially trained in cybersecurity.\"\n\nSince the argument follows a valid logical form, and its premises are true, the conclusion must also be true, making the argument logically sound.",

Therefore, some ducks migrate long distances. (Conclusion)\n\nThe argument follows the valid form of syllogism called Darapti (AAI-3 in the traditional classification):\n\n1. All P are Q.\n2. Some Q are R.\n3. Therefore, some P are R.\n\nIn this case, P represents ducks, Q represents birds, and R represents birds that migrate long distances. Since some birds (Q) that migrate long distances (R) can be part of the group of birds that are ducks (P), it is logically possible and sound to conclude that some ducks migrate long distances.",
