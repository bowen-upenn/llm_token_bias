However, there's no information given about him wanting to impress someone or anyone else's knowledge about the accident. Therefore, we can infer that Zack might want to repair or restore his car due to his affection for it, but we cannot assume that he would do it to impress someone who doesn't know about the accident as suggested in option (b).",
