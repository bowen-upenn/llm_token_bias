The common symptoms of TB include coughing that lasts three or more weeks, chest pain, coughing up blood, fever, chills, night sweats, fatigue, loss of appetite, and unintentional weight loss. While malaise (a general feeling of discomfort, illness, or lack of well-being) is a common symptom of TB, vomiting is not typically associated with the disease unless it's a side effect of the medications used to treat TB or the person has TB that has spread to other parts of the body, such as the digestive system.
