However, hypothyroidism is known to cause symptoms such as cold hands and feet due to slowed metabolism and reduced blood flow. It can also lead to brittle nails as a result of hormonal imbalances affecting nail growth and health. Therefore, option (b) \"He experiences cold hands and feet and has brittle nails\" could be more inclusive and likely, given the range of symptoms associated with hypothyroidism. However, it's important to note that individual symptoms can vary greatly among patients with hypothyroidism.",

These symptoms can cause a loss of fluids and electrolytes, leading to dehydration. While sunken eyes can be a sign of severe dehydration, especially in children, it's not a common symptom in adults. Therefore, it's more likely that Morgan would experience dehydration without necessarily having sunken eyes. However, it's important to note that individual symptoms can vary, and anyone experiencing severe symptoms should seek medical attention.",
