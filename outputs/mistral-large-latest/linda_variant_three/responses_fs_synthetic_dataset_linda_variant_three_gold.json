While some people with migraines may also experience neck pain or stiffness, this is not a defining characteristic of the condition. Therefore, it is more likely that Jacob experiences a headache as a result of his migraines, rather than both a headache and a stiff neck.",

Some people may also experience nausea, vomiting, and a general feeling of being unwell. In some cases, Dengue can progress to a more severe form of the disease known as Dengue hemorrhagic fever, which can cause bleeding from the nose, gums, and under the skin, as well as low blood pressure, shock, and organ failure. The presence of red spots over the body and chills are consistent with the symptoms of Dengue, making option (a) the more likely choice.",

        "init_model_answer": "The correct answer is (a) He also experiences weakness of one body side.\n\nThe principle here is that, in probability theory, the conjunction of two events is always less likely than either of the individual events. So, for example, the probability of Linda being a bank teller is higher than the probability of her being both a bank teller and active in the feminist movement. Similarly, the probability of a person with paralysis due to a brain hemorrhage experiencing weakness on one side of the body is higher than the probability of them experiencing both weakness on one side and a headache. This is because the second option adds an additional condition that must be met, which reduces the overall probability.",
