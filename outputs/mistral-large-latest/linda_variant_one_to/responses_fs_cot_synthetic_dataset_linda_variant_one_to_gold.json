Tom's sister mentioned that her husband loves Alabama.\n2. Tom interpreted this as a reference to the state or the music group, Alabama, and bought an Alabama CD.\n3. However, all the other gifts had a \"Roll Tide\" theme, which is associated with the University of Alabama Crimson Tide football team.\n4. Realizing his mistake, Tom would likely apologize for the misunderstanding and offer to exchange the gift for something related to the Alabama Crimson Tide football team, as this would be more in line with what the husband actually loves.",
