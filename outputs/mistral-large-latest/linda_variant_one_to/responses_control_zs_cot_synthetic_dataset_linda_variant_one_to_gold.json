To avoid the conjunction fallacy, we need to focus on the probabilities of the individual events, not the details of the story.\n\nOption (a) is a single event: \"Tom would apologize for the misunderstanding and offer to exchange the gift.\"\n\nOption (b) is a conjunction of two events: \"Tom would apologize for the misunderstanding and offer to exchange the gift\" and \"the new gift would be something related to the Alabama Crimson Tide football team.\"\n\nAccording to the rules of probability, the likelihood of a single event (option a) is always greater than or equal to the likelihood of a conjunction of events (option b). This is because the second event in option (b) is dependent on the first event happening, and any dependency reduces the overall probability.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer, avoiding the conjunction fallacy, is (a) Tom would apologize for the misunderstanding and offer to exchange the gift.",
