People with high functioning autism, like Eric, often have specific methods to cope with intense emotions, and seeking a quiet, isolated place is a common strategy.\n\nOption (b) states that \"Eric might seek a quiet, isolated place to calm down to watch the sunset.\" While it's possible that Eric might enjoy watching the sunset, this option adds an extra detail that isn't suggested by the information given about Eric. The question is about how Eric handles his anger, not about his potential enjoyment of sunsets.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, option (a) is more likely than option (b).",

The crowd reacts by pointing, laughing, and cheering.\n\nOption (a) suggests that the candidate would likely continue with the speech while acknowledging the bird's presence. This option is more likely because it directly addresses the unexpected event that has just occurred. By acknowledging the bird, the candidate can maintain the audience's attention and engagement, and potentially use the situation to their advantage by making a lighthearted comment or tying it into their message.\n\nOption (b) suggests that the candidate would likely continue with the speech while acknowledging the bird's presence to discuss upcoming policy changes. This option is less likely because it does not directly address the unexpected event that has just occurred. Instead, it assumes that the candidate would use the interruption as an opportunity to discuss policy changes, which may not be relevant or appropriate in the given context.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) The protagonist would likely continue with the speech while acknowledging the bird's presence.",
