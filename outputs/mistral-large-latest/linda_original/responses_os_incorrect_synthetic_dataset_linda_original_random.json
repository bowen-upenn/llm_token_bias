The information does not specifically mention farming, ranching, or agricultural management, but it also doesn't contradict these possibilities. As for birdwatching, it's not mentioned either, so we can't make a definitive conclusion.\n\nHowever, since you've asked me to choose between the two options, I would say (a) \"Morgan is a farmer, rancher, or other agricultural manager\" is more probable. This is because the second part of option (b), \"enjoys birdwatching in a local park,\" is an additional assumption that isn't suggested by the information given. It's important to note that this is a probability based on the information provided, and it's entirely possible that Morgan's actual life could differ from this.",
