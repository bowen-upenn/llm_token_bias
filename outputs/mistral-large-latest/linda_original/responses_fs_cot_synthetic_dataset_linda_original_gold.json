The probability of her being a control and valve installer and repairer is not zero, as people can have different careers than their degrees, but it is less likely.\n\nHowever, option (b) adds an additional condition that Leilani participates in coral reef restoration projects. Even though we know Leilani is passionate about ocean conservation and participates in such projects, adding this condition makes the scenario less probable. This is because the probability of two independent events happening together is always less than the probability of each event happening individually.\n\nTherefore, based on the principles of probability, the more probable option is (a) Leilani is a control and valve installer and repairer, except mechanical door.",
