The information given about Neha Patel describes her as a data scientist with specific interests and hobbies, but it does not mention anything about her being a taper (a person who records performances) or participating in geocaching. Therefore, the probability of Neha being a taper is higher than the probability of her being a taper who also enjoys geocaching, as the second option adds an additional condition that is not suggested by the provided information.
