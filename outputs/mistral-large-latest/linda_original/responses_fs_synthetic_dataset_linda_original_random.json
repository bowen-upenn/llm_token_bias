        "question": "Leilani is a 48-year-old Pacific Islander from Hawaii. She holds degrees in marine biology and environmental science from the University of Hawaii. Passionate about ocean conservation, Leilani has dedicated her career to protecting marine ecosystems. She is known for her resilient and compassionate nature, often volunteering for beach clean-ups and community education programs. An avid scuba diver and hiker, Leilani spends most of her free time exploring the natural beauty of her island home. She also enjoys sharing her love for Hawaiian culture and traditions through local workshops and festivals.\n\nWhich is more probable?\n(a) Leilani is a control and valve installer and repairer, except mechanical door, and paints watercolor landscapes.\n(b) Leilani is a control and valve installer and repairer, except mechanical door.",

        "retry": false,
        "use_multi_agents": false,
        "init_model_answer": "Based on the information provided about Leilani's background, education, and interests, option (a) and (b) both seem less probable. However, if we have to choose between the two, option (b) \"Leilani is a control and valve installer and repairer, except mechanical door\" would be less probable. This is because her education and passion are more aligned with marine biology and environmental science, not mechanical work. Option (a) is even less probable as it adds an unrelated activity (painting watercolor landscapes) to the less likely occupation.",
