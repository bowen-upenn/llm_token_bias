Let's consider this:\n\n(a) Space shuttle Endeavour is scheduled to launch on April 19 for its final flight. This option is more likely because it only mentions the scheduled launch date, which aligns with the fact that the storm caused minor damage to Endeavour, implying it is still on Earth.\n\n(b) Space shuttle Endeavour is scheduled to launch on April 19 for its final flight so that it can dock with the International Space Station for a supply mission. This option is less likely because it implies that Endeavour is already in space and ready to dock with the ISS, which contradicts the information about the storm damaging Endeavour on Earth.\n\nSo, based on the given information, option (a) is more likely.",
