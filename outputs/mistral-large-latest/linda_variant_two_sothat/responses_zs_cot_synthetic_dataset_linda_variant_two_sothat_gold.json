However, it doesn't provide a clear reason or mechanism for how this would happen.\n\n(b) \"But possibility our rudeness may be disseminated, may keep us in line so that we ultimately display more courtesy in public spaces.\"\nThis option also suggests that the widespread sharing of rude behavior might lead to better behavior, but it adds a qualifier: that this might happen \"so that we ultimately display more courtesy in public spaces.\" This suggests a potential mechanism: seeing the negative consequences of rude behavior might encourage people to act more courteously.\n\nGiven these options, (b) seems more likely. It provides a clearer explanation for how widespread rudeness could lead to improved behavior, whereas (a) does not. However, it's important to note that this is a complex issue with many factors at play, and the actual outcome could depend on a variety of individual and societal factors.",
