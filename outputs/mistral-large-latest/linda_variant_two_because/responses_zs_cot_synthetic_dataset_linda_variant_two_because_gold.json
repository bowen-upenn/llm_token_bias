Both (a) and (b) discuss a \"big response\" from other owners, but (b) provides a reason for this response - that they are impressed with the proactive steps taken to prevent the spread of flu. Given the context of the Thai-themed restaurant implementing anti H1N1 flu measures, it's reasonable to assume that the response from other owners would be due to these measures. Therefore, option (b) is more likely.",
