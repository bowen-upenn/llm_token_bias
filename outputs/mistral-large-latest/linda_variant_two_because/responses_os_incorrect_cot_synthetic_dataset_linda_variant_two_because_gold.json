This is a possibility as any aid sent to Gaza could potentially be used by Hamas, the governing authority in Gaza, to strengthen its position.\n\n(b) Israeli officials say they fear any aid would bolster Hamas because it would violate existing sanctions against the terrorist organization. This is also a possibility, but it would depend on the specifics of the existing sanctions. If the sanctions prohibit any form of aid, then this scenario is likely. However, if the sanctions allow for certain types of aid (like humanitarian aid), then this scenario is less likely.\n\nIn conclusion, both scenarios (a) and (b) are possible, but their likelihood would depend on the specific circumstances, including the nature of the aid and the terms of the existing sanctions.",
