The statement then concludes that a subset of rubbers inherently possess elastic properties. This conclusion is logically sound because if rubbers are a type of material and some materials have elastic properties, it follows that some rubbers (a subset) would also have elastic properties.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that this conclusion is only true if there are rubbers that fall into the subset of materials that exhibit elasticity.
