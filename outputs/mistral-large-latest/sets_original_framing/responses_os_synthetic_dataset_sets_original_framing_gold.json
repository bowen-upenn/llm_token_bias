The argument incorrectly assumes that if butters belong to the category of dairy products and some dairy products are high in calcium, then some butters must be high in calcium. However, butter is an exception among dairy products because it is primarily composed of fat and contains little to no calcium. Therefore, it is not accurate to conclude that a subset of butters are high in calcium based on the given premises.",
