However, we can make an educated guess based on probabilities.\n\nWhen an album is first released, its initial success is often determined by the hype surrounding the release, the artist's fanbase, and the marketing efforts put into promoting the album. If the album does not chart in its first week, it could be due to a lack of promotion, competition with other major releases, or a smaller fanbase.\n\nHowever, an album's success is not solely determined by its first-week performance. Many albums have gone on to achieve great success after a slow start. This could be due to a variety of factors, such as word-of-mouth promotion, successful singles, or a growing appreciation for the album over time.\n\nGiven these considerations, option (b) \"The album does not chart on its first week but eventually goes platinum\" is not impossible, but it is less likely than option (a) \"The album does not chart on its first week.\" Therefore, the more likely answer is (a).",

Winning multiple Grammy awards typically requires a high level of acclaim across the industry.\n\nGiven these considerations, the more likely scenario is (a) The album receives mixed reviews.",
