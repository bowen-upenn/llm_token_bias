Conversely, if a world tour sells out all major venues, it implies a high level of popularity and demand, which would likely translate into album sales and charting. Therefore, it's more likely that either (a) the album won't chart and the tour doesn't sell out, or (c) the album does chart and the tour sells out.

Furthermore, the competition is extremely high, as many books are released each year. Therefore, it's more likely that a book, even if it sells well, may not make it onto the list.

On the other hand, a single's success can be more immediate and relies heavily on the appeal of that one track. It's possible for an artist to have a hit single but not a top-charting album.
