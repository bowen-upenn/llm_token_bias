The question asks which event is more likely, not which event is certain to happen.\n2. In a tennis tournament like Wimbledon, it's extremely rare for a player to win the entire tournament without losing a single set. Even the best players often lose a set or two along the way.\n3.

This is because China's economic system is characterized by a mix of free-market principles and strong state control, particularly in key industries. It is more likely that David would advise on a system that aligns with the existing economic structure of China.",

Sirica that would suggest he is more likely to compromise his legal principles than to uphold them, we cannot make a definitive judgment. However, based on the concept of probability, option (a) \"He compromises his legal principles\" is more likely than option (b) \"He compromises his legal principles but ultimately upholds the integrity of the legal process.\"\n\nThis is because option (b) includes two separate events: compromising legal principles and then upholding the integrity of the legal process. The probability of two independent events both occurring is always lower than the probability of just one of those events occurring. Therefore, it is more likely that James J. Sirica would compromise his legal principles (if he were to do so) than that he would both compromise his principles and then uphold the integrity of the legal process.",
