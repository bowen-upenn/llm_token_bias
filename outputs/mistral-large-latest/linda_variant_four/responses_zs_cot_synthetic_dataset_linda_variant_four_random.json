FDR was a pivotal figure in American history, serving as President during some of the nation's most challenging times, including the Great Depression and World War II.\n\nAlthough it is difficult to predict the actions of a historical figure in a hypothetical situation, it is more likely that FDR's sudden resurrection would generate immense public interest and curiosity, even if he chose not to give a speech on modern American politics. People would be eager to learn from his experiences, understand his perspectives on historical events, and hear his thoughts on contemporary issues.\n\nThe resurrection of FDR, even for a day, would provide a unique opportunity for the public to engage with history in a more personal and tangible way.

An album receiving critically poor reviews is a standalone event that depends on the quality of the music, production, and other factors related to the album itself. On the other hand, an album receiving poor reviews but still topping the Billboard charts is less likely because it involves two separate events occurring simultaneously: the album being critically panned and still managing to outsell all other albums.

This includes the emergence of new nations, shifts in global power dynamics, technological advancements, and changes in international law and diplomacy. Therefore, option (a) \"He struggles to understand contemporary geopolitics\" seems plausible.\n\nHowever, Marshall was known for his diplomatic skills and his ability to navigate complex political landscapes, which could potentially help him adapt to modern times. Therefore, it's not entirely implausible that, after a period of adjustment and learning, he could contribute significantly to international policy. This aligns with option (b) \"He struggles to understand contemporary geopolitics but eventually brokers a groundbreaking international agreement.\"\n\nIn conclusion, while both options have some degree of likelihood, option (b) seems to be a more comprehensive scenario, considering Marshall's known abilities and the complexity of modern geopolitics.",
