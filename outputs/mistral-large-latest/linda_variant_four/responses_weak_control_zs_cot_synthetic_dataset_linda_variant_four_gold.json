In order for (b) to occur, not only would Kamala Harris have to lose in the primary elections, but she would also have to be chosen as the vice-presidential candidate again. This makes option (b) less likely than option (a), as it involves a conjunction of events, hence the term \"conjunction fallacy\". The probability of multiple events happening together is always less than or equal to the probability of any one of those events happening individually.",

This is an example of the conjunction fallacy, where people assume that specific conditions are more probable than general ones. In reality, the probability of two events happening together (in this case, receiving a standing ovation AND removing a shoe and banging it on the table) is always less than or equal to the probability of just one of those events happening alone.",

This fallacy occurs when people assume that specific conditions are more probable than general ones.\n\nIn this case, option (b) is more specific as it includes the condition of maintaining strong state control over key industries in addition to implementing a completely free-market system. However, logically, the probability of two independent events occurring together (as in option (b)) is always less than or equal to the probability of either one occurring alone (as in option (a)).\n\nTherefore, despite any preconceived notions or stereotypes about economic policies, the correct answer based on the principles of probability is (a) He implements a completely free-market system.
