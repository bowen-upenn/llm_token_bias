The Rolling Stones are a highly popular and well-established band with a large fan base.\n2. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that their new album won't chart in any country (option a).\n3. However, the success of a world tour selling out all major venues is not directly related to the album's chart performance. It could happen independently.\n4. But considering their popularity, it's more likely that if their album charts, their tour would also be successful.\n5. So, the scenario where their album doesn't chart but their tour sells out (option b) is less likely than the scenario where their album charts (which contradicts option a).",

Both (a) and (b) include the movie receiving critical backlash and failing at the box office.\n2. However, option (b) includes an additional outcome: Leonardo DiCaprio winning an award for his performance.\n3. For (b) to be more likely than (a), it would mean that the likelihood of Leonardo DiCaprio winning an award for his performance in a critically backlashed and box office failed movie is higher than the movie simply receiving backlash and failing.\n4.

The likelihood of a book becoming a bestseller in the USA and the reaction of Western scholars to it would depend on various factors, such as the content of the book, the marketing efforts behind it, the public's interest in the topic, and the prevailing political climate. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question without more information.",

However, I can still provide an answer based on historical and factual information.\n\nTeng Hsiao-Ping, also known as Deng Xiaoping, was a Chinese politician and reformist leader of the Communist Party of China who served as the paramount leader of the People's Republic of China from 1978 until his retirement in 1992. He is known for his economic reforms, often described as \"Socialism with Chinese characteristics\". This involved opening China to foreign investment, the gradual loosening of state control over agriculture, and the promotion of market forces in the economy, while maintaining the political dominance of the Communist Party.\n\nGiven this historical context, option (b) is more likely: \"He implements a completely free-market system but maintains strong state control over key industries.\" This is more in line with the economic policies associated with Deng Xiaoping. However, it's important to note that this is a hypothetical scenario, as Deng Xiaoping passed away in 1997 and cannot advise on China's economic policies in 2023.",
