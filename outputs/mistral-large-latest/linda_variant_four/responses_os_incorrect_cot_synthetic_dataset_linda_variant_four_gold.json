However, the question asks for the more likely scenario.\n\nGeorge Catlett Marshall was a highly skilled and experienced diplomat and military leader who played a significant role in shaping international policy in the mid-20th century. If he were to return to modern times, it's likely that he would initially struggle to understand contemporary geopolitics due to the many changes that have occurred since his time.\n\nHowever, considering his proven ability to adapt and innovate in complex situations, it's reasonable to assume that he would eventually be able to understand the current geopolitical landscape. Therefore, option (b) \"He struggles to understand contemporary geopolitics but eventually brokers a groundbreaking international agreement\" seems to be more likely.\n\nSo, the answer is (b).",
