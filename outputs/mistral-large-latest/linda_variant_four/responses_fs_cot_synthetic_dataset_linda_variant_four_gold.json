The conjunction \"but\" in option (b) indicates that both conditions must be true for the statement to be correct. However, maintaining strong state control over key industries while implementing a completely free-market system is contradictory, making option (b) less likely.\n\nAdditionally, Teng Hsiao-Ping, also known as Deng Xiaoping, was a Chinese politician who was in power from the 1970s until the early 1990s. He passed away in 1997, so it is impossible for him to be advising on China's economic policies in 2023. However, assuming that the question is referring to a hypothetical scenario where he is still alive and advising on economic policies, option (a) would still be the more likely answer.",

Scenario (a) only requires one event to occur (John J. Sirica compromising his legal principles), while scenario (b) requires two events to occur (John J.
