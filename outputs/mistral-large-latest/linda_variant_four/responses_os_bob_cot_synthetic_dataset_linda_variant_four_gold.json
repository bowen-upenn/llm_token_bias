This seems highly unlikely given their past success and enduring popularity.\n\n(b) The album does not chart anywhere in the world but their tour sells out multiple stadiums globally. This scenario presents a contradiction. If the album fails to chart, it implies a lack of interest or popularity.

These two outcomes seem inconsistent.\n\nGiven the inconsistency in option (b), the more likely scenario, although still highly improbable, would be (a) The album does not chart anywhere in the world.

Nikita Khrushchev, a former leader of the Soviet Union, is famously known for an incident at the United Nations in 1960 where he removed his shoe and banged it on the table in a heated moment during a debate. While the standing ovation is not part of the historical record, it's included in both options, so we can focus on the unique aspect of each option. Therefore, the more likely scenario is (b) He will receive a standing ovation from all present but then dramatically remove his shoe and bang it on the table.",

However, his political philosophy might differ significantly from Western perspectives, which could lead to criticism from Western scholars.",

Teng Hsiao-Ping, also known as Deng Xiaoping, was a leader of the Communist Party of China who is best known for his economic reforms in the late 1970s and 1980s. These reforms introduced free-market principles to China's economy, but the state maintained control over key industries. This model is often referred to as \"socialism with Chinese characteristics.\" Therefore, it is more likely that Teng Hsiao-Ping would advise on a system that combines free-market elements with strong state control over key industries.",

However, historically, John J. Sirica is known for his role as the chief judge in the Watergate trials, where he was recognized for his integrity and commitment to the legal process. Therefore, while it's hypothetically possible that he could compromise his legal principles in another major political trial, it's more in line with his known character that he would uphold the integrity of the legal process.
