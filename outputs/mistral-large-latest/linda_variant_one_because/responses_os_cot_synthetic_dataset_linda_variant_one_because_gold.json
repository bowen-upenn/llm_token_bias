This additional detail makes option (b) more specific and thus less probable than option (a), according to the principle of probability theory that more specific conditions are less likely to occur than less specific ones.\n\nSo, the answer is (a) The protagonist, Harry, would likely find a way to dry his pants quickly or change into a dry pair.
