The man added salt, and it initially improved the taste, indicating that some salt was needed.\n2.

This is a reasonable conclusion based on their strong desire for cookies described.\n\n3) For option (b), it adds some additional context - that the protagonist couldn't resist their cravings and felt unhappy without having cookies at home. \n\n4) Both options suggest the protagonist would try to find other ways to get cookies after their parents stopped buying them.\n\n5) However, option (b) provides more context and rationale for why the protagonist would do this - because of being unable to resist cravings and feelings of unhappiness without cookies.\n\n6) Given the protagonist's clear love and over-indulgence in cookies described, the additional context in (b) about cravings and unhappiness makes it the more likely and complete explanation.\n\nSo in this case, I would say option (b) is more likely the correct answer.

This is directly supported by the passage.\n5) Option (b) adds additional detail - that Paul would play with it because he thought it was funny and enjoyable.\n6) While option (b) is probably true based on the passage, it goes beyond just stating the fact that Paul would play with the crab.\n7) Between the two options, (a) is more likely and directly supported because it simply affirms that Paul would play with his new pet hermit crab without adding any additional assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the more likely answer is (a) Paul would play with his hermit crab.",

It also mentions Ben was extremely happy about this experience to the point of crying.\n\n2) Option (a) states that Ben might frame the autographed shirt to preserve the memory.\n\n3) Option (b) states that Ben might frame the autographed shirt to preserve the memory because it was signed by his favorite wrestler.\n\n4) Both options indicate that Ben might want to frame the autographed shirt to preserve the memory of this special experience.\n\n5) However, option (b) provides additional context by specifying that the reason Ben would want to frame the shirt is because it was autographed by his favorite wrestler specifically.\n\n6) Given how enthusiastic Ben seems to be about wrestling and meeting his favorite wrestler, the additional context in option (b) that ties the framing of the shirt directly to it being autographed by his favorite wrestler makes it more likely and specific.\n\nTherefore, based on the scenario provided, option (b) is more likely - Ben might frame the autographed shirt to preserve the memory because it was signed by his favorite wrestler.",
