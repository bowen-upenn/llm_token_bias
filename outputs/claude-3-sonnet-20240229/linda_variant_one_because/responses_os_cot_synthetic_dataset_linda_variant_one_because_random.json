Let's think through it step-by-step:\n\nStep 1: Understand the background information provided.\n- Jeremy had a troubled childhood and started getting involved in criminal activities from a young age.\n- He has been in and out of juvenile detention centers (Juvie) and is currently in jail at 35 years old, categorized as a career criminal.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the options.\nOption (a): Jeremy would likely commit another crime.\nOption (b): Jeremy would likely commit another crime because he likes to watch action movies.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the options based on the given information.\nOption (a) is based on Jeremy's criminal history and his categorization as a career criminal. This information directly supports the likelihood of him committing another crime in the future.\n\nOption (b) introduces an additional factor, \"because he likes to watch action movies,\" which is not supported by the given information. While watching action movies may influence some individuals, there is no evidence provided to suggest that this is a significant factor in Jeremy's case.\n\nStep 4: Choose the more logical and well-supported option.\nBased on the analysis, option (a) \"Jeremy would likely commit another crime\" is the more logical and well-supported choice. It aligns with the provided background information about Jeremy's criminal history and his current status as a career criminal.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) Jeremy would likely commit another crime.",
