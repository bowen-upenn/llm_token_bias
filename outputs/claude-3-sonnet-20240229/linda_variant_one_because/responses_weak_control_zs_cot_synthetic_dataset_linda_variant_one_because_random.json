Therefore, the correct answer is (a) because it is more likely than the conjunction stated in (b).\n\nTo think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. Identify the general condition: \"Eli might continue playing catch with his dad after recovering.\"\n2. Identify the conjunction: \"Eli might continue playing catch with his dad after recovering\" AND \"because it was a sunny day.\"\n3. The probability of the general condition (a) cannot be lower than the probability of the conjunction (b) because the conjunction includes the general condition plus an additional condition (\"because it was a sunny day\").\n4.

In other words, the probability of option (a) should be greater than or equal to the probability of option (b).\n\nStep 1: Consider option (a)\n\"Yannick would likely visit other iconic landmarks in New York City and send pictures to his friends.\"\nThis statement is consistent with the given information that Yannick visited the Empire State Building and sent pictures to his friends. It is reasonable to assume that he might visit other iconic landmarks and continue sending pictures.\n\nStep 2: Consider option (b)\n\"Yannick would likely visit other iconic landmarks in New York City and send pictures to his friends because he likes to eat croissants for breakfast.\"\nThis statement includes an additional condition \"because he likes to eat croissants for breakfast.\" This condition is irrelevant to the likelihood of visiting other landmarks and sending pictures. It does not provide any additional information that would increase the probability of the first part of the statement.\n\nTherefore, option (a) is more likely than option (b) because it does not include an irrelevant condition, and the probability of a single event (visiting other landmarks and sending pictures) cannot be lower than the probability of the conjunction of that event and an unrelated condition (liking croissants for breakfast).\n\nIn summary, the correct answer is (a) \"Yannick would likely visit other iconic landmarks in New York City and send pictures to his friends.\"",

Understand the question: The question is asking which of the two options is more likely to occur based on the given information about Julie's situation.\n\n2. Analyze option (a): \"Julie might join a club or group that interests her.\" This statement is quite broad and general. It suggests that Julie may join a club or group based on her interests, which is a reasonable and plausible scenario given that she is trying to fit in at her new school.\n\n3. Analyze option (b): \"Julie might join a club or group that interests her because she likes the color of their club logo.\" This statement is more specific and includes an additional condition: Julie liking the color of the club logo. While it is possible for someone to join a club or group based on such a trivial factor as liking the logo color, it is considered a less probable reason compared to joining based on genuine interest.\n\n4. Apply the conjunction rule: The conjunction rule states that the probability of two events occurring together (in this case, Julie joining a club she is interested in AND liking the color of the logo) is always less than or equal to the probability of either one of those events occurring alone (Julie joining a club she is interested in).\n\n5. Identify the more likely option: Based on the conjunction rule and the general plausibility of the statements, option (a) \"Julie might join a club or group that interests her\" is more likely than option (b) \"Julie might join a club or group that interests her because she likes the color of their club logo.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) \"Julie might join a club or group that interests her.\"\n\nThis question illustrates the concept of the conjunction fallacy, which is the tendency to judge a specific condition as more probable than a general condition, even though the specific condition logically cannot be more probable than the general condition.",
