It makes sense that someone who has gained weight and experienced clothing not fitting would consider starting a diet or buying new clothes in a larger size.\n\nOption (b): Ken might start a diet or buy new clothes that fit better because he enjoys watching science fiction movies.\nThis option includes an additional piece of information (Ken enjoying science fiction movies) that is not mentioned or implied in the given scenario. His enjoyment of sci-fi movies does not seem relevant to his decision to start a diet or buy new clothes.\n\nStep-by-step thinking:\n1. The given information focuses on Ken's weight gain and the incident with his jeans tearing.\n2. Option (a) directly relates to addressing the issue of weight gain by starting a diet or buying new clothes.\n3. Option (b) includes an additional detail about sci-fi movies that is not connected to the given information.\n4. Since option (a) is more logically connected and relevant to the given scenario, it is the more likely option.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) Ken might start a diet or buy new clothes that fit better.",

This is relevant to the situation described and a reasonable expectation if she wants to get better from her illness.\n\n3) Option (b) adds an additional detail that Cora enjoys listening to jazz music. This detail is not relevant to whether she would take her prescribed antibiotics or not.\n\n4) When evaluating which option is more likely, we should choose the one that directly relates to the situation described, without introducing irrelevant additional information.\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is (a) Cora would take her antibiotics as prescribed. The fact that she enjoys jazz music in option (b) does not increase or decrease the likelihood that she would follow the doctor's prescription for her antibiotics.",

This seems very likely given that you joined the club and were happily accepted by the existing members.\n\n4) Option (b) adds an extra detail that doesn't seem connected to the rest of the story - that the protagonist would participate because they enjoy eating Italian food. There is no mention of Italian food or any reasoning provided for why the protagonist would participate.\n\nSo based on the information given in the story, option (a) appears to be more likely and relevant.

Their commander gives them orders to stand at attention, then at ease, and then to break/take a rest.\n\nOption (a) simply states that the protagonist (assuming he is one of the men in this group) would likely join the others in taking the rest that was ordered by the commander. This follows logically from the details provided in the passage.\n\nOption (b) adds an additional detail about the protagonist preferring coffee over tea. However, this preference for coffee is not relevant to the situation described of soldiers following their commander's orders.\n\nSince option (a) directly follows from the information given in the passage, while option (b) introduces an irrelevant detail, the more likely answer is (a) - that the protagonist would likely join the other men in taking the well-needed rest that was ordered.\n\nSo in summary, by analyzing the passage and options step-by-step, option (a) is the more logical and likely choice based on the information provided.",
