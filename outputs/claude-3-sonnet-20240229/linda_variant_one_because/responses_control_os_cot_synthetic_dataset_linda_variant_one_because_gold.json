The key is to recognize that we are dealing with two events:\n\nEvent A: Ken starts a diet or buys new clothes that fit better.\nEvent B: Ken felt embarrassed when his jeans tore in public.\n\nNow, we need to compare the probabilities of the following two options:\n\n(a) The probability of Event A occurring alone: P(A)\n(b) The probability of the conjunction of Event A and Event B occurring together: P(A and B)\n\nAccording to the basic rules of probability theory, the probability of a conjunction (two events occurring together) is always less than or equal to the probability of either individual event. In other words:\n\nP(A and B) \u2264 P(A)\nP(A and B) \u2264 P(B)\n\nTherefore, option (a) Ken starts a diet or buys new clothes that fit better is more likely than option (b) Ken starts a diet or buys new clothes that fit better because he felt embarrassed when his jeans tore in public.\n\nThe narrative details about Ken's weight gain, wearing old jeans, and them tearing in public are irrelevant to the probabilistic reasoning required to solve this problem correctly. We should ignore these details and focus solely on the probabilities involved.",
