Analyze option (b):\n\"The protagonist would likely contact their professor to explain the situation and request a makeup exam because they are worried that failing to take the exam could significantly affect their grade.\"\nThis option adds an additional detail: the protagonist's motivation for contacting the professor and requesting a makeup exam is their worry that failing to take the exam could significantly affect their grade.\n\n4. Compare the options:\nOption (b) is more specific than option (a) because it includes the additional detail about the protagonist's motivation or concern. Option (a) is a more general statement that does not specify the protagonist's motivation.\n\n5. Determine the more likely option:\nIn this scenario, it is reasonable to assume that the protagonist would be concerned about failing to take the exam and how it could affect their grade. Therefore, option (b) is more likely because it includes this plausible motivation, making it a more complete and specific statement than option (a).\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the more likely option is (b) The protagonist would likely contact their professor to explain the situation and request a makeup exam because they are worried that failing to take the exam could significantly affect their grade.",

Analyze option (a):\n   \"Mike would likely reapply to Harvard after his travels.\"\n   - This option suggests that Mike still desires to attend Harvard after his year off.\n   - It doesn't provide any additional information or reasoning.\n\n3.

So the key difference is whether we think the reason she practices regularly is specifically because of a fear of making mistakes during performances.\n\n3) The background information tells us that Courtney has dreamed of being a cheerleader her whole life and worked hard towards that goal by taking gymnastics lessons.

The question is asking about the probability or likelihood of two events happening.\n\n2. Option (a) states that Francis would apologize to his grandparents, without providing any additional context or reasoning.\n\n3. Option (b) states that Francis would apologize to his grandparents and provides two reasons: (i) he felt guilty, and (ii) he wanted to restore the good relationship.\n\n4. Since option (b) includes the event described in option (a) (Francis apologizing) and adds more specific details about his motivations, it is considered a more specific and narrower scenario than option (a).\n\n5. According to the principle of probability, a more general or broader event is always more likely to occur than a more specific or narrower event, assuming all other factors are equal.\n\nBased on this analysis, the more likely option is (a) Francis would apologize to his grandparents, as it is a broader and more general statement than option (b), which includes additional specific details about Francis's motivations.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that in real-life situations, personal motivations and relationships can play a significant role in determining an individual's actions. Therefore, while option (a) is more likely from a purely probabilistic standpoint, option (b) may better reflect Francis's actual thought process and reasons for apologizing, given the context provided.",

While carrying the plate of hot dogs, she tripped and dropped them, causing them to get covered in dirt and become inedible. As a result, everyone had to eat less food since the hot dogs were ruined.\n\nStep 2: Analyze option (a)\n(a) Abigail would apologize to her friends for dropping the hot dogs.\n\nThis option suggests that Abigail would simply apologize for dropping the hot dogs, which is a common courtesy when an accident occurs. It acknowledges her mistake but does not provide any further explanation or context.\n\nStep 3: Analyze option (b)\n(b) Abigail would apologize to her friends for dropping the hot dogs because she felt responsible for everyone having less to eat.\n\nThis option not only includes an apology for dropping the hot dogs but also provides a reason or explanation for the apology. Specifically, it suggests that Abigail felt responsible for the consequence of her action, which was that everyone had to eat less food due to the ruined hot dogs.\n\nStep 4: Compare the options\nOption (b) is more specific and includes additional context and reasoning for Abigail's apology. It acknowledges not only her mistake but also the impact it had on others. This level of awareness and responsibility makes option (b) more likely or probable compared to the simple apology in option (a).\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and logical analysis, the more likely option is:\n\n(b) Abigail would apologize to her friends for dropping the hot dogs because she felt responsible for everyone having less to eat.",

This is the given information.\n\n2) Option (a) states: \"Tom would arrange to pick up the furniture he purchased on Craigslist.\" This is a straightforward and logical consequence of purchasing furniture online - he would need to arrange to pick it up.\n\n3) Option (b) adds an additional condition: \"because he was eager to use it to furnish his new apartment.\" This extra detail about furnishing a new apartment is not stated or implied in the original information given.\n\n4) In evaluating probabilities, the option with fewer additional assumptions or conditions is generally more likely than the one with extra assumptions tacked on.\n\n5) Therefore, following the principle of making the fewest assumptions beyond the given information, option (a) is more likely than option (b).\n\nSo the correct answer is (a) Tom would arrange to pick up the furniture he purchased on Craigslist.",
