After seeking help from a therapist and engaging in therapy sessions, they were able to \"fix\" their overthinking issue and now usually do not overthink anymore. The passage also mentions that part of this process involved \"much talking\" with the therapist.\n\nTherefore, it is reasonable to assume that through therapy, the protagonist not only overcame their overthinking tendencies but also learned effective communication strategies for openly discussing their thoughts and feelings with others without getting caught up in overthinking. Option (b) explicitly states this connection between the therapy, overcoming overthinking, and learning effective communication strategies, making it the more likely and specific choice given the information provided.",

By getting the tattoo changed to an eagle, the protagonist is trying to move on and cover up the reminder of that painful past relationship. So it makes sense that if he were to show off the new eagle tattoo, it would be motivated by a desire to embrace the change and leave behind the painful memory, rather than just randomly showing it off without that context.",

It's a situation that needs to be addressed promptly.\n\nOption (a) simply states that Billy would return to the gas station, but it doesn't provide a specific reason or motivation for his actions.\n\nOption (b) adds more context and a plausible explanation for why Billy would return. It suggests that he realized the potential consequences of his mistake and wanted to take responsibility by resolving the issue before leaving.\n\nMost people, when faced with a situation where they may have caused damage or inconvenience to others due to their own mistake, would likely feel compelled to address the problem and make amends, if possible. This sense of responsibility and willingness to rectify the situation makes option (b) more probable than the simpler statement in option (a).",
