The embarrassment from the public ripping of his too-tight jeans makes it more likely that he would take steps to avoid a similar situation in the future by losing weight or getting new clothes.\n\nOption (a) is also possible, but lacks the additional context and motivation provided by the embarrassing incident described.",

Joining a club or group that aligns with her interests would be a logical way for her to meet like-minded people and potentially make new friends, which seems to be her motivation based on the context provided. Therefore, option (b) which includes her desire to make more friends as the reason for joining a club/group is more likely than option (a) which doesn't specify the motivation.",

The phrasing \"The men took a well needed rest\" suggests they were likely tired or exhausted from some prior activities.\n\nOption (b) expands on this by providing additional context that the protagonist (one of the men) was feeling very exhausted after a long week of intense physical training, which would make it more likely he would join the other men in taking that much-needed rest.\n\nOption (a) is a bit more vague and doesn't provide that added context about the protagonist's specific state of exhaustion from prior training.\n\nSo by including those extra details about the protagonist's tiredness from physical training, option (b) becomes the more likely and plausible scenario given the military context depicted in the passage.",
