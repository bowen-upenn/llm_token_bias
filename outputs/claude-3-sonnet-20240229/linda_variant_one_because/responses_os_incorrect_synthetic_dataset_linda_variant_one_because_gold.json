The story mentions that when the protagonist and their friends first joined, they felt \"difficult and out of place\" while watching the ongoing act.\n\n2. However, after the act finished, the existing members \"greeted us with smiles\" and took the new members into the group.\n\n3. The story ends by saying \"we were so happy\", implying that the warm welcome and acceptance from the existing members made the protagonist and friends feel happy and comfortable to participate.\n\nSo the welcoming attitude of the current theater club members seems to be the primary motivating factor for the protagonist continuing their participation in the club's activities and rehearsals. Option (b) captures this nuance better than just saying they would participate without giving the reason.",

This suggests they have been through some kind of rigorous physical activity or training. The detail that they took a \"well needed rest\" implies they were likely exhausted and needed time to recover. While option (a) is plausible, option (b) provides additional context that fits the situation more completely by specifying the protagonist was exhausted after a long week of intense physical training.",

Since he purchased used furniture on Craigslist at affordable prices, it's reasonable to infer that he needed to furnish a new living space like an apartment. The additional detail about him being eager to use the furniture for this purpose makes option (b) more likely than simply stating he would pick up the furniture, with no further explanation.",
