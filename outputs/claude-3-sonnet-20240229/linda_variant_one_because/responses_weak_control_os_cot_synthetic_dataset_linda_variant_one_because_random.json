The scenario tells us that Jenny's dog was hungry, and she had to feed it leftover white rice because she ran out of dog food.\n2. Option (a) states that Jenny would buy more dog food, which is a logical consequence of running out of dog food.\n3. Option (b) adds an additional condition, \"it was raining outside,\" to the scenario of buying more dog food.\n\nAccording to the principles of probability, a single event (buying more dog food) is always more probable than the conjunction of that event and an additional condition (buying more dog food and it was raining outside).\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is (a) Jenny would buy more dog food.\n\nAdding the condition \"it was raining outside\" in option (b) makes the scenario more specific and less probable than the general scenario in option (a).",
