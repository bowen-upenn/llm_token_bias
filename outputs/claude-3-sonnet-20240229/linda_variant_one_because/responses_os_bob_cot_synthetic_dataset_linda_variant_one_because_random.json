This makes logical sense because if he really wants to get that particular gift for his wife, he would try to find it elsewhere after the first store was sold out.\n\n3) Option (b) adds an additional detail that it was a sunny day. While the weather being sunny is a neutral fact, it doesn't really affect Ken's motivation to find the gift elsewhere after the first store was sold out.\n\n4) Since we want to choose the more likely option, option (a) is more plausible because it directly follows from the key information that Ken wanted to get that specific gift and would logically look elsewhere when the first store didn't have it in stock.\n\n5) The sunny day detail in option (b) is irrelevant and doesn't add any meaningful context to make that option more likely than (a).\n\nTherefore, based on the step-by-step analysis, the more likely option is (a) Ken searches for the gift at another store or online.",

When starting at a new school and having difficulty making friends, joining a club or group that matches one's interests is a common way to meet like-minded people and socialize. It helps in fitting in and making new friends.\n\nOption (b): Julie might join a club or group that interests her because she likes the color of their club logo.\nThis option seems less likely based on the given context. While the color of a club logo might be a minor factor, the primary motivation for joining a club or group would typically be the shared interests or activities, not just the aesthetics of the logo.\n\nTherefore, after considering the context and motivations, option (a) \"Julie might join a club or group that interests her\" is more likely and plausible than option (b).",
