The passage describes a sequence of events where the commander gives instructions to a group of men, first telling them to stand at attention, then to be at ease, and finally to \"break\" and take a rest. It does not provide any information about the protagonist's preferences for coffee or tea, so option (b) is not supported by the given context.",

The transactions all went smoothly.\nWhich is more likely?\n(a) Tom would arrange to pick up the furniture he purchased on Craigslist.\n(b) Tom would arrange to pick up the furniture he purchased on Craigslist because he enjoys listening to jazz music.",

        "init_model_answer": "(a) Tom would arrange to pick up the furniture he purchased on Craigslist.\n\nThe additional detail about Tom enjoying listening to jazz music is irrelevant to the scenario described, which is about him buying used furniture on Craigslist at affordable prices. The more logical and likely conclusion is that he would need to arrange to pick up the furniture he purchased, as that is a natural consequence of the transaction. The information provided does not suggest any connection between his furniture purchase and his music preferences.",
