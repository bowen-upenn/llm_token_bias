Ginette told her husband he wasn't affectionate enough, indicating she wanted more affection from him.\n2. When her husband pet her on the head as a gesture of affection, Ginette \"took it as a sign of progress.\"\n3. This implies that Ginette saw the pet on the head as a positive step, even if small, towards her husband being more affectionate.\n4. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that Ginette would encourage her husband to continue with small affectionate gestures like this, seeing it as a starting point for further improvement in his displays of affection.\n\nOption (a) is too vague and doesn't capture the nuance that Ginette viewed the pet on the head as a good beginning that she hoped would lead to more affectionate behavior from her husband over time.",

To our surprise, they took us into the group and we were so happy.\nWhich is more likely?\n(a) The protagonist would participate in the theater club activities and rehearsals.\n(b) The protagonist would participate in the theater club activities and rehearsals because they felt welcomed and accepted by the existing members.",

This feeling of being welcomed and accepted increases the likelihood that the protagonist would then participate actively in the theater club activities and rehearsals moving forward.",

It does not provide any additional context or details about the protagonist's specific circumstances or reasons for needing the rest. Therefore, the most logical conclusion from the given information is simply that the protagonist, being one of the men described, would likely join the others in taking the rest as instructed by the commander. Option (b) introduces additional details about intense physical training and exhaustion that are not supported by the passage.",

However, there is no specific mention of Tom furnishing a new apartment or his eagerness to use the furniture for that purpose. The statement in option (b) about furnishing a new apartment is an additional detail not provided in the initial information.\n\nTherefore, the safer and more likely choice is option (a), which aligns with the facts provided about Tom purchasing furniture on Craigslist and arranging to pick them up, without making any unsupported assumptions about his motivations or circumstances.",
