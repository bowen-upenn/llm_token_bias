According to the principle of the conjunction fallacy, the probability of a conjunction of two events (option b) cannot be greater than the probability of either event occurring individually (option a).\n\n3. For Francis to apologize because he felt guilty and wanted to restore the good relationship (option b), he must first apologize (option a). Therefore, the probability of option (a) occurring is necessarily greater than or equal to the probability of option (b).\n\n4. Unless we have specific information suggesting that Francis's motivations make option (b) more probable than option (a), which is not the case in the given scenario, we should conclude that option (a) is more likely.\n\nIn summary, while both options involve Francis apologizing to his grandparents, option (a) is a more general and inclusive scenario, making it more probable than the more specific and narrower option (b), according to the principles of probability and the conjunction fallacy.",

Identify the general condition: Option (a) states \"Ginette would likely encourage her husband to continue showing affection in small ways.\" This is a general statement about Ginette's likely reaction.\n\n2.
