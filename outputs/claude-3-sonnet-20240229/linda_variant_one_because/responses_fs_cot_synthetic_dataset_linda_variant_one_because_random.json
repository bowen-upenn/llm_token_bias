Sam made the team initially, but Alexis didn't. However, Sam helped Alexis prepare, and the following year, they both made the team.\n\nTo determine which option is more likely, we need to evaluate the additional information provided in each option.\n\nOption (a): \"The protagonist, Sam, would celebrate with Alexis after they both made the soccer team.\"\nThis option simply states that Sam would celebrate with Alexis after their shared success of making the team. This is a logical and reasonable consequence of the scenario described, and it does not introduce any additional unlikely or unsupported information.\n\nOption (b): \"The protagonist, Sam, would celebrate with Alexis after they both made the soccer team because they planned to get new soccer shoes next week.\"\nThis option adds an extra detail about them planning to get new soccer shoes next week, which is not mentioned or implied in the original scenario. While it's possible that this could be the case, introducing this additional detail makes the option more specific and less likely compared to the more general option (a).\n\nBased on this analysis, option (a) \"The protagonist, Sam, would celebrate with Alexis after they both made the soccer team\" is more likely because it directly follows from the given information without introducing any unsupported additional details.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a).",

However, the purchase of a new desk lamp does not necessarily imply that Tim will study more diligently. It is a peripheral detail that does not directly impact his motivation or ability to study harder.\n\nBased on the premise that Tim missed the original test due to falling asleep while studying, the more logical and direct conclusion is that he might study more diligently for the rescheduled test, as stated in option (a). The additional detail about the new desk lamp in option (b) does not significantly strengthen or weaken the likelihood of Tim studying more diligently.\n\nTherefore, the more probable option is (a) \"Tim might study more diligently for the rescheduled test.\"",

Her learning to make an omelette has no bearing on whether she'd want to photograph or draw the lunar eclipse.\n\nSo based on the information provided, option (a) is more likely and relevant. The fact that Anna had such an emotionally moving experience viewing the eclipse makes it quite probable that she'd want to document it through photos or drawings, regardless of her omelette-making abilities.",

This is a reasonable conclusion based on the information given - having clothes tear due to weight gain could motivate someone to lose weight or get new, properly fitting clothes.\n\n3) Option (b) adds an extra detail \"because he enjoys watching science fiction movies.\" This additional detail about Ken's movie preferences is not relevant to the situation described and does not provide any logical reason for why he would start a diet or buy new clothes.\n\n4) When evaluating which of two options is more probable, we should choose the one that follows more directly from the given information without introducing irrelevant extra details.\n\nTherefore, the more likely answer is (a) Ken might start a diet or buy new clothes that fit better, since this option logically flows from the situation described without adding any extraneous details.",

Since Julie was having trouble fitting in socially, joining a club or group based on her genuine interests would be a logical way for her to find a social circle and \"fit in\" better.\n\n5) Option (b) seems less plausible, as choosing a club solely based on liking the color of their logo, with no mention of actual interests, doesn't align with the background given about Julie's struggle to fit in and find friends.\n\nSo based on the context, the more likely answer is (a) Julie might join a club or group that interests her. Choosing an activity aligning with her interests would help her socially integrate better than just picking randomly based on a logo color.",
