However, option (b) provides an additional reason or motivation for continuing to walk - to further secure or reinforce the repair by stressing it.\n\n5) Without any other context, the simpler explanation of just continuing her walk (option a) seems more likely than the more specific motivation provided in option (b).\n\nSo based on the step-by-step analysis, I would say that option (a) \"Tracy would continue walking on the beach\" is more likely than option (b).",
