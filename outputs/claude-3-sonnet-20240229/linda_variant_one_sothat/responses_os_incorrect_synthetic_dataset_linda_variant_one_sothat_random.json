There is no mention of saving money on electricity bills as a motivation. The more natural inference is that the protagonist would continue to assist and support his wife's newfound passion for grilling out of encouragement and shared enjoyment of the delicious grilled meals she is now able to make.",

In this context, it is more reasonable for the protagonist to reflect on her journey of overcoming her initial denial and finding love, rather than becoming an expert at solving complex mathematical equations, which is not mentioned or implied in the story.\n\nOption (a) is a natural and logical conclusion to the narrative presented, while option (b) introduces an unrelated element about mathematical equations that does not align with the provided information.",

There is no mention or implication that Nathan would want to launch the rocket specifically to make it rain the next day. Children often enjoy launching toy rockets or similar objects just for fun and the thrill of it, without any additional motive like trying to influence the weather. Option (b) introduces an unrealistic and unsupported condition about making it rain. Therefore, (a) is the more logical and probable choice given the context.",
