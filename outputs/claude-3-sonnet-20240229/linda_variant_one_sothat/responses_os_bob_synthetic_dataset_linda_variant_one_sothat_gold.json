This implies that the protagonist's support and assistance helped build her confidence in grilling, leading her to enjoy and expand her grilling skills. Therefore, option (b) which mentions the protagonist continuing to assist and support her to feel more confident and enjoy grilling various dishes is the more logical conclusion from the given information.",

Her journey to finding love with this person, despite her initial denial, could lead her to appreciate the importance of not making final judgments too hastily.",

After the first launch where the rocket landed on the roof, Nathan would likely be excited to launch it again to continue playing with and enjoying his new birthday present.\n\nHowever, option (b) suggests that Nathan would intentionally try to make the rocket land on the roof again, which is an unlikely desired outcome as it would require his mother to climb up and retrieve it each time. Most children would aim to launch the rocket in a way that avoids it getting stuck on the roof.\n\nTherefore, the more reasonable assumption is that Nathan would simply want to launch the rocket again for fun, without necessarily aiming for it to land on the roof a second time. Option (a) is the more likely scenario.",

This implies she wanted to know the gender.\n\n2) It states that \"She was happy with the response.\" This suggests she was pleased to learn the baby's gender, likely so she could prepare accordingly.\n\n3) Decorating the nursery based on the baby's gender is a common reason for expecting parents to want to know the sex ahead of time.\n\nWhile option (a) is also possible and Kim would likely prepare in general for the baby's arrival, the additional context about her agreeing to find out the gender and being happy with the response points to her specific intention of preparing the nursery decor based on whether it's a boy or girl.",
