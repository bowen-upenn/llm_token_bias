Option (b) adds an additional condition \"so that they might consider reducing her grounding period\" which makes the scenario more specific and less probable than just apologizing without that extra condition stated.",

There is no explicit mention of them discussing the party further during the movie outing. So the more reasonable inference is that Georgia accepted Ralph's invitation simply to go to the movie as a gesture of thanks, without any additional context about discussing the party provided.",
