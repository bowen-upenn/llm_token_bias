The passage focuses solely on the lawyers' efforts to appeal and delay the death sentence through existing legal channels.\n\nTherefore, based on the context provided, (a) is the more likely scenario as it aligns with the lawyers' stated goal of pursuing further appeals without making assumptions about new evidence for a retrial.",
