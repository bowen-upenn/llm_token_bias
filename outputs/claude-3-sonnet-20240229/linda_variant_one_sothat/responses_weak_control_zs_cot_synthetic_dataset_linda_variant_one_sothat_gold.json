Option (a) is a general event: Jamillah applying for a job at the law firm.\n2. Option (b) is a more specific event that includes additional conditions: Jamillah applying for a job at the law firm and taking care of her mom while working in her dream career.\n3. According to the rules of probability, a more specific event (option b) cannot be more probable than a general event (option a) that includes it.\n4.

The protagonist has gone through a significant change in their beliefs and values, moving away from the religious beliefs of their family.\n2.

Option (b) adds an additional layer of specificity by suggesting that the discussions would be aimed at fostering mutual understanding despite their differences in beliefs.\n6. Given that the family has already come to terms with the protagonist's change in beliefs, it is more plausible that the protagonist would engage in discussions with the intent of promoting understanding and acceptance, rather than simply discussing their beliefs without a specific purpose.\n\nTherefore, option (b) is more likely because it aligns with the context of the family eventually accepting the protagonist's beliefs and the potential desire for open communication and mutual understanding.\n\nThis example illustrates the conjunction fallacy, where a more specific and detailed statement (option b) is perceived as more likely than a general statement (option a), even though logically, the general statement should be more probable or at least equally probable.",

Therefore, the correct answer should be:\n\n(a) Tommy would continue watching his new favorite shows.\n\nOption (b) is a conjunction (combination) of two events: (1) Tommy continuing to watch his new favorite shows, and (2) Tommy doing so to see how the storylines develop further. Since the second condition adds an additional requirement, the probability of option (b) occurring cannot be greater than the probability of option (a) occurring.\n\nThe conjunction fallacy often leads people to incorrectly judge the more specific option (b) as being more likely than the general option (a), even though this violates the rules of probability.",

Identify the single event in option (a): \"The protagonist would likely reflect on her initial denial of feelings and appreciate her journey to finding love.\"\n2. Identify the combination of events in option (b): \"The protagonist would likely reflect on her initial denial of feelings and appreciate her journey to finding love\" AND \"so that she realizes the importance of giving someone a chance before making a final judgment.\"\n3. Compare the probabilities: A single event (option a) is more probable than a combination of events (option b), unless there is specific information suggesting otherwise.\n4. Since there is no additional information provided, the safer choice is (a), as it represents the more probable single event.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely (a) due to the conjunction fallacy, which suggests that a single event is more probable than a combination of events.",

In this case, option (b) is a more specific condition than option (a) because it includes the additional condition of the rocket landing on the roof again.\n\nAccording to the laws of probability, a conjunction (the combined occurrence of two events) cannot be more probable than either of its constituents. In other words, the probability of option (b) happening cannot be higher than the probability of option (a) happening, since option (b) is a subset of option (a) with an additional condition.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (a) \"Nathan would likely launch the rocket again.\" This option represents a more general event and, therefore, has a higher probability of occurring compared to option (b), which is a more specific event that includes the additional condition of the rocket landing on the roof once more.",
