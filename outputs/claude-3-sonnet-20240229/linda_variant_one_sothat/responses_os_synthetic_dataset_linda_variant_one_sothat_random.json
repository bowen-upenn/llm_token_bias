The scenario paints a serious situation where Tom finds himself unable to enter the United States due to the xenophobic policies and the wall built by the new President. In such circumstances, his priority would likely be trying to find a way to return to the United States itself, rather than being motivated by something as trivial as access to American TV shows.",

This seems less likely, as her parents were described as \"furious\" after catching her sneaking out. In such a situation, it would be riskier and less appropriate for Cara to try bargaining for privileges so soon after her misbehavior.\n\nTherefore, the more probable scenario is (a) that Cara would simply apologize for sneaking out, without attaching any additional conditions or requests.
