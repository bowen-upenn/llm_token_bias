The current Catechism states that modern society has other ways to protect itself from aggressors, so cases where execution is absolutely necessary \"are very rare, if not practically non-existent.\"\n\n3) Pope Francis has spoken out strongly against capital punishment, calling it \"inadmissible\" and an attack on human dignity. He has made appeals for clemency for death row inmates.\n\n4) Pope Francis' broader teachings emphasize mercy, forgiveness, and non-violence as central gospel values.\n\nGiven this context, option (b) seems more likely - that if Pope Alexander were to write an encyclical on capital punishment, he would likely reiterate the Church's opposition to it in most cases, while still affirming the importance of mercy and forgiveness as core Catholic doctrines.\n\nOption (a), stating the encyclical would outright support capital punishment, seems less probable given recent Papal statements and the development of Church teaching away from endorsing executions except perhaps in the rarest, most extreme circumstances.\n\nDoes this analysis make sense?

He's still in his prime years as a boxer at 32 years old.\n\n2) When elite-level boxers like Canelo make a comeback after an extended layoff, they often look rusty and struggle in their first fight back as they shake off ring rust.\n\n3) However, once they get that first fight out of the way, they tend to return to their normal high level quite quickly in subsequent fights.\n\n4) So option (b) - losing the comeback fight but then winning his next three - accounts for the possibility of ring rust in the first fight back, but then his superior skills taking over again quickly after that.\n\n5) Option (a) - just flatly losing the comeback fight - doesn't account for him being able to bounce back and re-establish his elite level after getting that first fight out of the way.\n\nGiven this analysis, option (b) He loses his comeback fight but wins his following three fights seems more likely for an all-time great like Canelo making a return to the ring after a layoff. The first fight back could be rusty, but he should be able to quickly return to form after that initial comeback bout.",

This is a relatively straightforward and common outcome for new startups, especially in the tech industry where many startups fail early on.\n\n3) Option (b) adds an additional condition - that despite failing in the first year, Robert's leadership raises significant interest from major investors. This makes the scenario more specific and introduces an additional qualifying factor.\n\n4) In general, the more specific and multi-conditional an outcome is, the less likely it is to occur compared to a more broad, simple outcome.\n\n5) So option (a), which just states the startup fails in the first year with no other qualifiers, is likely the more probable outcome compared to option (b) which has the extra condition about raising investor interest despite failure.\n\nSo based on this step-by-step reasoning, the more likely answer is (a) The startup fails within the first year.",

While many good movies get nominated each year, there are far more movies released that do not receive Oscar nominations.\n\n3) For a movie to not only receive an Oscar nomination but also make over $500 million worldwide at the box office is even rarer. Very few movies cross that $500 million global box office threshold, let alone also receive an Oscar nomination.\n\n4) Since the second event (b) has two difficult criteria that need to be met (Oscar nomination AND $500 million+ box office), its probability is lower than just receiving an Oscar nomination in general.\n\nTherefore, based on the probabilities, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) The movie receives an Oscar nomination.\n\nThis is more likely than (b) because (b) has the additional difficult criteria of making over $500 million worldwide, which significantly lowers its probability compared to just getting an Oscar nomination.",
