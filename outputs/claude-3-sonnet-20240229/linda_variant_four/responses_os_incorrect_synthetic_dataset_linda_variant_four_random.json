For a world tour to sell out all major venues, even if the album doesn't chart, is a much less likely scenario. It usually requires significant popularity and demand for the artist, which is not implied in the given information.\n\n3. Option (b) combines two relatively unlikely events: the album not charting anywhere and the world tour selling out major venues globally.

Reunions for major acts often start slowly but build up to larger crowds if the shows deliver.\n\nOf course, without more details about Emily's popularity, fanbase, tour scale, etc., this is just an educated guess.

After a devastating war like World War II, the immediate priority for any leader would likely be reviving the domestic economy and rebuilding infrastructure before focusing on improving international relations.\n\nImproving international relations would be important, but it may take a backseat to addressing the urgent domestic economic and reconstruction needs first. So while Adenauer may struggle with improving Germany's relations with other countries initially, it's more probable that he would prioritize and succeed in reviving the domestic economy before turning his attention to the international arena.\n\nTherefore, option (b) which states that he fails at improving international relations but succeeds in reviving the domestic economy seems like the more likely scenario given the post-war context.",

Being nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize is already a significant achievement and honor in itself, recognizing the individual's contributions to peace.\n\n2. Not winning the Nobel Prize after being nominated is a relatively more common outcome, as there can be only one winner (or a few winners) each year.\n\n3. Having one's contribution explicitly honored in the Nobel lecture, while being a nominee who did not win, is a more specific and less likely scenario. This additional honor is usually reserved for the actual laureate(s) of the year.\n\nTherefore, the simpler and more probable outcome is option (a), where Ethan D. Young is nominated but does not win the Nobel Peace Prize. Option (b) adds an extra condition of having his contribution honored in the Nobel lecture, which is less likely to occur for a non-winning nominee.",

Sirica refers to the famous judge who presided over the Watergate trials in the 1970s. He gained national prominence for his unwavering commitment to uncovering the truth and upholding the rule of law during those trials, even in the face of intense political pressure.\n\nWhile the question suggests he may compromise some legal principles initially, Sirica's historical actions and reputation indicate that he would ultimately prioritize the integrity of the legal process over any temporary lapses or compromises. His handling of the Watergate case demonstrated his dedication to ensuring a fair and thorough legal process.\n\nTherefore, option (b) aligns more closely with Sirica's established character and the precedent he set during the Watergate trials, making it the more probable choice based on the information we have about him.",
