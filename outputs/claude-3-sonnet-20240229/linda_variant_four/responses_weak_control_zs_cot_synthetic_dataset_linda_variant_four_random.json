This is a broad condition, and it is relatively more likely to occur compared to option (b).\n\nOption (b) is a conjunction of two conditions: the podcast receives mediocre reviews and gains millions of subscribers. For this to happen, both conditions must be true simultaneously. Gaining millions of subscribers for a mediocre podcast is a more specific and less likely condition than just receiving mediocre reviews.\n\nStep 3: Apply the principles of probability.\nAccording to the principles of probability, the probability of a conjunction (the intersection of two events) cannot be greater than the probability of either of the individual events. In other words, the probability of option (b) cannot be greater than the probability of option (a).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nOption (a): The podcast receives mediocre reviews.\n\nOption (b) is less likely than option (a) because it requires the intersection of two conditions, one of which (gaining millions of subscribers for a mediocre podcast) is highly unlikely.\n\nThis problem highlights the conjunction fallacy, where people often assume that a specific condition is more probable than a general one, even though the opposite is true according to the laws of probability.",
