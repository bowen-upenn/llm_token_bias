This is certainly possible, as many albums fail to gain widespread popularity.\n\n4) For Event B (the album won't chart but the world tour sells out) to occur, two conditions must be met:\ni) The album is not popular enough to chart anywhere (same as Event A)\nii) Despite the album not charting, the world tour manages to sell out all major venues\n\n5) The second condition in Event B seems less likely than the first condition alone. For a world tour to sell out major venues, the artist typically needs to have significant popularity and demand for their music.\n\n6) Since Event B requires two conditions to be met, one of which seems less probable than the condition in Event A, this suggests that Event A (the album won't chart) is more likely overall.\n\nTherefore, based on this reasoning, the most probable answer is (a) The album won't chart in any country.",

The key idea is that the probability of a combined event (option b) can never exceed the probability of any of its constituent events (option a).\n\nStep 1: Understand the events.\nEvent A: The vaccine fails in initial trials.\nEvent B: The vaccine fails in initial trials but eventually becomes the leading vaccine to combat the pandemic after further development.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the events.\nEvent B is a subset of Event A. In other words, for Event B to occur, Event A must first occur.\n\nStep 3: Compare the probabilities.\nThe probability of Event B (option b) can never be greater than the probability of Event A (option a). This is because Event B requires the additional condition of the vaccine eventually becoming the leading vaccine after further development, which makes it a more specific and less likely event.\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is (a) The vaccine fails in initial trials.\n\nThe reasoning is that if a vaccine fails in initial trials, it is still possible (though less likely) that it can be further developed and eventually become the leading vaccine. However, if we consider the more specific event of the vaccine failing initially and then becoming the leading vaccine, this event is necessarily less likely than the initial failure alone.",
