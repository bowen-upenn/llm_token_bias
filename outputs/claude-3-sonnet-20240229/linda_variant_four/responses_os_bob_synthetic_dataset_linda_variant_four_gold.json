While their popularity and mainstream appeal may have waned compared to their peak years, they still have a dedicated fan following that would likely ensure strong ticket sales for a world tour, especially at major venues.\n\nHowever, it is less likely that a new album from The Rolling Stones would fail to chart in any country, given their iconic status and the anticipation among fans for new material. Even if the album does not achieve the same level of commercial success as their classic albums, it would be unusual for it to not chart at all in any country, considering their enduring popularity and the loyalty of their fanbase.\n\nTherefore, option (b) which suggests that the album won't chart but the world tour would sell out major venues is more plausible than option (a) which states that the album won't chart in any country.",

While Jeff Bezos has significant resources and experience in the tech industry, his involvement alone does not guarantee the success of a startup, especially in the early stages.\n\n3.

Many factors beyond just funding contribute to a startup's success or failure.\n\n4.

It is highly unlikely for someone without formal training or exceptional natural talent to become a celebrated artist in the contemporary art scene solely based on their artistic innovation or merit.\n\n3.

Ayatollah Khomeini was the former Supreme Leader of Iran and a prominent figure in the Iranian Revolution, which established an Islamic Republic in Iran. His views and ideology were often seen as controversial and anti-Western, particularly in the United States.\n\n2. While it's possible that a memoir by a figure like Khomeini could garner interest and sales in the United States due to his historical significance and controversial nature, it's also likely that the content of the memoir would be critical of Western values and policies, particularly those of the United States.\n\n3. Given Khomeini's strong Islamic and anti-Western views, it's highly probable that the content of the memoir would be seen as objectionable or offensive in several Middle Eastern countries, particularly those with more conservative or authoritarian regimes, leading to potential bans or censorship.\n\nTherefore, while it's not impossible for the memoir to become a bestseller in the United States due to curiosity or controversy, it's more likely that it would face bans or censorship in several Middle Eastern countries due to its expected content and Khomeini's ideological stance.",

His previous albums have generally performed extremely well on the Billboard charts, with several of them reaching #1.\n\nWhile it's possible that his new album may not crack the top 10 on the Billboard 200 album chart (option a), it's even less likely that the album would underperform to that degree while still managing to produce a massive hit single that tops the Billboard Hot 100 chart for multiple weeks (option b).\n\nFor a global superstar like Ed Sheeran, having an album miss the top 10 entirely would be considered a relative underperformance. But to then also have one of the singles become a multi-week #1 smash hit would be an unusual scenario.\n\nSo between the two options provided, option (b) appears to be the more likely scenario, even if both options have a relatively low probability overall given Ed's consistent mainstream success. My reasoning is that it's more plausible for the album itself to miss the top 10 than for it to miss the top 10 while yielding a huge #1 hit single.",
