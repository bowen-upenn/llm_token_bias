However, based on the general probabilities:\n\n(a) Jessica Harris will lose in the primary elections.\n\nThis option is more likely than (b). It is very common for most presidential candidates to lose in the primary elections, as there are usually many contenders vying for the nomination and only one can ultimately win the primaries. So losing in the primaries is the more prevalent and probable outcome for any given candidate.\n\n(b) Jessica Harris will lose in the primary elections but be chosen as the vice-presidential candidate again.\n\nThis is a more specific and less likely scenario. To be chosen as a vice-presidential candidate after losing in the primaries requires a particular set of circumstances and calculations by the eventual nominee. It is rarer than simply losing in the primaries.\n\nSo based on general probabilities, (a) Jessica Harris will lose in the primary elections is the more likely option. But without details on her specific candidacy, it's impossible to make a definitive judgment.",
