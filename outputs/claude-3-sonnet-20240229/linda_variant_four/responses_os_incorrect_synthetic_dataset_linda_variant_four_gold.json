Between the two provided options, I cannot definitively say which is more likely as there are many hypothetical factors involved. However, I can provide some analysis on each option:\n\n(a) He would not understand modern political issues.\nIt is quite plausible that if De Gaulle, who died in 1970, were to return today, he might struggle to fully grasp the complexities of modern political issues. The world has undergone significant changes socially, technologically, economically, and geopolitically in the past several decades. His understanding would likely be limited by being out of touch with current affairs for an extended period.\n\n(b) He would not understand modern political issues but still gain a significant following due to his historical reputation.\nWhile De Gaulle's lack of understanding of contemporary issues might make it difficult for him to campaign effectively on policy matters, his historical stature and reputation could potentially garner him a significant following, at least initially. His iconic status as a WWII leader and former French president could resonate with some segments of the population nostalgic for his era or drawn to his perceived strength of character.\n\nUltimately, without being able to predict human behavior and societal dynamics, it is challenging to definitively state which scenario is more likely. Both options have plausible aspects but also face potential obstacles. If pressed, I would say option (a) seems slightly more likely, as adapting to the modern political landscape might prove too challenging for someone displaced from that era.

Marshall was an extremely capable diplomat and statesman, brokering a groundbreaking international agreement in today's complex geopolitical landscape without being fully immersed in contemporary issues and dynamics would be an extraordinary challenge. It's more realistic that he would initially struggle to grasp all the nuances of modern geopolitics before being able to make breakthroughs.\n\nSo if I have to choose between the two options, I would say (a) is more likely - that he would struggle to understand contemporary geopolitics if transported to the present day. Option (b), while not impossible for someone of his talents, sets a very high bar that would be difficult to achieve without extensive preparation and understanding of current affairs.",
