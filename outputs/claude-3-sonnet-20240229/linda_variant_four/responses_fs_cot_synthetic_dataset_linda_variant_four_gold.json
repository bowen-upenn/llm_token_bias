However, there is always a chance of an upset in boxing.\n\n2) The probability of Canelo losing his next fight AND winning the rematch with a knockout is even lower. For this to happen, two specific outcomes need to occur:\na) Canelo loses his next fight (already a low probability event)\nb) In the rematch, not only does Canelo win, but he wins by knockout (a subset of all possible ways he could win the rematch)\n\nSince the combination of these two events is more specific and less likely than just Canelo losing his next fight, option (a) Canelo loses his next fight is more probable than option (b).\n\nSo based on the probabilities involved, the correct answer is (a) Canelo loses his next fight.",

However, within those poor reviews, Jennifer Aniston's individual performance would need to be praised as a bright spot.\n\n4) While not impossible, option (b) adds an extra condition/qualification on top of the movie getting bad reviews.

However, their fanbase is now older with more disposable income.\n\n4) If the first concert has low turnout initially, that very fact could drive more media attention and nostalgia, boosting ticket sales for later concerts on the tour as it gains momentum.\n\n5) Their global fame and lasting popularity makes it more plausible that even if the first show underwhelms, they could still sell out larger stadiums later as the tour hype builds.\n\nSo based on that analysis, option (b) \"The first concert has low audience turnout but they sell out multiple stadiums later in the tour\" seems more likely than just having universally low turnout for the entire tour.",

This is certainly possible, as musical tastes and charts can be fickle, but it seems unlikely given The Beatles' iconic status and fan base.\n\n3) Option (b) states that the album does not chart, but their tour still sells out multiple stadiums globally. This option combines an unlikely event (the album not charting) with a very likely event (selling out huge venues for a reunion tour).\n\n4) For a band as legendary and popular as The Beatles, it seems highly improbable that a new album wouldn't chart at all if they reunited. Fans would surely buy it in large numbers out of curiosity and nostalgia if nothing else.\n\n5) However, even if the album underperformed, their enduring fame and appeal would almost certainly lead to a hugely successful global tour with sold-out stadiums.\n\nSo in summary, while both options seem improbable, option (b) is more likely because it combines an unlikely event (no charting) with a very likely event (sold-out reunion tour).

Sometimes movies that critics love don't resonate with general audiences for various reasons.\n\n7) So while neither outcome is impossible, based on typical movie performance patterns, option (a) \"The movie receives high critical acclaim\" seems more likely than option (b) which requires two semi-contradictory things to occur.\n\nSo in summary, my reasoning is that option (a) is more probable than the combined conditions in option (b).
