Understand the question: The question asks which of the two options is more likely to occur regarding the success or failure of Leonardo DiCaprio's new movie.\n\n2. Analyze option (a): \"The movie receives critical backlash and fails at the box office.\" This option involves two events happening simultaneously: critical backlash and box office failure.\n\n3. Analyze option (b): \"The movie receives critical backlash, fails at the box office, but Leonardo DiCaprio wins an award for his performance.\" This option involves three events happening simultaneously: critical backlash, box office failure, and Leonardo DiCaprio winning an award for his performance.\n\n4. Consider the conjunction fallacy: The conjunction fallacy is a cognitive bias that occurs when people judge the probability of a conjunction (the co-occurrence of two or more events) as being more likely than the probability of either of the individual events occurring alone.\n\n5. Logically, option (b) should be less likely than option (a) because it involves the conjunction of three events, while option (a) involves the conjunction of only two events. For option (b) to occur, all three events must happen simultaneously, which makes it less probable than option (a), where only two events need to occur.\n\nBased on this logical reasoning, the more likely option is (a): \"The movie receives critical backlash and fails at the box office.\"\n\nIt's important to note that the conjunction fallacy can lead people to intuitively judge option (b) as more likely, even though it involves a conjunction of more events and should be less probable. This is because the additional detail of Leonardo DiCaprio winning an award might make the scenario seem more plausible or representative, leading to the fallacious judgment.",

According to the rules of probability, the probability of two events occurring together (winning an Academy Award for Best Actress and playing the role of a judge) can never be greater than the probability of a single event (winning an Academy Award for Best Actress) alone.\n\nThis question is designed to explore the conjunction fallacy, which is a cognitive bias where people tend to overestimate the probability of a conjunction (two events occurring together) compared to the probability of a single event.\n\nIn this case, option (b) might seem more plausible or representative because it provides additional detail about the role (playing a judge), which aligns with Judge Judy's real-life profession. However, this additional detail actually makes the event less likely, not more likely, than simply winning the Best Actress award without any specific condition on the role.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Option (a) represents a single event: Judge Judy winning an Academy Award for Best Actress.\n2. Option (b) represents a conjunction of two events: Judge Judy winning an Academy Award for Best Actress AND playing the role of a judge in the movie.\n3.

Since the conjunction includes an additional condition (playing a judge), it is necessarily less likely or equally likely (but never more likely) than the single event of winning Best Actress alone (option a).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) She wins an Academy Award for Best Actress, as it is always at least as probable as the conjunction (b).",

The question presents two options: (a) Kamala Harris will lose in the primary elections, and (b) Kamala Harris will lose in the primary elections but be chosen as the vice-presidential candidate again.\n\n2. Option (b) is a more specific scenario that includes the condition from option (a) (losing in the primary elections) and an additional condition (being chosen as the vice-presidential candidate again).\n\n3. According to the principles of probability, a more specific and complex scenario (like option (b)) should be less likely or have a lower probability of occurring compared to a more general scenario (like option (a)).\n\n4. This is because option (b) requires not only the condition of losing in the primary elections but also the additional condition of being chosen as the vice-presidential candidate again, which adds an extra constraint and makes the scenario less likely.\n\n5. Therefore, based on the conjunction fallacy, which is a well-known cognitive bias where people tend to overestimate the probability of conjunctive events (events that require multiple conditions to occur simultaneously), option (a) should be more likely than option (b).\n\nIn summary, the more probable option is (a) Kamala Harris will lose in the primary elections, as it is a more general scenario and does not include the additional constraint of being chosen as the vice-presidential candidate again.",
