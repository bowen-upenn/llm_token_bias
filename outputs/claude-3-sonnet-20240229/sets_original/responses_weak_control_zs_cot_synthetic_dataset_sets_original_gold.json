The first premise \"All pigs are animals\" is a universal affirmative statement (A-type premise) and distributes the subject term \"pigs\" but not the predicate term \"animals.\"\n2. The second premise \"Some animals have tusks\" is a particular affirmative statement (I-type premise) and does not distribute either the subject term \"animals\" or the predicate term \"have tusks.\"\n3. In a valid syllogistic argument, the middle term (in this case, \"animals\") must be distributed at least once in the premises. However, in this argument, the middle term \"animals\" is not distributed in either premise.\n4. The conclusion \"Therefore some pigs have tusks\" is a particular affirmative statement (I-type conclusion) and requires the subject term \"pigs\" to be undistributed in at least one premise.\n5. Since the middle term \"animals\" is not distributed in either premise, it is not possible to validly conclude whether \"some pigs have tusks\" or not.\n\nThe fallacy occurs because the argument tries to establish a relationship between the distributed subject term \"pigs\" and the undistributed predicate term \"have tusks\" through the undistributed middle term \"animals.\" This violates the rules of valid syllogistic reasoning, leading to an invalid conclusion.",
