While it is true that all trains are vehicles (from premise 1), and that some vehicles have four wheels (from premise 2), it does not mean that the vehicles with four wheels specifically refer to trains. There are many other types of vehicles with four wheels, such as cars, trucks, and vans.\n\nFor the conclusion to be logically sound, the premises would need to state that some trains are vehicles with four wheels specifically. As it stands, the argument is invalid because the conclusion goes beyond what can be inferred from the given premises.",
