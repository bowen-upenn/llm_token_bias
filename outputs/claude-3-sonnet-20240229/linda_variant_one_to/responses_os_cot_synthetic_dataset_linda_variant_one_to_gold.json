Marty's initial reward system was ineffective in motivating Rick to floss.\n2. Rick regretted not flossing when he developed gingivitis, indicating that he experienced negative consequences.\n3. To address this issue, Marty would likely increase the reward to make it more appealing for Rick to floss.\n4. Additionally, Marty would want to avoid further dental issues like gingivitis for Rick, which could be achieved by motivating him to floss through an increased reward.\n\nTherefore, option (b) \"Marty would likely increase the reward to motivate Rick to floss to avoid further dental issues like gingivitis\" is more likely because it considers both motivating Rick to floss and preventing potential dental problems that could arise from not flossing.",

It adds the additional detail that Sam would be looking for stylish, high-heeled shoes specifically.\n\n3) According to the information given, we know that Sam had to rip the heel off of one of her shoes because it got stuck in a grate.

The primary goal is to capture evidence of ghostly presences or phenomena.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate option (a).\nPreparing equipment and researching common ghost hunting techniques aligns with the basic premise of ghost hunting. It is a reasonable and expected action for someone participating in their first ghost hunting adventure.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate option (b).\nThis option includes an additional element of \"ensuring effective communication with any spirits she encounters.\" While communicating with spirits is sometimes a part of ghost hunting, it may not necessarily be the primary focus, especially for a beginner.\n\nStep 4: Compare the options.\nOption (a) covers the essential preparation and research required for a typical ghost hunting experience, without making any assumptions about communicating with spirits.\nOption (b) includes an additional and potentially unnecessary assumption about communicating with spirits, which may or may not be Jennifer's intention.\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, option (a) \"Jennifer would prepare her equipment and research common ghost hunting techniques\" is more likely and aligned with the given information.",

Going to bed early after spending the entire evening on homework seems less likely.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate option (b) \"Miguel would probably go to bed early to wake up refreshed for school the next day.\"\nThis option provides a reasonable explanation or motivation for Miguel going to bed early.

Option (a) states that James would likely replace his toothbrush regularly, which is a broad statement without any specific reason mentioned.\n\n3. Option (b) states that James would likely replace his toothbrush regularly to ensure that it always remained effective at preventing cavities, which provides a specific reason for replacing his toothbrush regularly.\n\n4. Since the given information mentions that James had ten toothbrushes and he really cared about his teeth, brushing them many times a day, it is reasonable to assume that he would be conscious about maintaining proper oral hygiene.\n\n5. Replacing toothbrushes regularly is generally recommended to maintain effectiveness in removing plaque and preventing cavities, as toothbrushes can become worn out and harbor bacteria over time.\n\nBased on these points, option (b) seems more likely or probable because it provides a specific and relevant reason for James to replace his toothbrush regularly, which aligns with his concern for his teeth and oral hygiene. Option (a) is a broader statement without any explicit reason mentioned.\n\nTherefore, the more logical and likely answer is (b) James would likely replace his toothbrush regularly to ensure that it always remained effective at preventing cavities.",

Consider the evidence: The given information does not explicitly mention Pat's desire or intention to expand his repertoire. It only states that he practiced a song and performed it successfully.\n\nBased on the available information and the comparison of the options, the more likely choice is (a) \"Pat would likely continue practicing and performing music.\" This option is supported by the fact that Pat has already shown interest and competence in practicing and performing music, without specifying any particular goal or reason beyond that.\n\nOption (b) introduces an additional detail (expanding his repertoire) that is not directly supported by the given information.
