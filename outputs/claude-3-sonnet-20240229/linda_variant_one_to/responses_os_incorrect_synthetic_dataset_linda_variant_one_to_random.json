It then mentions that the new pants fit him perfectly and he was happy they were no longer too tight. This directly implies that Jordan would continue wearing the new pair of pants going forward, as they fit him well and resolved the issue of his old pants being too tight.\n\nOption (b) \"Jordan would continue wearing the new pair of pants to a musical concert\" is more specific and not necessarily supported by the given information. While it's possible Jordan could wear the new pants to a concert, the passage doesn't mention anything about a concert or provide any context that would make that scenario more likely than just generally continuing to wear the new pants.\n\nTherefore, the more probable option based on the information provided is (a) \"Jordan would continue wearing the new pair of pants.\"",

        "question": "Mark wants to be able to do ten pull ups. Right now he can only do five. He wrote down a regimen and followed it. He started doing more and note pull ups. After a few months he was able to easily do ten pull ups.\nWhich is more likely?\n(a) Mark would continue training to increase his pull-up count beyond ten.\n(b) Mark would continue training to increase his pull-up count beyond ten to learn to play the guitar.",
        "target_answer": "(a) Mark would continue training to increase his pull-up count beyond ten",
        "retry": false,
        "use_multi_agents": false,
        "init_model_answer": "Based on the information provided, option (a) \"Mark would continue training to increase his pull-up count beyond ten\" is more likely.\n\nThe passage states that Mark had a goal of being able to do ten pull-ups, and after following a regimen for a few months, he was able to easily achieve that goal. It is reasonable to expect that once he has achieved his initial goal, he may set a new, higher goal for himself and continue training to increase his pull-up count further.\n\nOption (b) \"Mark would continue training to increase his pull-up count beyond ten to learn to play the guitar\" is less likely based on the given information. The passage does not mention anything about Mark's interest or plans to learn to play the guitar. Introducing an unrelated goal like learning the guitar makes this option less plausible given the context provided.",
