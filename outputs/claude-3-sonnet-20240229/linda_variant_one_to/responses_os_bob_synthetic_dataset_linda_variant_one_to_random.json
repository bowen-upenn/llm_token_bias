It then mentions that Rick regretted this decision when his siblings earned cash rewards and he ended up getting gingivitis (a gum disease often caused by poor oral hygiene like not flossing). This implies that the nickel reward was not motivating enough for Rick to floss. Therefore, it is more logical that Marty would increase the reward amount in an attempt to motivate Rick to start flossing regularly.\n\nOption (b) is less likely as there is no mention of television or using it as a reward in the passage.
