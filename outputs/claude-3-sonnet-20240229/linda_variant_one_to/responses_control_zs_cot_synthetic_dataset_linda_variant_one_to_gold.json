The key is to recognize that option (b) is a conjunction of two events:\n\n1. Mark continuing to train to increase his pull-up count beyond 10.\n2. Mark setting a new goal of 20 pull-ups specifically.\n\nAccording to the rules of probability, the likelihood of a conjunction (two events occurring together) is always less than or equal to the likelihood of either individual event.\n\nSo option (a), which is a single event of Mark continuing to train to increase his pull-up count beyond 10, has a higher probability than option (b), which requires the conjunction of two specific events to occur.\n\nEven though the background story may make option (b) seem more representative or plausible, we must objectivity apply the probability rules. The correct answer is therefore:\n\n(a) Mark would continue training to increase his pull-up count beyond ten.\n\nThis avoids the conjunction fallacy by choosing the option involving a single event over the conjunction of multiple events.",
