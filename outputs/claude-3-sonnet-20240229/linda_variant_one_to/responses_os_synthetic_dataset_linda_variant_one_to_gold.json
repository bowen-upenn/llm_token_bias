Since option (b) is a more specific subset of option (a), option (a) is more likely to be true.\n\nThe principle at play here is the conjunction rule in probability theory, which states that the probability of two events occurring together (a conjunction) cannot be greater than the probability of either individual event occurring. Therefore, option (b) having an additional qualifier \"to work\" makes it a conjunction of two events, and thus less probable than the single event in option (a).",
