From this, we can reasonably infer that Jordan would likely continue wearing the new, well-fitting pants rather than going back to the old, too-tight ones. However, the passage does not provide any specific information about Jordan's workplace or wearing the pants to work, so option (b) makes an additional assumption not supported by the given facts.",

People who are dedicated to self-improvement and achieving fitness goals often incrementally increase their targets once they have reached their initial goals.\n\nOption (a) is also possible, but it lacks the specificity of setting a new numerical target, which seems more consistent with Mark's goal-oriented approach as described in the passage.",
