Increasing the reward is a reasonable strategy that parents often employ to encourage desired behaviors in their children.\n\n(b) Marty would likely increase the reward to motivate Rick to floss to watch more television.\nThis option combines two separate goals: motivating Rick to floss and allowing him to watch more television. While it is possible that Marty may use the reward system for multiple purposes, the premise of the problem focuses specifically on motivating Rick to floss his teeth. Introducing an unrelated goal like watching more television makes this option less likely or relevant to the given context.\n\nBased on the information provided in the problem, option (a) \"Marty would likely increase the reward to motivate Rick to floss\" is more probable or likely to occur.

Option (a) \"Sue would likely check herself for bee stings\" is directly relevant and a reasonable action to take after such an encounter with bees.\n4.

In this case, option (b) is a conjunction of two events: (1) the protagonist starts preparing for the next paper assignment, and (2) the protagonist celebrates with friends at a local caf\u00e9.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the probability of each option.\nOption (a) states that the protagonist would start preparing for the next paper assignment. This is a broad statement that does not include any additional conditions.\n\nOption (b) adds an extra condition to option (a), which is celebrating with friends at a local caf\u00e9. Since option (b) includes both events, it should be less probable than option (a) alone.\n\nStep 3: Consider the given information.\nThe passage mentions that the protagonist loves writing papers, takes care to ensure good grammar, turned in the previous paper early, and received a good grade. It also states that the protagonist is looking forward to writing another paper for class.\n\nThis information suggests that the protagonist is diligent and enthusiastic about writing papers, but there is no explicit mention of celebrating with friends at a local caf\u00e9 after completing an assignment.\n\nStep 4: Determine the more probable option.\nBased on the principles of the conjunction fallacy and the given information, option (a) \"The protagonist would start preparing for the next paper assignment\" is more probable than option (b) \"The protagonist would start preparing for the next paper assignment to celebrate with friends at a local caf\u00e9.\"\n\nThe additional condition of celebrating with friends at a local caf\u00e9 in option (b) makes it a conjunction of events, which should be less probable than the broader statement in option (a).\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is (a) The protagonist would start preparing for the next paper assignment.",

Option (a) simply states that Ben would postpone the training session for another day, which is a reasonable and likely conclusion given his exhausted state.\n4.

Rearranging a sock drawer is a relatively minor and unrelated task compared to the context of being tired from playing with a new puppy.\n6. It is less probable that someone would postpone a training session for the specific and seemingly unrelated reason of rearranging a sock drawer when they are already exhausted from other activities.\n\nTherefore, option (a) \"Ben would postpone the training session for another day\" is the more likely and probable scenario based on the given information.",

It not only requires Tom to apologize and offer an exchange but also specifies that the new gift would be something completely unrelated (a winter coat).\n\nAccording to probability theory, the probability of a conjunction (two events occurring together) can never be greater than the probability of either individual event. In other words, P(A and B) \u2264 P(A) and P(A and B) \u2264 P(B).\n\nIn this case, option (b) is a conjunction of two events: (1) Tom apologizes and offers an exchange, and (2) the new gift is something unrelated like a winter coat. The probability of this conjunction occurring is lower than or equal to the probability of just the first event (Tom apologizing and offering an exchange).\n\nTherefore, the more probable option is (a) Tom would apologize for the misunderstanding and offer to exchange the gift, as it does not include the additional condition or conjunction present in option (b).",

Option (a) aligns with the stated purpose of the pills, which is to help Gregory recover from his illness.\n4. Option (b) introduces an additional condition \"to organize his bookshelf\" which is not mentioned in the given context and seems unrelated to the pills prescribed for Gregory's illness.\n5. According to the conjunction rule in probability theory, the probability of two specific events occurring together (in this case, taking pills and organizing a bookshelf) is always less than or equal to the probability of either one of those events occurring alone (taking pills).\n6. Therefore, option (a) is more probable than option (b), as it directly aligns with the stated purpose of the prescribed pills without introducing an additional unmentioned condition.\n\nUnless there is more context provided that suggests a specific reason for Gregory to take the pills for organizing his bookshelf, option (a) remains the more logical and probable choice based on the given information.",
