Since the new pants fit him well and resolved the issue of his old pants being too tight, it makes sense that he would continue wearing the new, well-fitting pants.\n\nOption (b) states: \"Jordan would continue wearing the new pair of pants to work.\"\nWhile this is also a plausible outcome, it adds an additional detail (\"to work\") that is not supported by the given information. The scenario does not specify that Jordan needs the pants for work or any particular context.\n\nSince option (a) directly follows from the provided details without making any unsupported assumptions, it is the more likely choice between the two options based on the given information.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) Jordan would continue wearing the new pair of pants.",

Rick's siblings earned cash rewards, while Rick developed gingivitis due to not flossing.\n\nOption (a): Marty would likely increase the reward to motivate Rick to floss.\nThis option is reasonable because the current reward (a nickel) was not enough to motivate Rick, so increasing the reward could potentially encourage him to start flossing.\n\nOption (b): Marty would likely increase the reward to motivate Rick to floss to avoid further dental issues like gingivitis.\nThis option is also plausible because Rick has already developed gingivitis due to not flossing. Increasing the reward to motivate him to floss would help prevent further dental problems.\n\nBoth options seem logical based on the given information. However, option (b) provides a more specific and compelling reason for Marty to increase the reward: to avoid further dental issues like gingivitis for Rick.\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is (b) Marty would likely increase the reward to motivate Rick to floss to avoid further dental issues like gingivitis.",

This consideration aligns with the understanding that autistic individuals may handle anger differently and could potentially exhibit behaviors that are disruptive or concerning to others.\n\nStep 3: Compare the options.\nWhile both options present plausible scenarios, option (b) provides a more comprehensive explanation for Eric's potential behavior. By including the detail about avoiding disruptions around his peers, it acknowledges the social aspect and consideration for others that Eric might have, even during an intense emotional state.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and considering Eric's condition, the more likely scenario is (b) Eric might seek a quiet, isolated place to calm down to avoid causing any disruptions around his peers.",

If Ben is exhausted after expending a lot of energy playing with and exercising the new puppy, it makes sense that he would postpone the training to another day when he has more energy.\n\nOption (b): \"Ben would postpone the training session for another day to watch his favorite TV show and relax.\"\nWhile possible, this option adds an extra detail that isn't really supported by the given context - that Ben wants to watch TV and relax specifically. The context just states he was exhausted.\n\nSince (a) directly follows from the context without making unsupported assumptions, it is the more likely option between the two choices.\n\nSo in summary, the correct answer is (a) Ben would postpone the training session for another day.",

It includes the condition that the attention and reactions are specifically about Adam's new haircut.\n\nIn general, when we have one event that is a more specific case of another event, the more specific event will be less probable than the broader event.\n\nFor example, if we were rolling a dice, the event \"rolling a 6\" is less probable than the event \"rolling any number from 1 to 6\" because the first event is a specific case of the second.\n\nApplying this logic to the given question, option (b) is a more specific case of option (a). Therefore, option (a) \"Adam would likely enjoy the attention and reactions from his peers\" is more probable than option (b).\n\nUnless there is some context indicating Adam particularly wanted to draw attention to his new haircut, the broader statement in (a) is more likely to be true.\n\nSo the correct answer is (a) Adam would likely enjoy the attention and reactions from his peers.",
