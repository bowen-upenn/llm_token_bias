Option (a) states a single event: \"Sue would likely check herself for bee stings.\"\n\n2. Option (b) states a conjunction of two events: \"Sue would likely check herself for bee stings\" AND \"to see if any bees had stung her while she was running.\"\n\n3.

Therefore, it is more likely that Sue would simply check herself for bee stings (option a) than the more specific scenario described in option (b), which includes the additional condition of checking for stings specifically from bees that stung her while running.\n\nThe conjunction fallacy often arises because people tend to rely on representativeness or narrative coherence when making probability judgments, rather than applying the rules of probability theory correctly.

Since the first crew member refused to fix the loose board, it is reasonable to expect that the captain would assign the task to another crew member.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the likelihood of option (b).\nThis option adds an additional detail about an \"ongoing storm,\" which is not mentioned in the given information. While it is possible that there is a storm, we cannot assume this without explicit evidence.\n\nStep 3: Compare the options.\nOption (a) is based solely on the given information and does not make any unsupported assumptions. Option (b) introduces an additional detail (ongoing storm) that is not supported by the provided information.\n\nFollowing the principles of probability reasoning, we should prefer the option that makes fewer unsupported assumptions.

Analyze the options:\nOption (a): Tom would continue to monitor and improve his credit score.\nOption (b): Tom would continue to monitor and improve his credit score to ensure he could get even better loan conditions in the future.\n\n3. Compare the options:\nOption (a) is a more general statement, indicating that Tom would continue to work on improving his credit score.\nOption (b) is more specific, stating that Tom would improve his credit score with the specific goal of getting better loan conditions in the future.\n\n4. Consider the conjunction fallacy:\nThe conjunction fallacy is a cognitive bias that occurs when people judge a specific and more complex combination of events as more probable than a single, more general event.\n\nIn this case, option (b) is a more specific and detailed combination of events compared to option (a). According to the conjunction fallacy, people might be tempted to think that option (b) is more probable because it provides more information and seems more representative of the scenario.\n\nHowever, logically speaking, a single event (option (a)) should be more probable than a combination of events (option (b)), as the latter requires more conditions to be met.\n\n5. Choose the answer:\nBased on the logic of probability and avoiding the conjunction fallacy, the more probable option is (a) Tom would continue to monitor and improve his credit score.\n\nWhile option (b) provides more specific details about Tom's motivation, it is a more complex combination of events and should be less probable than the general statement in option (a).",

Option (b) narrows down the reason for the visit to celebrate the purchase of the brother's new house, which is a more specific and less likely scenario than just wanting to spend time with the brother and get to know them better.\n\n5.
