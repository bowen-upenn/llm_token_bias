Given this context, it is reasonable to assume that Jordan would continue wearing the new pair of pants, as they now fit him well.\n\nOption (b) specifies that Jordan would continue wearing the new pants to work, which narrows down the context to a specific situation (work).

After a few months he was able to easily do ten pull ups.\nWhich is more likely?\n(a) Mark would continue training to increase his pull-up count beyond ten.\n(b) Mark would continue training to increase his pull-up count beyond ten to achieve a new goal of twenty pull-ups.",
        "target_answer": "(a) Mark would continue training to increase his pull-up count beyond ten",
        "retry": false,

        "init_model_answer": "Based on the information provided, I would say that (b) Mark would continue training to increase his pull-up count beyond ten to achieve a new goal of twenty pull-ups is more likely.\n\nThe passage indicates that Mark set a goal of being able to do ten pull-ups, followed a regimen, and was able to \"easily do ten pull-ups\" after a few months of training. The fact that he could \"easily\" achieve his initial goal of ten pull-ups suggests that he may be motivated to set a higher goal for himself, such as being able to do twenty pull-ups. People who are driven to achieve a fitness goal often set progressively higher goals for themselves once they have accomplished their initial target. Therefore, option (b) seems more plausible given Mark's dedication and success in reaching his first pull-up goal.",
