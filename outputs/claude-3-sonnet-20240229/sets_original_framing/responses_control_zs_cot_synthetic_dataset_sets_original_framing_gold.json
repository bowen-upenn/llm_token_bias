However, the conclusion attempts to generalize this finding to \"a notable fraction of chips consumed,\" which is not necessarily justified by the premises.\n\nStep 3: Assess the validity of the conclusion.\nThe premises do not provide information about the specific proportion or fraction of chips that are high in salt content. The fact that a \"significant subset\" of snacks (which includes but is not limited to chips) are high in salt does not logically imply that a \"notable fraction\" of consumed chips must also be high in salt.\n\nStep 4: Identify the fallacy.\nThis argument commits the fallacy of composition, which occurs when a conclusion is drawn about a whole based on the characteristics of a part or subset, without proper justification. In this case, the high salt content of a subset of snacks (which includes chips) is incorrectly generalized to a notable fraction of chips consumed, without establishing the necessary logical link.\n\nTherefore, the provided argument is not logically sound, as the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the given premises.",
