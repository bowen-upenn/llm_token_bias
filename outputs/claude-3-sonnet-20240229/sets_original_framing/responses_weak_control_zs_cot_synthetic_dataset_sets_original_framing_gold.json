While it is true that outlets are electrical fittings (Premise 1), and that a subset of electrical fittings has surge protection (Premise 2), it does not necessarily follow that a subset of outlets has surge protection.\n\nThe reasoning assumes that the subset of electrical fittings with surge protection includes outlets, but this is not stated or implied in the premises. It is possible that the subset of electrical fittings with surge protection consists entirely of other types of electrical fittings, such as power strips or surge protectors, and does not include any outlets.\n\nTo draw a valid conclusion, the premises would need to explicitly state that at least some outlets are included in the subset of electrical fittings with surge protection. Without this information, the conclusion is not logically sound.",
