The link between migraine and depression has been well-established by numerous studies. While tinnitus (ringing in the ears) can also be associated with migraine in some cases, depression is a more common comorbid condition compared to tinnitus. Therefore, without any additional information, it is more reasonable to assume that John experiences depression along with his migraine than both depression and tinnitus.",

While tinnitus (ringing in the ears) can sometimes occur, it is not as commonly reported as the red skin rash in dengue cases. Therefore, option (b) which mentions only the red spots over the body is more likely than option (a) which includes the additional symptom of tinnitus.",

This is a common symptom of a brain hemorrhage or stroke.\n\nWhile excessive sneezing can sometimes accompany neurological conditions, it is not a typical symptom associated with a brain hemorrhage. Therefore, option (b) which mentions the weakness of one body side, a characteristic sign of a brain hemorrhage, is more likely than option (a) which includes the less relevant symptom of excessive sneezing.",

Difficulty speaking is not typically a symptom associated with alcoholic hepatitis, unless it has progressed to severe liver failure and hepatic encephalopathy (brain dysfunction due to liver failure).
