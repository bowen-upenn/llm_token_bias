This can cause various symptoms, but the most common ones are chest pain (often mistaken for heart pain) and stomach pain or discomfort.\n\nWhile chest pain alone can occur in GERD due to the backflow of stomach acid irritating the esophagus, it is more likely for a person with GERD to experience both chest pain and stomach pain or discomfort. The stomach pain or discomfort is caused by the reflux of stomach contents, which can irritate the lining of the stomach as well as the esophagus.\n\nTherefore, for a patient diagnosed with GERD, experiencing both chest pain and stomach pain is a more common and likely scenario than experiencing only chest pain alone.",

These symptoms are commonly experienced together in individuals with Hyperthyroidism.\n\nSome key points:\n\n1. Sweating: Hyperthyroidism can lead to increased metabolism, which can result in excessive sweating, even when the individual is not engaged in physical activity.\n\n2. Fatigue: Despite the increased metabolic rate, individuals with Hyperthyroidism often experience fatigue and lack of energy. This paradoxical effect is thought to be caused by the body's inability to use energy efficiently due to the imbalance in thyroid hormones.\n\n3.

Muscle weakness and movement stiffness are common symptoms associated with arthritis, as the inflammation and joint damage can affect the surrounding muscles and limit their ability to function properly.\n\nArthritis, particularly rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis, which are more common in older individuals, can cause muscle weakness due to the following reasons:\n\n1. Disuse atrophy: When joint pain and stiffness limit movement, the surrounding muscles may become weaker due to lack of use.\n2. Inflammation: Chronic inflammation associated with arthritis can lead to muscle weakness and fatigue.\n3. Joint deformities: In severe cases, arthritis can cause joint deformities, which can alter the mechanics of movement and lead to muscle weakness and imbalances.\n\nMovement stiffness is also a hallmark symptom of arthritis, as the inflammation and structural changes in the joints can restrict the range of motion and cause stiffness, especially after periods of inactivity.\n\nTherefore, option (a), which includes both muscle weakness and movement stiffness, is more likely and encompasses the typical symptoms experienced by individuals with arthritis, especially in an older adult population.",
