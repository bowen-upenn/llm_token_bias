AIDS is characterized by a severely weakened immune system, making the body vulnerable to opportunistic infections and certain cancers.\n\nSome common symptoms and complications associated with AIDS include:\n\n1. Muscle wasting (also known as HIV wasting syndrome or cachexia): This is a condition characterized by severe weight loss, muscle atrophy, and weakness, often seen in advanced stages of AIDS.\n\n2. High fever: Fevers are common in people with AIDS due to opportunistic infections that can occur when the immune system is compromised.\n\n3. Other potential symptoms and complications: Pneumonia, diarrhea, oral thrush, certain cancers (e.g., Kaposi's sarcoma, lymphoma), neurological problems, and various opportunistic infections.\n\nConsidering the information provided, option (a) \"Sam experiences muscle wasting and high fever\" is more likely than option (b) \"Sam experiences muscle wasting\" alone.\n\nThis is because both muscle wasting and high fever are common symptoms and complications associated with advanced AIDS, where the immune system is significantly compromised.

This bleeding can result from various causes, such as a ruptured aneurysm, head trauma, or a weakened blood vessel due to conditions like high blood pressure or amyloid angiopathy.\n\nStep 2: Common symptoms of brain hemorrhage\nThe most common symptoms of a brain hemorrhage include:\n\n- Sudden and severe headache (often described as the \"worst headache of one's life\")\n- Nausea and vomiting\n- Altered mental status or confusion\n- Weakness or paralysis on one side of the body\n- Seizures\n- Loss of consciousness\n\nStep 3: Evaluating the given options\nGiven the information provided and the common symptoms of a brain hemorrhage, we can evaluate the likelihood of the two options:\n\nOption (a): \"He also experiences vomiting and headache.\"\nVomiting and headache are two of the most common symptoms associated with a brain hemorrhage. Since John is already experiencing paralysis due to a brain hemorrhage, it is highly likely that he may also experience vomiting and headache.\n\nOption (b): \"He also experiences vomiting.\"\nVomiting alone is also a common symptom of a brain hemorrhage. However, compared to option (a), which includes both vomiting and headache, option (b) is less comprehensive in terms of the potential symptoms experienced by John.\n\nTherefore, based on the typical symptoms associated with a brain hemorrhage, option (a) \"He also experiences vomiting and headache\" is more likely than option (b) \"He also experiences vomiting.\"",

This is because a brain hemorrhage often affects one hemisphere of the brain, leading to impairment on the opposite side of the body.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the given options.\na) He also experiences weakness of one body side.\nThis option is highly likely because hemiparesis or hemiplegia is a common symptom of a brain hemorrhage.\n\nb) He also experiences weakness of one body side and headache.\nWhile a severe headache is also a common symptom of a brain hemorrhage, the question asks which option is more likely. Since option (a) is a subset of option (b), option (a) is more likely as it does not require the additional symptom of headache.\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is:\n(a) He also experiences weakness of one body side.",

It is an inflammatory condition of the liver and can lead to liver damage or failure if left untreated.\n\nThe common symptoms of Alcoholic hepatitis include:\n\n1. Abdominal pain and tenderness, particularly in the upper right portion of the abdomen where the liver is located.\n2. Swelling of the abdomen (ascites) due to fluid accumulation.\n3. Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes) due to the buildup of bilirubin.\n4. Nausea and vomiting.\n5. Loss of appetite and weight loss.\n6. Fatigue and weakness.\n7. Fever.\n\nGiven the information provided in the question, option (a) \"She experiences swelling of the stomach and abdominal pain\" is more likely because both of these symptoms are commonly associated with Alcoholic hepatitis.\n\nOption (b) \"She experiences swelling of the stomach\" is also a possible symptom, but it is incomplete as it does not mention the abdominal pain, which is a common and significant symptom of Alcoholic hepatitis.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) \"She experiences swelling of the stomach and abdominal pain.\"",

It is characterized by symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and sometimes fever.\n\nOne of the common complications of gastroenteritis is dehydration, which occurs due to excessive fluid loss through vomiting and diarrhea. Dehydration can lead to various symptoms, including:\n\n1. Dry mouth and throat\n2. Fatigue and weakness\n3. Dizziness or lightheadedness\n4. Dark-colored urine\n5. Sunken eyes (due to loss of fluid in the body)\n\nSince option (a) mentions both dehydration and sunken eyes, and option (b) mentions only dehydration, it is reasonable to assume that option (a) is more specific and encompasses the potential complications of gastroenteritis.\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is (a) Morgan also experiences dehydration and sunken eyes.\n\nSunken eyes are a specific symptom of severe dehydration, which can occur in cases of gastroenteritis due to excessive fluid loss. By including sunken eyes, option (a) provides a more comprehensive description of the potential complications associated with Morgan's condition.",
