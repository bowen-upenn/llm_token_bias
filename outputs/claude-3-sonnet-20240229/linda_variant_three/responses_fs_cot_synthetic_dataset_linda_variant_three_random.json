Therefore, it is relatively likely or probable that Jordan experiences spinning movements along with dizziness.\n\nStep 2: Consider the probability of option (b).\nOption (b) is a conjunction of two events: experiencing spinning movements and frequent nosebleeds. For this conjunction to be true, both events must occur simultaneously.\n\nWhile spinning movements are associated with Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo, frequent nosebleeds are not typically a symptom of this condition. The addition of the \"frequent nosebleeds\" component makes option (b) less likely or probable than option (a).\n\nStep 3: Compare the probabilities.\nSince option (a) involves a single event that is commonly associated with Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo, it is more probable than option (b), which involves the conjunction of two events, one of which (frequent nosebleeds) is not typically related to the given condition.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) Jordan also experiences spinning movements.",

Some of the common symptoms associated with hypertension include headaches, dizziness, and nosebleeds.\n\nStep 3: Apply the conjunction rule.\nThe conjunction rule states that the probability of two events occurring together (the intersection) is always less than or equal to the probability of either event occurring individually.\n\nIn this case, option (a) involves the conjunction of two symptoms: headaches and nausea. Option (b) involves only one symptom: headaches.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the options based on the conjunction rule.\nSince headaches are a common symptom of hypertension, option (b) is more likely than option (a), which requires the occurrence of both headaches and nausea.\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is (b) She experiences headaches.",
