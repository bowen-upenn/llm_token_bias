It is primarily spread through contaminated food and water or close contact with an infected person.\n\nOption (a) states that Morgan also experiences vomiting and a sudden interest in classical music.\nOption (b) states that Morgan also experiences vomiting.\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the plausibility of each option.\nVomiting is a common symptom of hepatitis A, as the virus can cause inflammation and irritation of the liver and digestive system.\n\nHowever, a sudden interest in classical music is not typically associated with hepatitis A or any other liver disease. It seems unrelated to the given information.\n\nStep 2: Compare the options and choose the more likely one.\nSince vomiting is a plausible symptom of hepatitis A, and the sudden interest in classical music is an unrelated factor, option (b) is more likely than option (a).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (b) Morgan also experiences vomiting.",

The question does not provide any additional information about Jae's specific symptoms or severity of the condition.\n\nBased on this analysis, option (b) Jae experiences mood swings is more likely because mood swings are a more common and widely recognized symptom of Hyperthyroidism, and the question does not suggest that Jae is experiencing other specific symptoms.",

The most common symptoms of gastroenteritis include:\n- Diarrhea\n- Vomiting\n- Abdominal cramps\n- Dehydration (due to fluid loss from diarrhea and vomiting)\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the likelihood of option (a).\nOption (a): Morgan also experiences dehydration and a sudden increase in nail growth rate.\n\nDehydration is a common complication of gastroenteritis due to fluid loss from diarrhea and vomiting. However, a sudden increase in nail growth rate is not a typical symptom or complication associated with gastroenteritis. Nail growth rate can be affected by various factors, such as age, health conditions, and nutritional status, but it is not directly related to gastroenteritis.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the likelihood of option (b).\nOption (b): Morgan also experiences dehydration.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, dehydration is a common complication of gastroenteritis due to fluid loss from diarrhea and vomiting. It is a highly likely occurrence in patients with gastroenteritis, especially if the symptoms are severe or prolonged.\n\nBased on the analysis, option (b) Morgan also experiences dehydration is more likely and plausible compared to option (a), which includes an unlikely symptom (sudden increase in nail growth rate) along with dehydration.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (b) Morgan also experiences dehydration.",
