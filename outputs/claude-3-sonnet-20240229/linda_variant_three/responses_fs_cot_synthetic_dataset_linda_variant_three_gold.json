The question stem provides information about Pat being a 57-year-old transgender person diagnosed with Dengue fever.\n\n2. Option (a) states that Pat also experiences malaise (a general feeling of discomfort or uneasiness) and pain behind the eyes.\n\n3. Option (b) states that Pat also experiences malaise.\n\n4. Dengue fever is a viral disease transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, and some of the common symptoms include high fever, headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pains, and malaise.\n\nGiven that both options (a) and (b) include malaise as a symptom, and malaise is a common symptom of Dengue fever, we need to determine which option is more likely based on the additional symptom mentioned in option (a).\n\nPain behind the eyes is also a common symptom of Dengue fever, and it is often accompanied by malaise.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) Pat also experiences malaise and pain behind the eyes.\n\nThis option is more specific and includes two common symptoms of Dengue fever, making it more likely than option (b), which only mentions one symptom (malaise).",

However, if left untreated or poorly controlled, hypertension can lead to complications that may cause such symptoms.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the likelihood of each option.\nOption (a) suggests two additional symptoms: lack of concentration and loss of balance. While these symptoms can be caused by complications of long-term, uncontrolled hypertension (such as stroke or vascular dementia), they are less common or less specific to hypertension alone.\n\nOption (b) suggests one additional symptom: lack of concentration. This symptom can be associated with hypertension, although it is not a direct symptom. Hypertension can cause cognitive impairment, including problems with attention and concentration, due to its effects on cerebral blood flow and potential damage to brain structures over time.\n\nStep 3: Comparison and conclusion.\nSince option (b) involves a single symptom (lack of concentration) that is more directly linked to hypertension and its complications, it is more likely than option (a), which involves two less common or less specific symptoms (lack of concentration and loss of balance).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (b) She also experiences a lack of concentration.",
