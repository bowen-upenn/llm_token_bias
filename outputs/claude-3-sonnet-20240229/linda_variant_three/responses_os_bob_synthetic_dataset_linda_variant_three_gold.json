Jaundice is a common symptom of hepatitis A due to the buildup of bilirubin in the blood as the liver's ability to process it is impaired.\n\nWhile vomiting alone could be a symptom of hepatitis A, the combination of vomiting and yellowing of the eyes (jaundice) is more specific and indicative of hepatitis A infection.

Some of the common symptoms of dengue fever include high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pain, nausea, vomiting, swollen glands, and rashes or red spots on the body. Chills are also a frequent symptom experienced by those infected with the dengue virus. Therefore, given that Leilani has been diagnosed with dengue, it is more likely that she is experiencing both red spots over her body and chills along with other symptoms of the disease.",
