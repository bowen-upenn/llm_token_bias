Chest pain or discomfort: High blood pressure can increase the workload on the heart, leading to angina (chest pain) or even heart attacks.\n\n2. Fatigue or tiredness: The heart has to work harder to pump blood against the increased resistance caused by high blood pressure, which can result in feelings of fatigue or low energy levels.\n\n3. Headaches: Increased blood pressure can cause headaches, particularly in the morning.\n\n4. Shortness of breath: High blood pressure can strain the heart and lungs, making it difficult to breathe.\n\n5. Nosebleeds: The increased pressure in the blood vessels can cause nosebleeds.\n\nWhile chest pain alone (option b) can be a symptom of hypertension, the combination of chest pain and fatigue (option a) is more comprehensive and suggests additional strain on the cardiovascular system, making it a more likely presentation in someone with hypertension.\n\nIt's important to note that the presence and severity of symptoms can vary among individuals, and some people with hypertension may not experience any noticeable symptoms at all.

This is because the muscles surrounding the affected joints may become weaker due to disuse or lack of proper muscle activation caused by joint pain and inflammation. Additionally, some types of arthritis, like rheumatoid arthritis, can cause systemic inflammation that may also contribute to muscle weakness.\n\nOn the other hand, tinnitus (ringing or buzzing sound in the ears) is not typically associated with arthritis unless the individual has another underlying condition that could cause tinnitus. Tinnitus is more commonly linked to conditions like hearing loss, exposure to loud noises, certain medications, or underlying neurological disorders.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, it is more likely that the 55-year-old African American woman with arthritis would experience muscle weakness as a secondary symptom rather than both muscle weakness and tinnitus.",
