In other words, the probability of \"vomiting and chest pain\" (option a) cannot be greater than the probability of \"vomiting\" alone (option b).\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The probability of a single event (like \"vomiting\") is always greater than or equal to the probability of a conjunction of events (like \"vomiting and chest pain\").\n2. Since vomiting is one of the components of the conjunction in option (a), its probability alone (option b) must be greater than or equal to the probability of the conjunction.\n3. Therefore, option (b) \"He also experiences vomiting\" is more likely than option (a) \"He also experiences vomiting and chest pain.\"\n\nThe conjunction fallacy occurs because our intuition often leads us to judge the combination of specific and vivid events as more likely than a single event, even though this violates the rules of probability.\n\nSo, the correct answer to the question is (b) \"He also experiences vomiting.\"",
