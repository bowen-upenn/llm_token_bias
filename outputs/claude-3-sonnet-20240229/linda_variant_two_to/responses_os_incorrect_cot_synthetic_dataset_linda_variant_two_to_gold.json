It suggests that there is a rumor that actress Chlo\u00eb Sevigny will play the role of Lovelace in a film or project related to Demi.\n\nStatement (b): \"Demi's Lovelace role is rumored to be filled by Chlo\u00eb Sevigny to co-star with Ryan Gosling in her next blockbuster film.\"\n\nThis statement includes additional information beyond the first statement. It not only mentions the rumor about Chlo\u00eb Sevigny playing the Lovelace role but also adds that she will co-star with Ryan Gosling in an upcoming blockbuster film.\n\nTo determine which statement is more likely, we need to consider the following:\n\n1. The more information or assumptions a statement contains, the less likely it is to be true, unless there is specific evidence to support all the details.\n\n2. Statement (a) is more general and makes a single claim about the casting rumor.\n\n3. Statement (b) includes additional claims about Ryan Gosling being involved and the film being a \"blockbuster.\"\n\nBased on these considerations, statement (a) is more likely to be accurate or true because it makes a simpler and more focused claim without additional assumptions or details that may or may not be true.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (a) \"Demi's Lovelace role is rumored to be filled by Chlo\u00eb Sevigny\" is more likely than statement (b).",

This implies that there may be concerns about the stepmother potentially tampering with evidence or witnesses related to the grandmother's case.\n\nStep 4: Compare the options.\nOption (a) is a straightforward consideration of whether there is sufficient evidence to indict the stepmother for felony murder in connection with Savannah's death.\nOption (b) introduces an additional motive for the indictment, which is to prevent the stepmother from influencing the grandmother's trial.\n\nBased on the given information, there is no explicit mention of the stepmother's potential involvement or any concerns about her influencing the grandmother's trial.\n\nTherefore, option (a) seems more likely than option (b) because it is a simpler and more direct explanation for indicting the stepmother, assuming there is evidence of her involvement in Savannah's death.\n\nIn conclusion, the more likely scenario is (a): A grand jury indicts the girl's stepmother on a felony murder charge.",

The given context mentions a powerful aftershock hitting one month after a deadly quake in Japan.\n2. It also mentions that Japan observed a minute of silence for disaster victims, indicating a significant loss of life due to the quake.\n3. Additionally, it states that the quake has left more than 13,000 dead and 14,000 missing, further emphasizing the severity of the disaster.\n4. Option (a) only mentions that the crisis at a damaged nuclear plant is yet to be resolved, which is a likely consequence of a powerful earthquake hitting an area with nuclear power plants.\n5. However, option (b) not only mentions the unresolved crisis at the damaged nuclear plant but also specifically states that there are fears of radioactive leakage.\n6. Given the context of a devastating earthquake and the mention of a damaged nuclear plant, the fear of radioactive leakage is a more likely and serious concern compared to just an unresolved crisis at the plant.\n\nTherefore, based on the given context and the severity of the situation described, option (b) \"The crisis at a damaged nuclear plant is yet to be resolved and there are fears of radioactive leakage\" is more likely to be the case.",

Such incidents typically result in disciplinary actions against the offending team and their supporters.\n\nStep 2: Consider common disciplinary measures for similar incidents.\nIn cases of crowd violence or misconduct by supporters, UEFA often imposes sanctions such as ordering the team to play matches behind closed doors (without spectators) and/or imposing fines.\n\nStep 3: Compare the two options.\nOption (a): Serbia also ordered to play two games behind closed doors.\nOption (b): Serbia also ordered to play two games behind closed doors and fined by UEFA.\n\nSince the incident involved violence from Serbian supporters, which led to the abandonment of the match, it is highly likely that UEFA would impose multiple disciplinary measures on Serbia.\n\nOrdering a team to play matches behind closed doors is a common punishment for crowd misconduct, as it denies the team support from their fans and serves as a deterrent. However, UEFA often combines this measure with additional sanctions, such as fines, to further penalize the offending team and discourage future incidents.\n\nTherefore, option (b) \"Serbia also ordered to play two games behind closed doors and fined by UEFA\" is more likely, as it aligns with the typical disciplinary actions taken by UEFA in cases of crowd violence or misconduct during international matches.",

It is common for parents to feel overwhelmed, stressed, or neglected at times due to the significant demands on their time, energy, and resources.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the additional information in option (b).\nThe fact that Denuta's children became successful and independent adults suggests that she invested significant effort and dedication into their upbringing, despite potentially feeling neglected at times.\n\nStep 3: Compare the two options.\nOption (a) simply states that Denuta felt neglected, which is a common experience for parents, especially those raising multiple children.\n\nOption (b) adds the context that despite feeling neglected, Denuta was able to raise her eight children to become successful and independent adults, which is a significant achievement that requires substantial effort and commitment.\n\nBased on this analysis, option (b) is more likely because it provides additional context and a positive outcome (her children's success and independence) that aligns with the challenges and potential feelings of neglect faced during the process of raising eight children.\n\nTherefore, the more likely statement is (b) Denuta, 62, felt neglected as she raised their eight children to become successful, independent adults.",

The drug stash was valued between \u00a3735 and \u00a32,435, which is a significant amount, indicating possession of a substantial quantity of illegal drugs.\n3. The fact that he needed brain surgery after a suicide attempt suggests that he may have been struggling with mental health issues or the consequences of drug abuse.\n4.

The statement \"American Psychological Association: Trying to change orientation can be harmful\" suggests that the APA does not recommend or support efforts to change an individual's sexual orientation.\n\n2. The statement \"Group urges mental health professionals not to advocate changing orientation\" further reinforces the APA's stance against advocating for changing sexual orientation.\n\n3. Since homosexuality was de-listed as a mental disorder by the APA in 1975, it implies that it is no longer considered a disorder that needs to be \"treated\" or \"corrected.\"\n\n4. Therefore, the option (a) \"Homosexuality de-listed as mental disorder in '75, but some programs still treat it\" is more plausible, as it suggests that despite the APA's stance, some programs may still attempt to \"treat\" homosexuality, which goes against the APA's recommendations.\n\n5. On the other hand, the option (b) \"Homosexuality de-listed as mental disorder in '75, but some programs still treat it to correct heterosexual behavior\" is less likely because it implies an attempt to change heterosexual behavior, which is not the focus of the given context.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, option (a) is the more likely scenario.",
