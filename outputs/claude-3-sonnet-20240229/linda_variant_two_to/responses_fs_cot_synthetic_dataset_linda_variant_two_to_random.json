A lockdown restricts entry and exit to the campus and secures everyone inside buildings until the threat is resolved.\n\nOption (b) suggests the lockdown was to celebrate an unrelated annual campus event, which is extremely unlikely given the context of a shooting incident and an active gunman in the area.

The passage mentions a top Chinese official, Yu Zhengsheng, calling for an \"absolute fight\" against the \"Dalai clique.\" This implies a strong stance against the Dalai Lama and his supporters.\n\n2. The official stated that talks with the Dalai Lama will only start when he gives up his stance on \"Tibet independence.\" This suggests a tense and uncompromising relationship between the Chinese government and the Dalai Lama's supporters.\n\n3. Given this context, it is more likely that advocacy groups would report incidents of violence or crackdowns by Chinese authorities against Tibetans celebrating the Dalai Lama's birthday, which is seen as a symbol of Tibetan identity and resistance.\n\n4. The second part of option (b), \"to wear traditional costumes,\" seems less relevant and less probable in this context, as the focus is on the Chinese government's opposition to the Dalai Lama and his supporters, not necessarily traditional Tibetan customs.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided context and the tense relationship between the Chinese government and the Dalai Lama's supporters, option (a) appears to be the more likely scenario.",
