Capital murder is an extremely serious charge, typically involving the intentional killing of another person.\n4.

Option (b) adds the phrase \"to celebrate the local town festival,\" which seems completely unrelated and nonsensical in the context of a child's death and a potential murder charge.\n\nTherefore, option (a) \"A grand jury indicts the girl's stepmother on a felony murder charge\" is the more likely and logical choice based on the given information, as it aligns with the gravity of the situation and the legal consequences that may follow.",

The context mentions a gunman, bodies found, and a 13-year-old boy being chased and fired at, indicating a violent crime scene involving firearms.\n\n2.

This implies that the victims were likely involved in some kind of work or employment in the region where Ansaru operates.\n\n2.

Suicide by stepping in front of a train is a relatively common method, and the report does not provide any additional context or reason for Derek Ward's actions.\n\n4.
