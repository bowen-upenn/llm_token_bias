        "init_model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of the conjunction fallacy, which is a logical fallacy that occurs when people assume that specific conditions are more probable than general ones.\n\nIn the given scenario, option (a) states a general condition: \"Funeral company has stringent security patrols.\" This statement does not specify the reason for the security patrols.\n\nOption (b), on the other hand, states a specific condition: \"Funeral company has stringent security patrol to keep fans from visiting Michael Jackson's specific grave site.\" This statement narrows down the reason for the security patrols to a particular event, which is preventing fans from visiting Michael Jackson's grave.\n\nAccording to the principles of probability, a general condition is always more likely than a specific condition that includes the general condition plus additional requirements. In other words, the probability of option (a) is greater than or equal to the probability of option (b).\n\nTherefore, if we follow the logical reasoning, option (a) is more likely than option (b).\n\nStep-by-step thinking:\n1. Understand the concept of the conjunction fallacy, which states that specific conditions cannot be more probable than general conditions.\n2. Option (a) represents a general condition: \"Funeral company has stringent security patrols.\"\n3. Option (b) represents a specific condition: \"Funeral company has stringent security patrol to keep fans from visiting Michael Jackson's specific grave site.\"\n4. The specific condition in option (b) includes the general condition in option (a) plus an additional requirement (preventing fans from visiting Michael Jackson's grave).\n5. According to probability principles, a general condition (option (a)) is always more likely than a specific condition that includes the general condition plus additional requirements (option (b)).\n6. Therefore, option (a) is more likely than option (b).",

It mentions that he said those words to a group of reporters after hearing the news, which makes it a more specific and less general statement compared to option (a).\n\nAccording to the conjunction fallacy, people tend to judge a specific and more detailed scenario as more probable than a general and less detailed scenario, even though the more detailed scenario logically has a lower or equal probability of occurring.\n\nTherefore, based on the conjunction fallacy, option (b) is likely to be judged as more probable by many people, even though logically, option (a) is either equally or more likely to occur since it is a more general statement that encompasses option (b) as a possible scenario.\n\nIt's important to note that the conjunction fallacy is a cognitive bias, and logically, the probability of the more general statement (a) cannot be lower than the probability of the more specific statement (b).",
