Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The premise provides information about a group of singing Atlanta schoolkids who performed at inauguration festivities and gained fame for their \"Vote However You Like\" song.\n\n2) Option (a) suggests they have written another song called \"Dear Obama\" offering general advice to the president. This is a relatively broad statement.\n\n3) Option (b) suggests they have written a song called \"Dear Obama\" specifically offering advice to the president to invest in cryptocurrency. This is a more specific and narrower claim.\n\n4) According to the laws of probability, a general claim is more likely than a specific claim within that general category. In this case, offering general advice to the president (a) is more probable than offering very specific advice about investing in cryptocurrency (b).\n\n5) Therefore, the more likely option is (a) They have written another song, \"Dear Obama,\" which offers advice to the president.\n\nBy avoiding the conjunction fallacy trap of thinking the more specific detail makes it more likely, we can logically conclude that option (a) is the correct answer.",
