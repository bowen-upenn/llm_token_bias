John Kerry calls the report \"another canary in the coal mine\", suggesting it is a warning sign of grave dangers ahead, again consistent with critical temperature rise levels.\n\n3. The U.N. calls for the elimination of greenhouse gas emissions by 2100, which would be necessary to mitigate the critical threats mentioned in option (b) like food security issues and severe weather.\n\nWhile option (a) simply states that humans are causing temperature rises, option (b) goes further to specify that these rises are reaching critical levels with serious consequences like threats to food and more extreme weather events.

Ordering Serbia to play a couple of home games behind closed doors and also imposing a fine would be a common punishment for such an incident of crowd trouble and disruption of a match.\n\nSo option (b), which includes both the closed-door matches sanction and a fine, appears to be the more comprehensive and likely disciplinary measure taken by UEFA against Serbia for the misconduct of their fans in that abandoned match.",

Even though McCain later clarified that he meant the U.S. was founded on \"Judeo-Christian tradition of human rights\", his initial \"Christian nation\" remark would likely still draw criticism from Muslim and Jewish groups for appearing to privilege Christianity over other faiths.\n\n3. The passage notes that McCain said his comments were \"not meant to exclude other religions\", but Muslim and Jewish groups may still take issue with the phrasing and potential implications.\n\n4. Option (b) suggests these groups would want to be included in the national discussion, but the passage does not directly state or imply that. The more straightforward interpretation is that they would criticize McCain's remarks as exclusionary or marginalizing of their faiths.\n\nSo while McCain may have been aiming for an inclusive message about human rights traditions, his specific wording about a \"Christian nation\" seems more likely to draw criticism from non-Christian religious groups like the Muslim and Jewish ones mentioned.

The phrasing about concealing strategic interests implies the U.S. overlooks routine abuses for realpolitik reasons related to its interests in the region.",
