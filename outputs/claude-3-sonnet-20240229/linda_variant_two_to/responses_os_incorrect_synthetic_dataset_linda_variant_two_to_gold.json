Elizabeth Warren is known for her progressive stance and advocacy for social programs, consumer protection, and economic equality. Her being seen as a leader by progressives in Congress suggests they will prioritize defending funding for social programs against Republican opposition.\n\n2. The mention of a \"backlash from progressives\" and battles with Republicans implies they are gearing up to defend their priorities, which for progressives often include maintaining funding for social safety net and assistance programs.\n\n3. The broader context of it being after a midterm election where political power may have shifted also sets the stage for potential conflicts over budgetary priorities between the two parties.\n\nSo while option (a) is plausible, the specific reference to Elizabeth Warren's leadership among progressives points to option (b) being more likely in terms of their specific priorities involving federal funding for social programs against Republican opposition.",
