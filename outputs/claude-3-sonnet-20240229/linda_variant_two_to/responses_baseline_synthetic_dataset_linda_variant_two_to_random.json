The key fact stated is that bird ingestion forced the landing, implying a serious incident that threatened the safety of everyone on board. In such emergencies, the primary concern is ensuring the survival of passengers and crew, not trivial details like ordering pizza afterward. So the straightforward statement that all 155 people survived the landing is far more plausible than the fanciful addition about ordering pizza for dinner after the harrowing experience.",

It mentions that some traditionally Democratic Jews were reluctant to support Obama. In this context, stating that Florida has a significant Jewish population, many of whom are Democrats, is relevant and logical.
