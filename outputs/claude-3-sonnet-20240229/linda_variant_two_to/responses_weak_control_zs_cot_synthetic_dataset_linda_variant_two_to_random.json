Option (b) states \"No injuries were reported in the flooding to people who had previously visited the dam before the incident.\" This is a more specific subset of the general statement in option (a), as it only considers the case of no injuries for a particular group of people (those who had previously visited the dam).\n\n3. Since option (b) is a subset of option (a), it is logically less probable than option (a). Option (a) encompasses all possibilities, including the specific case mentioned in option (b), as well as other cases not mentioned in option (b).\n\n4. Therefore, option (a) \"No injuries were reported in the flooding\" is more likely to be true than option (b) \"No injuries were reported in the flooding to people who had previously visited the dam before the incident.\"\n\nThis type of problem is designed to illustrate the conjunction fallacy, which is a common cognitive bias that leads people to mistakenly judge a specific case as more probable than a general one, despite the logical impossibility of this happening.",

In other words, P(A and B) \u2264 P(A) and P(A and B) \u2264 P(B).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) \"Games taking advantage of screen size will include Vainglory, Asphalt 8\" because it represents a single event and is more likely than the conjunction of events in option (b).\n\nThe inclusion of the additional event \"to include a free coffee coupon\" in option (b) makes it less likely than option (a), which represents a more general statement without the additional constraint.",
