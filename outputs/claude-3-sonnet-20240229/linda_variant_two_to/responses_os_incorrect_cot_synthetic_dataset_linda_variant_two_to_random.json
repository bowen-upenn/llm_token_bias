There is no logical connection between indicting someone for a child's murder and celebrating a town festival. Indictments for serious crimes like felony murder are solemn legal proceedings, not celebratory events tied to local festivals.\n\nTherefore, by carefully considering the context and reasoning through each option, the more likely scenario is Option (a) - A grand jury indicts the girl's stepmother on a felony murder charge.",
