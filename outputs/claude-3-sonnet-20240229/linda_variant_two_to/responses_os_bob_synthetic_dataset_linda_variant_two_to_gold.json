Grand juries usually consist of around 12-23 members, and in most jurisdictions, around 9 out of 12 jurors must agree that there is probable cause that a crime was committed in order to issue an indictment and press charges.\n\nOption (b) is slightly incorrect because it suggests the 9 jurors must agree to bring the case to trial, when in reality, the grand jury decision is about whether to indict and press charges initially. An indictment from a grand jury is then followed by an actual criminal trial if the case proceeds further.\n\nSo the more precise phrasing in option (a) makes it the more likely correct answer given the context about grand jury proceedings being discussed.",

Such a provocative march would likely be seen as disrespectful and controversial by the British government. The phrasing \"would ensure it does not proceed\" in option (b) suggests the Prime Minister would take steps to prevent the march from happening, indicating strong opposition to Choudary's proposal.",
