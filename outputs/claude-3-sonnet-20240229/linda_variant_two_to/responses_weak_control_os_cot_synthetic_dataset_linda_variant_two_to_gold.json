The question provides information about a tragic incident where a 9-year-old girl, Savannah Hardin, died after being forced to run for eating chocolate, and her grandmother, Joyce Garrard, faces a capital murder charge.\n\n2. Option (a) states that a grand jury indicts the girl's stepmother on a felony murder charge. This is a straightforward and plausible scenario based on the information given.\n\n3. Option (b) adds an additional detail that the indictment is specifically to prevent the stepmother from influencing the outcome of the grandmother's trial.\n\n4. According to the conjunction rule in probability theory, the probability of two events happening together (like indictment AND prevention of influencing the trial) is always less than or equal to the probability of either one of them happening individually.\n\n5. Therefore, option (a), which involves only the indictment, is more probable or likely than option (b), which includes both the indictment and the additional condition of preventing influence on the grandmother's trial.\n\nThe conjunction fallacy occurs when people judge a conjunction (two events happening together) as more probable than one of the individual events.
