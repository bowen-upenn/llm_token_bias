This implies that the foreigners were likely targeted for their work or association with a construction firm operating in the region where Ansaru is active (northern Nigeria).\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the plausibility of each option.\nOption (a): It is plausible that foreign workers from different countries were employed by a construction firm in northern Nigeria, as it is a common practice for companies to hire international employees for various projects.\n\nOption (b): While it is not impossible, it seems less likely that foreign workers from multiple countries would travel to northern Nigeria solely to learn how to cook traditional Nigerian dishes. This seems like an unlikely primary purpose, especially considering the volatile security situation in the region due to the presence of militant groups like Ansaru and Boko Haram.\n\nStep 3: Make a logical conclusion.\nBased on the given information and the context of militant groups targeting foreign workers, option (a) appears to be more likely than option (b). The foreigners were likely employed by a construction firm in northern Nigeria for their professional skills and expertise, rather than for culinary purposes.\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is (a) The foreigners worked for a construction firm in northern Nigeria.",
