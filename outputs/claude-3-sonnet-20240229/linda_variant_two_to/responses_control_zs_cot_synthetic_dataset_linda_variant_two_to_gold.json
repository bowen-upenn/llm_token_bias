To solve it, we need to apply probabilistic thinking and ignore the specifics of the narrative contexts.\n\nThe key is to recognize that option (b) is a conjunction of two events:\n1) Lines form early for Lumpia Shack's Philippines-inspired food\n2) Experience some of the best spring rolls served outside of Manila\n\nFor a conjunction to occur, both events must happen together. This makes the conjunction less likely than either individual event occurring alone.\n\nSo looking at just the probabilities:\nP(a) = the probability of \"Lines form early for Lumpia Shack's Philippines-inspired food\"\nP(b) = the probability of \"Lines form early for Lumpia Shack's Philippines-inspired food\" AND \"experience some of the best spring rolls served outside of Manila\"\n\nBy the rules of probability, P(b) <= P(a), since P(b) is a conjunction containing P(a) as one of its components.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) - it is more likely that lines simply form early for the food, rather than the combination of lines forming early AND the spring rolls being among the best outside Manila.",
