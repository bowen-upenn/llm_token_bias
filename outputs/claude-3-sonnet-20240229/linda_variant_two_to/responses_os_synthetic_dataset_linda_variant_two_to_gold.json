The UN Secretary-General and US Secretary of State are expressing urgency and grave concerns about climate change, suggesting that serious threats and impacts are being highlighted.\n\n2. The UN is calling for the elimination of greenhouse gas emissions by 2100, which implies that temperature rises have reached or will reach critical levels requiring such drastic action.\n\n3. Mentioning threats to global food security and severe weather patterns aligns with the tone of urgency and the types of serious consequences being warned about by the UN and world leaders.\n\nSo option (b) captures the more comprehensive and alarming assessment that seems consistent with the context of dire warnings from global leaders about climate change impacts. Just stating that temperatures are rising due to humans (option a) appears to understate the level of threat being conveyed.",
