Her educational background in Environmental Science and Public Policy, involvement in urban gardening projects, promotion of green energy solutions, and cooking traditional Mexican cuisine using herbs from her own garden align with these interests.\n\nHowever, there is no mention of her enjoying geocaching, which is an outdoor recreational activity involving finding hidden containers using GPS coordinates. While it's possible that she may enjoy this hobby, the provided information does not explicitly indicate this.\n\nTherefore, option (b), which states that Mariana works in food preparation and serving related occupations, is more probable based on the given details about her interest in cooking traditional Mexican cuisine and using herbs from her garden.",

She is known for her resilient and compassionate nature, often volunteering for beach clean-ups and community education programs. An avid scuba diver and hiker, Leilani spends most of her free time exploring the natural beauty of her island home. She also enjoys sharing her love for Hawaiian culture and traditions through local workshops and festivals.\n\nWhich is more probable?\n(a) Leilani is a control and valve installer and repairer, except mechanical door, and paints watercolor landscapes.\n(b) Leilani is a control and valve installer and repairer, except mechanical door.",
