Their educational background and interests are focused on environmental science, sociology, and community engagement related to sustainability and social equality. Therefore, the probability of option (a) being true is relatively low.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the probability of option (b) \"Kai Chen is a historian and participates in urban renewal initiatives, fostering community involvement and ecological awareness.\"\nThe first part of the statement, \"Kai Chen is a historian,\" is unlikely based on the given information, as discussed in Step 1.\nHowever, the second part, \"participates in urban renewal initiatives, fostering community involvement and ecological awareness,\" aligns closely with Kai Chen's interests and activities. Their involvement in community gardening projects, advocacy for green urban spaces, and exploration of environmental justice themes through documentary filmmaking support this aspect of the statement.\n\nStep 3: Compare the probabilities of options (a) and (b).\nOption (a) has a relatively low probability of being true, as Kai Chen's background and interests do not directly relate to being a historian.\nOption (b), while containing the unlikely statement of Kai Chen being a historian, also includes elements that are highly probable based on the given information, such as their participation in urban renewal initiatives and fostering community involvement and ecological awareness.\n\nTherefore, considering the overall likelihood of each option, option (b) is more probable than option (a), despite containing an unlikely part.

The given background states that Morgan Rivers has dual majors in Environmental Science and Native American Studies, indicating a strong interest and expertise in environmental conservation and indigenous cultures.\n\n2. It is mentioned that Morgan is deeply passionate about sustainable living and indigenous rights, further reinforcing their commitment to environmental and cultural preservation.\n\n3. The information specifically states that Morgan \"frequently volunteers at local workshops teaching young people about the importance of preserving native plant species.\"\n\n4. While Morgan's occupation is not explicitly stated, their educational background, passions, and volunteer work align more closely with someone involved in environmental or agricultural management focused on sustainability and preserving native species.\n\n5. Therefore, it is more probable that Morgan Rivers is a farmer, rancher, or other agricultural manager who actively engages in volunteering to teach about preserving native plant species, as described in option (b).\n\nThe combination of Morgan's academic qualifications, passions, and volunteer work makes option (b) a more plausible scenario compared to just being a farmer, rancher, or agricultural manager without the additional context provided in the information.",
