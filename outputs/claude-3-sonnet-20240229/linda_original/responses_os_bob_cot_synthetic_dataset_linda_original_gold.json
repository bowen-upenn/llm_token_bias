Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1) Talia's educational background is in environmental science and public policy from the University of Hawaii. These fields of study are not typically associated with quarry work or rock splitting.\n\n2) The description mentions that she is an advocate for sustainable development, combining her academic background with her cultural heritage to promote eco-friendly initiatives. This suggests her work and interests are aligned with environmental conservation and sustainability.\n\n3) Her free time activities like surfing, traditional Polynesian dance, and volunteering at local conservation projects further reinforce her connection to the environment and cultural traditions, rather than industries like quarrying.\n\n4) The passage specifically states that Talia \"often participates in workshops that teach sustainable agriculture techniques to local farmers.\" This directly contradicts the idea that she works as a rock splitter or in a quarry.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information, option (a) \"Talia is a rock splitter, quarry\" is highly improbable. The more likely option is (b) \"Talia is a rock splitter, quarry and often participates in workshops that teach sustainable agriculture techniques to local farmers,\" but the first part of this option (\"Talia is a rock splitter, quarry\") is still highly unlikely given her background and interests.",

Alex Kim's academic background is in environmental science and public policy, which aligns with their commitment to sustainable development and climate activism.\n2. Their interests and activities, such as urban gardening, exploring vegan cuisines, participating in environmental workshops, and volunteering for non-profit organizations dedicated to environmental justice and education, are consistent with their environmental values and passions.\n3. The description does not mention any connection to insurance sales or suggest that Alex works in that field.\n4. However, it explicitly states that Alex participates in local clean-up events to help maintain their city's green spaces, which is consistent with their environmental activism.\n\nTherefore, while the description does not directly state Alex's profession, the information provided strongly suggests that their work and interests are aligned with environmental causes and sustainable practices. The combination of their academic background, personal interests, and community involvement in environmental activities makes option (a) more probable than option (b), which solely mentions insurance sales without any connection to Alex's described passions and activism.",
