Her interests and activism align more closely with careers related to environmental science, public policy, or community outreach rather than food preparation and serving.\n\nWhile she enjoys cooking traditional Mexican cuisine as a hobby, her educational background, activism, and described personality traits make it more likely that her occupation would be related to her fields of study and passions. The additional detail about enjoying geocaching in option (a) seems more plausible given her interests in hiking and community involvement.\n\nTherefore, option (a) \"Mariana works in food preparation and serving related occupations and enjoys geocaching\" appears to be the more probable scenario based on the provided information.",
