It suggests that Bergen believes the killing was a team effort and that the shooter may not have been directly connected to the gun found in the room where bin Laden was killed.\n\nOption (b) adds an unnecessary and unlikely detail about Bergen claiming the shooter wears a lucky pair of socks during important missions, which is not relevant to the given information and seems improbable.\n\nUnless there is additional context suggesting otherwise, option (a) is the more likely and reasonable statement based on the information provided.",
