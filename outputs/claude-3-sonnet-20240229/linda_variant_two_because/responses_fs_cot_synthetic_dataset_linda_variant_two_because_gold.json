The question states that Qatar wanted to provide economic aid to Gaza.\n2. It is well known that Hamas, a designated terrorist organization, has control over the Gaza Strip.\n3. Any economic aid provided to Gaza could potentially benefit Hamas, either directly or indirectly.\n4. Most countries have sanctions in place against terrorist organizations like Hamas, which aim to restrict any flow of funds or resources that could strengthen their operations.\n5. Therefore, it is more likely that Israeli officials would fear that the Qatari aid to Gaza would violate existing sanctions against Hamas, as it could potentially bolster the terrorist organization's capabilities or influence.\n\nOption (b) provides the additional context of existing sanctions against Hamas, which makes it a more complete and likely explanation for Israel's concerns about Qatar's proposed aid to Gaza.",

Mubarak was convicted in the killing of hundreds of protesters.\n2. He was sentenced to life in prison.\n3. He appealed the ruling and was granted a retrial.\n\nOption (a) simply states that a Muslim Brotherhood leader is also to face trial over incitement of violence. This option does not provide any context or connection to Mubarak's case.\n\nOption (b) states that a Muslim Brotherhood leader is also to face trial over incitement of violence because the original ruling (presumably referring to Mubarak's case) was deemed invalid, and a new trial was ordered.\n\nGiven the context that Mubarak's original ruling was appealed and a retrial was granted, option (b) provides a plausible explanation for why a Muslim Brotherhood leader might also face trial. It connects the two events logically.\n\nTherefore, option (b) is more likely because it provides a reasonable justification for the Muslim Brotherhood leader's trial, which is linked to the invalidation of Mubarak's original ruling and the granting of a retrial.",
