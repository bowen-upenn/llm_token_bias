Having a new emir who is eager to improve regional relations could be a factor driving Qatar's outreach efforts.\n\nBased on the analysis, option (b) seems more likely because it incorporates the information from option (a) while also providing additional context that could help explain the situation more fully.",

An MRI scan is a medical imaging technique used to diagnose various medical conditions, including injuries and abnormalities in the body.\n\n2. Neck injuries are a common type of injury that can be detected by an MRI scan, and there could be various reasons for such an injury, such as an accident, trauma, or underlying medical condition.\n\n3. Option (a) simply states that a later MRI scan revealed that Mr. Green had a severe neck injury, which is a plausible and straightforward statement in a medical context.\n\n4. Option (b), on the other hand, suggests that the cause of Mr. Green's severe neck injury was because he wore mismatched socks that day. This proposed causation seems highly unlikely and lacks a logical connection between wearing mismatched socks and sustaining a severe neck injury.\n\n5. While wearing mismatched socks may be an unusual or peculiar detail, it is unlikely to be a direct cause of a severe neck injury unless there is some extremely implausible and convoluted explanation provided.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given and common sense, option (a) \"A later MRI scan revealed Mr Green had a severe neck injury\" is more likely and plausible than option (b), which proposes an unlikely and illogical causation for the neck injury.",

Option (b) also states that the epidemic has killed more than 1,100 people but adds an absurd and unrelated clause \"because the moon is made of green cheese.\" This additional clause is clearly false and nonsensical, making the entire option (b) highly unlikely to be true.\n\n4.

The passage mentions that Jody Sindelar suggests cigarette packs with fewer cigarettes could bolster willpower, implying that reducing the number of cigarettes in a pack could help smokers cut down on their smoking habit.\n\n2. It then states that currently, the only buying option is the full pack of 20 cigarettes, which makes it harder for smokers to control their consumption.\n\n3.
