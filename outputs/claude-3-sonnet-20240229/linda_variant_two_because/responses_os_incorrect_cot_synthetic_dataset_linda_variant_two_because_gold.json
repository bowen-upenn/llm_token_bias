These don't directly relate to the options about Buzios.\n\n2) Option (a) simply states that Buzios offers beaches and nightlife options. This is a straightforward claim.\n\n3) Option (b) makes the same claim as (a) that Buzios offers beaches and nightlife, but it also provides additional context/reasoning that it is because Buzios is a popular tourist destination for both relaxation and entertainment.\n\n4) To evaluate which is more likely between (a) and (b), we need to consider if the additional context in (b) about Buzios being a popular tourist spot makes that option more or less plausible compared to the basic claim in (a).\n\n5) Generally, tourist destinations do offer a combination of beaches/relaxation and nightlife/entertainment options to cater to different visitors. So the context provided in (b) seems reasonable and plausible.\n\n6) Therefore, option (b) which includes that contextual explanation is more likely to be true compared to just the basic claim in (a).\n\nSo in summary, by walking through the context, the more likely answer is (b) because it provides a plausible reasoning for why Buzios offers those amenities.",
