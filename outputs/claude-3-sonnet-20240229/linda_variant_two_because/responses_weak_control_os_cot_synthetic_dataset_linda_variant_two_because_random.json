In this case, option (b) provides additional details about Qatar having a new emir who wants to improve relations, which makes the statement more specific than option (a).\n\nGenerally, the more specific a statement or event is, the less probable it becomes, as it has to satisfy more conditions. Unless there is clear evidence that the additional details in option (b) substantially increase the probability, option (a) should be considered more likely.\n\nStep 1: Assess option (a) on its own merit.\nIsrael fearing any aid would bolster Hamas is a reasonable concern for Israeli officials, given the existing tensions and conflicts in the region.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate option (b) and the additional details it provides.\nThe fact that Qatar has a new emir who is eager to improve relations in the region does not necessarily increase the probability of Israel fearing aid would bolster Hamas. It could be seen as an attempt to improve relations, but Israeli officials may still have concerns about the aid potentially benefiting Hamas.\n\nStep 3: Compare the probabilities.\nOption (a) is a more general statement that captures the core concern of Israeli officials regarding aid to Gaza. Option (b) adds more specific details, which may or may not directly impact the core concern expressed in option (a).\n\nTherefore, based on the conjunction fallacy principle, option (a) \"Israel fears any aid would bolster Hamas, officials say\" is more likely to be true compared to option (b), which includes additional details that make the statement more specific and potentially less probable.",

This is a relatively straightforward claim.\n\n3) Statement (b) adds an additional condition - that she ranks \"Singin' in the Rain\" as her favorite role \"because she enjoys baking cookies on Sundays.\"\n\n4) For statement (b) to be true, BOTH parts must be true - she must rank that movie as her favorite AND enjoy baking cookies on Sundays.\n\n5) Based on the conjunction rule of probability, a conjunction of two events is always less probable than either of the individual events alone.\n\n6) Therefore, statement (a) is more probable than statement (b), as (b) has the extra contingent condition about baking cookies.\n\nSo the more likely answer is (a) Actress ranks \"Singin' in the Rain' as her favorite role.",
