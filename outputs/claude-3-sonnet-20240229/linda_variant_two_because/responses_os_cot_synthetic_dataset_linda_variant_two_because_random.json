This is a fairly broad and non-committal statement.\n\n3) Option (b) adds an additional detail - that the reason it is unclear which engagements he'll attend is because the royal family plans to introduce him to a variety of local customs and traditions.\n\n4) While option (b) provides a specific reason, there is no evidence or mention of this reason in the given passage. The passage does not state the royals' intentions regarding exposing Prince George to local customs.\n\n5) In cases like this, when one option introduces additional unsupported information, it is generally safer to choose the broader, more neutral option that sticks to only the facts given in the passage.\n\n6) Therefore, based on the information provided, option (a) \"It is unclear which of their engagements he will be present at during their tour\" is more likely to be correct.\n\nSo my step-by-step thinking leads me to select option (a) as the more probable answer.",

It also mentions that isolated mudslides occurred, leading to road closures.\n\nOption (a) suggests that mudslides will remain a threat for the next few days, which is a reasonable conclusion given the recent heavy rains and weather conditions in the area.\n\nOption (b) suggests that mudslides will remain a threat for the next few days because the local grocery store is offering a deal on avocados. This option does not logically follow from the given information and appears to be unrelated to the weather conditions and mudslide threat.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information, option (a) \"Mudslides will remain a threat for the next few days\" is more likely and logical to be true.",
