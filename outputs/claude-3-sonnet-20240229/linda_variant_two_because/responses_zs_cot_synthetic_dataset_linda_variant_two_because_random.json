Israel's primary concern is likely to be the potential strengthening of Hamas due to the economic aid, regardless of Qatar's motivations or changes in leadership.\n\nOption (b) provides additional context but does not directly refute or address Israel's stated fear about aid bolstering Hamas. Therefore, option (a) appears to be the more likely scenario based on the given information.",

It also mentions that this solution avoids having to rebuild the city's massive alley system.\n\nOption (a) suggests that the unique concrete also helps to keep the city cooler on sunny days. This is a plausible statement, as certain types of concrete or materials used in construction can have properties that help regulate temperature or reflect heat, which could contribute to keeping the city cooler.\n\nOption (b) states that the unique concrete also helps to keep the city cooler on sunny days because it is made with a secret recipe passed down for generations. While it's possible that the concrete has a special recipe, the statement about it being passed down for generations seems less likely given the context, which is focused on the concrete's ability to clean polluted runoff using microbes.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and the plausibility of each option, option (a) is more likely to be true.\n\nStep-by-step thinking:\n1. The given information focuses on the concrete's ability to clean polluted runoff using microbes.\n2. Option (a) suggests that the concrete also helps keep the city cooler on sunny days, which is a plausible property for certain types of concrete or construction materials.\n3. Option (b) introduces the idea of a secret recipe passed down for generations, which seems less relevant to the context and less likely to be true based on the information provided.\n4.

There is no mention of the color of the airplanes being changed to blue or any connection between the cracks and the color of the aircraft.\n\n3. When an issue like cracks is found on aircraft, it is standard procedure for the manufacturer (in this case, Boeing) and aviation authorities to investigate the cause and conduct testing to determine the root cause and appropriate corrective actions.\n\n4. Therefore, it is more logical and consistent with standard aviation safety practices that the cause is still unknown, and testing is underway to identify the cause of the cracks, as stated in option (a).\n\nOption (b) introduces an unrelated factor (changing the color of the airplanes to blue) as a potential cause, which is not supported by the given information and does not seem plausible in the context of aircraft maintenance and safety.\n\nSo, based on the available information and standard industry practices, option (a) \"Cause is still unknown, testing is underway\" is the more likely and reasonable answer.",

The passage mentions that a district attorney (DA) says officers would impound cars of people who couldn't pay release fees, and the impound lot owner would turn the cars over to the police, who would sell or keep them.\n\n2. It also mentions that among those arrested are the former police chief and the interim police chief, with the interim chief claiming innocence.\n\n3. Option (a) states that a CNN affiliate says the small police department is strained by the number of arrests. This is directly related to the information provided in the passage about the arrests of police officials and the impounding of cars.\n\n4. Option (b) mentions that the small department is strained due to a local bakery offering a new variety of cupcakes. This seems completely unrelated to the information provided in the passage and appears implausible.\n\nTherefore, based on the context and relevance to the information given, option (a) is more likely to be the correct choice.",
