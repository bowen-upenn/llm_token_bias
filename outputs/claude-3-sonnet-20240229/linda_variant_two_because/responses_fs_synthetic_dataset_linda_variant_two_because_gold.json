The simpler statement (a) that his lawyers claim the interviews are an effort to extort money seems more probable than adding an additional motive like (b) about seeking revenge and tarnishing his reputation.

This suggests some kind of explosive incident or attack occurred. When such an event happens, the initial reports usually do not have a confirmed motive as investigations take time to determine the reasons and parties involved. So stating that no motive has been determined yet because the investigation is still ongoing makes more logical sense given the context.\n\nOption (a) \"No motive has been determined yet\" is technically correct as well, but lacks the additional context that the reason no motive is known is because the investigation is still underway. So option (b) provides a more complete and likely explanation.",
