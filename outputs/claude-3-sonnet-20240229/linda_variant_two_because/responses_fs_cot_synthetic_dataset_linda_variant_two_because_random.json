It provides a reasonable explanation for why Israel might be hesitant to accept Qatar's offer of aid.\n\nOption (b): \"Israel fears any aid would bolster Hamas, officials say because Qatar has a new emir who is eager to improve relations in the region.\"\nThis option provides an additional detail about Qatar having a new emir who wants to improve regional relations. While this detail is interesting, it does not directly address or explain Israel's specific concerns about the economic aid bolstering Hamas.\n\nBased on the information given, option (a) seems more likely and relevant because it directly addresses Israel's stated concerns about the aid potentially benefiting Hamas. Option (b) introduces additional information that is not necessary to explain the stated concern.\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is (a) \"Israel fears any aid would bolster Hamas, officials say.\"",

It then mentions that after his former wife's death, Claus von Bulow was saddened by it, according to his lawyer.\n\nThe two options given are:\n(a) She is survived by three children and nine grandchildren.\n(b) She is survived by three children and nine grandchildren because she had a passion for collecting antique teapots and rare stamps, which she cherished dearly.\n\nTo determine which option is more likely, we need to evaluate the information provided in the passage and the inherent plausibility of each option.\n\nOption (a) simply states the fact that she is survived by three children and nine grandchildren. This is a straightforward statement that does not require any additional context or justification.\n\nOption (b), on the other hand, adds an extra detail about her passion for collecting antique teapots and rare stamps, which she cherished dearly. This additional detail is not mentioned or implied in the passage, and it does not directly relate to the information provided about her family members.\n\nBased on the principle of parsimony (Occam's razor), the simpler explanation is generally preferred unless there is compelling evidence to support the more complex explanation. In this case, the passage does not provide any evidence or context to support the additional detail about her collecting hobbies.\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is (a) She is survived by three children and nine grandchildren, as it is a direct statement that aligns with the information provided in the passage without introducing unnecessary or unsupported details.",

Option (a) simply states that Mugabe acted in a nonchalant, celebratory manner while voting, which is more plausible given the reports of his supporters' actions against the opposition.",

The context only states that RAK is undergoing a luxury property transformation and being targeted by international brands/developers.\n\nTherefore, the more likely answer is (a) \"International hotel brands and developers are flocking to RAK to build new facilities and residences.\" It directly matches the information given without making any unsupported additional claims.",
