The masks popularized by the \"V for Vendetta\" film and worn by protesters worldwide are based on Guy Fawkes, who was sentenced to death for attempting to blow up the British Parliament in 1605.\n\n2. The mask has become an international symbol for rebellion and anonymity, according to an Anonymous protester.\n\n3. The information mentions a \"masked march on Parliament in London planned for Guy Fawkes Night on Saturday,\" which aligns with the historical context of Guy Fawkes and the symbolism of the mask representing rebellion.\n\nThere is no indication that the individuals wearing the mask during the planned march are supportive of Guy Fawkes' specific actions of trying to blow up Parliament. The mask has taken on a broader symbolic meaning of rebelling against oppressive systems and maintaining anonymity during protests.\n\nTherefore, option (a) \"Masked march on Parliament in London planned for Guy Fawkes Night on Saturday\" is more likely based on the information provided, as it does not make the additional assumption mentioned in option (b).",
