This is a fairly straightforward and expected diplomatic response to such an aggressive encounter between the militaries of two nations.\n\nOption (b) adds the clause \"so that residents next to the airstrips would hear about its concerns over international airspace.\" This additional detail makes the option seem less likely, as it implies the White House made the objection specifically for the purpose of nearby residents hearing about it, rather than through normal diplomatic channels.\n\nRaising objections through proper channels with the Chinese government over an aggressive military incident is a more likely and standard response compared to doing so explicitly to inform local residents.\n\nTherefore, based on the context provided, option (a) \"White House said the incident was a provocation, raised objection with Beijing\" is the more likely and reasonable choice.",

It then introduces Fadi Hakura's perspective that the Turkish prime minister's popularity is partly due to his stance on Israel. \n\nThe question asks which of the following is more likely:\n\na) If the U.S. manages the situation, then regional implications can be contained\nb) If the U.S. manages the situation, then regional implications can be contained so that more tourists will visit the historical sites in the region\n\nLooking at option (a), this directly follows from the context provided about managing the regional implications stemming from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nOption (b) adds an additional clause about increasing tourism to historical sites in the region. While increased tourism could potentially be a secondary effect of containing regional tensions, the passage does not provide any specific information to support that tourists avoiding the region due to instability is a main issue being discussed.\n\nTherefore, based solely on the context provided in the passage, option (a) \"If the U.S. manages the situation, then regional implications can be contained\" is more likely and relevant to the topics discussed.",

Failing to properly screen bags would be a major breach of their duties and protocols, which could justify such a large-scale firing of employees.\n\nOption (b) Agency said bags not properly screened so that the local sports team could win their upcoming game, is extremely unlikely and unrealistic. There is no plausible reason why the TSA would compromise security screening procedures to help a local sports team win a game. This option introduces an unrelated and implausible motive that is not supported by the given context.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the more probable scenario is (a) Agency said bags not properly screened, as it directly relates to the TSA's primary responsibility and could potentially explain the large number of firings for a serious breach of protocols.",
