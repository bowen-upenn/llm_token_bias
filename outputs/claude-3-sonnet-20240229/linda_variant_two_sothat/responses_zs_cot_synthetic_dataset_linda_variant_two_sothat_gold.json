The passage mentions that a mountain lion was spotted in downtown Santa Monica, which is likely an urban area.\n2. It's generally uncommon for mountain lions to venture into urban areas, as they typically prefer more remote and natural habitats.\n3. However, the passage doesn't provide any additional context about whether mountain lion sightings in urban areas are surprising or not.\n4. Option (a) states that mountain lion spottings are common in Southern California during this time of year, but it doesn't explicitly relate this to the sighting in downtown Santa Monica.\n5. Option (b) not only states that mountain lion spottings are common in Southern California during this time of year, but it also provides an explanation that this commonality makes it \"less surprising that one was sighted downtown.\"\n6. Since mountain lions are typically found in more rural or natural areas, the fact that sightings are common in the region during this time of year could potentially explain why one might venture into an urban area like downtown Santa Monica, making it less surprising.\n\nTherefore, option (b) provides a more logical and complete explanation by connecting the commonality of mountain lion sightings in the region to the specific sighting in downtown Santa Monica, making it the more likely option based on the information given.",

The incident is described as a \"train derailment\" caused by a \"homemade bomb,\" which suggests a serious incident with potential for significant injuries.\n\n2. The information states that Russian prosecutors have launched a \"terrorism investigation\" into the incident, further indicating that it was a severe and potentially violent event.\n\n3. When a significant number of people are reported injured in a serious incident like a train derailment caused by a bomb, it is more likely that those hospitalized required immediate medical attention for serious injuries rather than just routine check-ups or minor injuries.\n\n4. The wording in option (b) \"so that they could receive immediate medical attention for serious injuries\" better aligns with the context of a terrorist bombing causing a train derailment, which would likely result in some serious injuries requiring hospitalization.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided details and the severity of the incident, option (b) is the more plausible and likely statement, suggesting that the 38 hospitalized individuals likely required immediate medical attention for serious injuries sustained in the bombing and derailment.",

Having ties with al-Qaeda could potentially allow them to enhance their capabilities and expand their operations, which aligns with option (b).\n\nOption (a) is a more general statement about the group having ties to al-Qaeda, but it does not explicitly mention the potential reasons or motivations behind such ties.\n\nTherefore, considering the provided context, option (b) appears to be the more likely scenario compared to option (a).",

As an experienced debate moderator and author on the topic of presidential debates, this journalist would likely prioritize maintaining focus on substantive campaign issues during the debates.\n\n2. Admitting to \"dropping the ball\" when Clinton talked about the Monica Lewinsky scandal implies that the moderator allowed the discussion to veer into that controversial personal matter.\n\n3. Option (b) suggests that the moderator acknowledged the misstep of letting the conversation drift into the Lewinsky scandal but did so with the intent of steering it back to more relevant campaign issues.\n\n4. This would align with the expected role of a professional debate moderator to keep the discussion centered on policy and campaign topics rather than getting sidetracked by personal scandals or controversies.\n\n5. Therefore, option (b), which implies the moderator's intention to refocus the debate on campaign issues after the Lewinsky tangent, appears more plausible given the journalist's background and experience.\n\nIn summary, the step-by-step analysis indicates that option (b) is more likely, as it aligns with the expected professionalism and priorities of an experienced debate moderator in managing the discussion and keeping it focused on substantive campaign matters.",

Zack Brown mentioned that he has never made potato salad before, and the end result might be bad.\n\nGiven these points, option (b) seems more likely. Here's the reasoning:\n\n- The massive amount of money raised ($11,000 compared to the $10 goal) suggests that people are not just donating for the potato salad itself but for something more.\n- Zack's admission that he has never made potato salad before and that the end result might be bad implies that people are aware of this and are donating for a different reason.\n- One plausible reason could be that people want to support Zack in learning how to make better potato salad, which aligns with option (b).\n\nOption (a) simply states that donations have come from the UK, France, and Romania, but it doesn't provide any insight into the motivation behind the donations.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the step-by-step analysis, option (b) \"Donations have come from the UK, France and Romania so that Zack can learn to make better potato salad\" is more likely to be the case.",

This implies that the Kentucky Derby, as the first leg of the Triple Crown, has been run annually since then.\n\n2) The passage also states that \"Despite the lack of 'superhorses,' interest in the Kentucky Derby is still high.\" This suggests that the Kentucky Derby is a popular and well-attended event that continues to be held every year, regardless of whether there are exceptionally talented horses competing.\n\n3) Option (a) simply states that the race will be run on the first Saturday in May, which is the traditional date for the Kentucky Derby.\n\n4) Option (b) adds the additional condition that the race will set a new attendance record, which is not directly supported or implied by the information provided in the passage.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, it is more reasonable to conclude that option (a) is more likely to be true, as it aligns with the long-standing tradition of the Kentucky Derby being held on the first Saturday in May, without making any unsupported claims about attendance records.",

Simplicity and distraction-free experience: Flip phones are generally more basic and offer fewer features and distractions compared to modern smartphones. For a busy individual like Jerry Jones, who likely has many demands on his time and attention, a flip phone could be a conscious choice to reduce distractions and focus on important tasks or conversations.\n\n2. Nostalgia or personal preference: Some individuals may prefer the simplicity and familiarity of older technologies like flip phones, either due to nostalgia or personal preference.\n\n3. Privacy and security concerns: Flip phones often have fewer features that could potentially compromise privacy or security, making them a preferred choice for those who value these aspects.\n\n4. Battery life: Flip phones typically have longer battery life compared to modern smartphones, which could be a consideration for someone who needs a reliable device without frequent charging.\n\nConsidering these factors, option (b) seems more likely as it provides a plausible reason for Jerry Jones to choose a flip phone, which is to have a simpler and distraction-free phone experience. As a billionaire and successful business owner, the desire for focus and minimizing distractions could be a driving factor in his choice of a flip phone.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and the potential reasons outlined above, option (b) appears to be the more likely scenario.",

While being the Fenway Park announcer for the Red Sox is a notable role, it alone may not be enough to warrant having one's voice featured at the Baseball Hall of Fame, especially if Beane has only been in the role for a relatively short time (since 2003).\n\nStep 2: Evaluate option (b)\nOption (b) suggests that Beane's voice might be heard at the Baseball Hall of Fame specifically to celebrate his contributions to baseball history. This implies that Beane has made significant and lasting contributions to the sport beyond just being an announcer for a single team. Without additional information about Beane's career or accomplishments, it is difficult to determine if this is a likely scenario.\n\nBased on the given information, option (a) seems more likely than option (b). While it is possible that Beane's voice is featured at the Baseball Hall of Fame, there is no explicit evidence to suggest that it is specifically to celebrate his contributions to baseball history.\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is (a) His voice can be heard at the Baseball Hall of Fame.",
