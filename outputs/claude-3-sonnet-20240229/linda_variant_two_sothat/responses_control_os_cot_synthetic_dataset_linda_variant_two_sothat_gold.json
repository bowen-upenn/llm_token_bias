This makes (b) more specific and constrained than (a).\n\n5) Therefore, following the rules of probability, option (a) is more likely than option (b).\n\nSo the correct answer is (a) \"In Madrid, Analina Rooms offers tastefully modernist brown-and-white interiors\" because it involves a single claim rather than a conjunction of multiple conditions.",
