The Masters golf tournament is a major annual sporting event that takes place around the same time every year (early April). Its end date is pre-determined and has nothing to do with Miley Cyrus or her movie release.\n\n2. There is no logical connection between the Masters golf tournament ending and Miley Cyrus attending any ceremony related to it. She is an actress/singer, not a professional golfer.\n\n3. The statement about \"Observe and Report\" being the opposite of the Hannah Montana movie is just providing a contrast between the two films. It does not suggest any relationship between Miley Cyrus and the Masters tournament.\n\nSo option (a) is the more plausible and likely statement, as the Masters tournament ending on its scheduled Sunday has no correlation to Miley Cyrus or her movie promotional activities.",
