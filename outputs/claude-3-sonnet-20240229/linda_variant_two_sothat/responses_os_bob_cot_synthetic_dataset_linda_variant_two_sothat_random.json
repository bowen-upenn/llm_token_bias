Here's the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1) The passage mentions that the Pentagon reported a Chinese fighter jet made several \"dangerous\" passes at a U.S. Navy patrol plane in the South China Sea, coming within 20 feet at one point.\n\n2) This type of aggressive encounter in international airspace is a serious matter that would typically prompt a diplomatic response from the U.S. government.\n\n3) Option (a) states that the White House said the incident was a provocation and raised objections with Beijing. This is a plausible and likely response from the U.S. government after such an encounter.\n\n4) Option (b) adds an additional detail about raising objections so that \"residents next to the airstrips would hear about its concerns over international airspace.\" This extra detail seems unnecessary and unlikely to be the primary motivation for raising objections with Beijing.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the passage, option (a) \"White House said the incident was a provocation, raised objection with Beijing\" is the more likely response compared to option (b).",

The statement \"One soldier is killed in the gunfight\" suggests that we are dealing with a militant or terrorist group involved in armed conflict.\n\n2. The name \"Boko Haram\" is provided, which means \"Western education is sacrilege.\" This indicates that Boko Haram is an extremist group that opposes Western education and values.\n\n3. The mention of a \"January 2012 militant attack\" that killed 211 people further reinforces the violent and extremist nature of the group.\n\n4. Option (a) suggests that Boko Haram has ties to al Qaeda, which is a well-known international terrorist organization with similar ideologies and tactics.\n\n5. Option (b) proposes that Boko Haram has ties to al Qaeda to adopt new kite-flying techniques as part of their leisure activities. This option seems highly unlikely and inconsistent with the information provided, which portrays Boko Haram as a violent and extremist group.\n\nTherefore, based on the context and the details provided, option (a) \"Group has ties to al Qaeda\" is the more plausible and likely choice, as it aligns with the militant and extremist nature of Boko Haram as described.",

The headline states that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) wants to fire 36 employees in Hawaii, which is believed to be the largest firing in the agency's history.\n\n2. Option (a) suggests that the reason for the firings is related to bags not being properly screened, which is a plausible reason as it directly relates to the core responsibility of the TSA in ensuring proper security screening of baggage.\n\n3. Option (b) suggests that the bags were not properly screened so that the local sports team could win their upcoming game. This reason seems highly implausible and far-fetched, as there is no logical connection between the TSA's security screening procedures and a local sports team's performance.\n\n4. Given that the TSA's primary role is to ensure transportation security, it is more reasonable to assume that the firings are related to a failure in properly carrying out their screening duties, as stated in option (a), rather than the bizarre and unlikely reason given in option (b).\n\nTherefore, based on the available information and logical reasoning, option (a) \"Agency said bags not properly screened\" is the more likely reason behind the firing of the 36 TSA employees in Hawaii.",
