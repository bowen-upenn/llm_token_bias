The journalist admitting to a lapse in moderation judgement regarding the Lewinsky comment is plausible, but adding the personal motive of making a dinner reservation in (b) seems like an unnecessary and implausible extra detail.\n\nSo my step-by-step thinking leads me to conclude that option (a) is more likely in this case.",

However, both options seem somewhat improbable given the extreme violence described. I would need more context to make a completely informed judgment.",
