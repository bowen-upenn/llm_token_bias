It is a plausible explanation for mass firings at an agency responsible for airport security screening.\n\nHowever, the suggestion in option (b) that bags were not properly screened in order to help a local sports team win seems highly improbable and lacks any reasonable motivation or logical connection to the TSA's core mission of aviation security. There is no evident reason why the TSA would compromise security for the sake of a sporting event outcome.\n\nTherefore, the more likely explanation based on the provided information is option (a) that the agency cited improper screening of bags as the reason behind the proposed major firings of TSA employees in Hawaii.",
