By raising objections with Beijing over the Chinese fighter jet's aggressive behavior, the White House would likely aim to reaffirm the U.S. commitment to maintaining freedom of navigation in the region, which is a longstanding strategic interest for the U.S. and its allies.\n\nOption (a) seems incomplete, as it does not provide a clear reason or context for the White House's objection with Beijing, whereas option (b) suggests that the objection is part of a broader strategy to uphold freedom of navigation in the South China Sea.",

President Bush stating \"The United States supports Georgia's territorial integrity\" implies concern over Georgia's ability to maintain its borders and sovereignty.\n\n3. Seeking NATO membership is often driven by a desire for collective defense and deterrence against external threats.\n\nTherefore, Georgia's motivations for wanting to join NATO are more likely related to securing its national boundaries and deterring foreign military threats, rather than just a general ambition to join the alliance.
