By raising objections with Beijing over this \"provocation\", the White House is likely to use this opportunity to reaffirm the U.S. commitment to freedom of navigation in the contested South China Sea waters.

This implies that the celebrity stories resonate with and give a voice to victims of domestic abuse who can then relate their own experiences.\n\nOption (a) omits that crucial connection of people being able to relate the celebrity cases to their own experiences of domestic violence.
