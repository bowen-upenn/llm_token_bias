The conjunction fallacy occurs when people judge a specific condition to be more probable than a general one.\n\nIn this case, option (a) is a general statement about Sebastian Vettel winning the German Grand Prix, while option (b) adds a specific detail about him promoting his new line of sports watches after winning.\n\nSince option (b) includes the condition of option (a) plus an additional condition (promoting sports watches), it is necessarily less probable or equally probable at best compared to option (a).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) because it is the more general and hence more likely statement compared to the conjunction of (a) and the additional condition in (b).",
