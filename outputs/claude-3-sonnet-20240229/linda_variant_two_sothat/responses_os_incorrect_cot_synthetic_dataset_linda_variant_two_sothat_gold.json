This is likely to be seen as a provocative act by the U.S.\n\n2) The passage does not provide any specific details about the White House's response, but it is reasonable to assume that the White House would object to such an aggressive encounter and raise concerns with Beijing.\n\n3) Option (a) simply states that the White House raised an objection with Beijing, which is a likely response but does not provide any additional context.\n\n4) Option (b) includes the additional context that the U.S. would raise objections to emphasize its commitment to maintaining freedom of navigation in the region. This is a plausible motivation for the U.S. to object to the Chinese jet's aggressive behavior, as the U.S. has consistently advocated for freedom of navigation in the South China Sea.\n\n5) Given the geopolitical tensions in the South China Sea and the U.S.'s interest in maintaining freedom of navigation in the region, option (b) provides a more nuanced and likely explanation for the White House's response.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and the broader context of U.S.-China relations in the South China Sea, option (b) is the more likely scenario.",

One soldier was killed in a gunfight.\n2. Boko Haram's name means \"Western education is sacrilege.\"\n3. A January 2012 militant attack killed 211 people.\n4. State Dept (likely referring to the U.S. Department of State)\n\nOption (a): Group has ties to al-Qaeda\nOption (b): Group has ties to al-Qaeda so that they can enhance their capabilities and extend their operations beyond their current area.\n\nStep 1: Identify the group mentioned in the question.\nBased on the information provided, the group in question is Boko Haram, a militant group known for their opposition to Western education and their involvement in attacks, including the one in January 2012 that killed 211 people.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the likelihood of option (a).\nThe statement \"Group has ties to al-Qaeda\" is a broad claim that suggests a connection between Boko Haram and the terrorist organization al-Qaeda. While it is possible for militant groups to have ties or affiliations with larger terrorist organizations, this statement alone does not provide enough context or evidence to determine the likelihood of such a connection.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the likelihood of option (b).\nThe statement \"Group has ties to al-Qaeda so that they can enhance their capabilities and extend their operations beyond their current area\" provides more context and a potential motive for Boko Haram to establish ties with al-Qaeda. By aligning with a larger and more established terrorist organization like al-Qaeda, militant groups like Boko Haram may seek to enhance their capabilities and expand their operations beyond their current areas of influence.\n\nBased on the context provided, which includes information about Boko Haram's involvement in deadly attacks and their ideological opposition to Western education, it is more likely that option (b) is true. Militant groups often seek to strengthen their capabilities and extend their reach through affiliations with larger terrorist organizations.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (b): Group has ties to al-Qaeda so that they can enhance their capabilities and extend their operations beyond their current area.",

However, as an experienced and reputed journalist, it is more plausible that if he did acknowledge a lapse, it would have been with the intention of redirecting the conversation towards more relevant campaign issues, rather than simply admitting to a mistake without any specific purpose.\n\nExperienced debate moderators and journalists are typically trained to maintain control over the discussion and steer it towards substantive matters, especially in high-profile events like presidential debates. Admitting a mistake but using it as a segue to refocus the conversation aligns more with the expected professionalism and moderation skills of a veteran journalist in such a scenario.",

However, the given information does not suggest or support this motive.

Recent release of Charles Manson's prison photo has rekindled interest in the case.\n2. Other members of Manson's \"family\" now shun him.\n3. They (other members) are described as model prisoners.\n4. Susan Atkins, who has brain cancer, has her 18th parole hearing on May 28.\n\nOption (a) simply states that Susan Atkins has her 18th parole hearing on May 28. This fact is directly stated in the passage, making it more likely to be true.\n\nOption (b) adds an additional detail that Susan Atkins is having her 18th parole hearing on May 28 so that she can be released to receive proper medical treatment. This detail is not mentioned in the passage, and it introduces an assumption about the reason for her parole hearing.\n\nBased on the given information, option (a) is more likely to be true because it directly states a fact mentioned in the passage, without making any additional assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (a) Susan Atkins, who has brain cancer, has her 18th parole hearing on May 28.",

While both options suggest an extreme situation, option (b) provides a plausible reason (managing limited food resources) for the difficult choice Haitian mothers might have to make, which aligns with the context of the global food crisis and food shortages.\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is (b): \"Haitian mothers forced to choose which children will live or die so that they can manage the limited food resources available to them.\"",

While it is possible that his contributions as an announcer are significant enough to warrant such recognition, there is no specific information provided to support this level of importance or impact on baseball history.\n\nBased on the given information, Option (a) is more likely because it simply states the possibility of his voice being heard at the Baseball Hall of Fame, without making any assumptions about the reasons or significance behind it.

However, the given information does not mention anything about their sporting endeavors or the need for mutual support.\n\nStep 4: Compare the options.\nBoth options make assumptions that are not supported by the given information. However, option (b) makes an additional assumption about the reason for being Olympians, which is not mentioned in the given information.\n\nBased on the analysis, neither option (a) nor option (b) is more likely than the other because both options lack sufficient supporting information.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that neither option is more likely.",

This would go against the agency's primary mission of ensuring security and could potentially compromise safety.\n\nStep 2: Consider the context and implications of each option.\n\nOption (a): If the agency cited improper screening as the reason for firing employees, it would suggest that the firings were due to performance or misconduct issues.\n\nOption (b): If the agency admitted to instructing employees not to properly screen bags to reduce workload, it would imply a concerning disregard for security protocols and potentially put the agency in a negative light.\n\nBased on the analysis, option (a) \"Agency said bags were not properly screened\" appears to be more likely than option (b) \"Agency said bags were not properly screened so that they could reduce staff workload.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is (a).",
