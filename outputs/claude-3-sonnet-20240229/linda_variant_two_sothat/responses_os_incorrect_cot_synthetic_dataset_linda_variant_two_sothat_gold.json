Given the violent nature and apparent capabilities of the group described, having ties to al-Qaeda is a plausible statement.\n\n4) Option (b) goes further by specifying that the ties to al-Qaeda are specifically \"so that they can enhance their capabilities and extend their operations beyond their current area.\" While this is possible, it makes a more detailed assumption about the group's motivations and strategic goals that is not directly supported by the information given.\n\nTherefore, the more prudent choice based solely on the provided details is option (a) - that the group simply has ties to al-Qaeda, without making the additional assumption about their intentions behind those ties stated in option (b).",

Their role is to facilitate a substantive discussion on key campaign issues and topics of national importance.\n\nWhile it's plausible that the moderator may have missed an opportunity to follow up on the Lewinsky scandal (option a), it seems more likely that if they did \"drop the ball\" on that, it would be with the intentional aim of refocusing on campaign issues (option b). A skilled moderator would likely want to steer things back to more relevant political topics.\n\nSo based on the background of this being an experienced PBS journalist who has moderated many debates, option (b) appears more plausible and likely.

This suggests that people are donating for reasons beyond just helping Zack make potato salad.\n\nStep 2: The creator himself acknowledged that the potato salad might turn out bad since he has never made it before.\n\nStep 3: Option (a) simply states that donations have come from different countries, which is plausible given the viral nature of the campaign.\n\nStep 4: Option (b) implies that people are donating specifically so that Zack can learn to make better potato salad. However, this seems less likely since Zack himself did not present the campaign as a learning opportunity.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, option (a) appears to be more likely. The viral nature of the campaign and the significantly higher amount raised suggest that people are donating for reasons beyond just helping Zack make potato salad, such as supporting a humorous or unconventional idea. Option (b) assumes a specific motivation (helping Zack learn) that is not explicitly stated or implied in the given information.",

The third point about HealthCare.gov having technical issues suggests that state sites may have performed better in comparison.\n\nHowever, the passage does not explicitly state that fewer people reported issues with state sites. It only implies that state sites \"seemingly did better\" than the federal site.\n\nSo while option (a) follows directly from the information given, option (b) goes a step further by claiming fewer reported issues on state sites, which is not clearly supported.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence provided, option (a) is more likely to be correct. It makes the more conservative claim that state sites varied but seemed to outperform the federal site, without quantifying the difference in reported issues.",

Mass firings are typically not used as a way to reduce workload, as it would create staffing shortages and disrupt operations.\n\n5) Therefore, based on the information provided in the headline, the more likely option is (a) - that the agency cited improper bag screening as the reason for terminating the employment of 36 TSA workers in Hawaii.\n\nUnless additional context or information is provided that suggests a different rationale, the breach of security protocols (not properly screening bags) appears to be the more plausible explanation for the large-scale firings mentioned in the headline.",
