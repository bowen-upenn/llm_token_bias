By raising objections with Beijing over this \"dangerous\" incident, the U.S. is likely aiming to assert its position on maintaining freedom of navigation in the disputed South China Sea, which is a vital international waterway. This would be in line with the U.S.'s longstanding policy of advocating for freedom of navigation and overflight in the region.",

Option (b) captures this nuance better.",
