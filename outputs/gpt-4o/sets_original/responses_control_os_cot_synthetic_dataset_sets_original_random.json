A subset of snacks are low in calories. (Only some snacks are low in calories.)\n\nConclusion:\n- Therefore, a subset of crisps are low in calories.\n\nAnalysis:\n1. The first premise establishes that crisps belong to the broader category of snacks.\n2. The second premise states that among all snacks, some are low in calories.\n\nHowever, the second premise does not specify whether any of the low-calorie snacks include crisps. It only tells us that some snacks are low in calories, not specifying which kind. Thus, we cannot logically conclude that some crisps are low in calories solely based on these premises.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically sound.",

The given premises do not provide this direct link; the surge-protected electrical fittings could be items other than outlets (like surge protectors, power strips, etc.).\n\nThus, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises. Hence, the reasoning is not logically sound.",
