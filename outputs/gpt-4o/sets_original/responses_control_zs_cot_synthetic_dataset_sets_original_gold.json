While we know all outlets are part of the group of electrical fittings, we only know that a subset of electrical fittings are surge-protected. However, we don't have explicit information about whether the subset of surge-protected electrical fittings overlaps with the subset of electrical fittings that are outlets. \n\nWithout additional information to connect these subsets, it is not logically sound to conclude that some outlets must be surge-protected. Thus, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises. Therefore, the argument is not logically sound.\n\nSo, the correct answer is: **No**.",
