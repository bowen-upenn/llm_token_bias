However, this is not necessarily the case. \n\nFor instance, the metal office supplies mentioned in Premise 2 could include items like staplers or scissors, but this does not confirm that any paper clips are among these metal items.\n\nTherefore, there is a missing connection needed to logically conclude that some paper clips are included in the subset of metal office supplies.",
