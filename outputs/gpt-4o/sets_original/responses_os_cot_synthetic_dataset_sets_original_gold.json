The rare items could be something entirely different from books.

The conclusion incorrectly assumes that the subset of vehicles with four wheels must overlap with the subset of vehicles that are trains, without any evidence provided for such an overlap.\n\nThe structure of the argument assumes a relationship that is not proven by the premises.
