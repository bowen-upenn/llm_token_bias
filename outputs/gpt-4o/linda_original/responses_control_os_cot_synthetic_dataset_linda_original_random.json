This means that the probability of a conjunction of two events is always less than or equal to the probability of each event occurring individually.\n\n4. **Apply the principle to the options:**\n   - Option (a) represents P(A): Kai being a bookkeeping, accounting, and auditing clerk.\n   - Option (b) represents P(A and B): Kai being a bookkeeping, accounting, and auditing clerk and also enjoying learning calligraphy.\n\nSince P(A and B) is always less than or equal to P(A), the more probable option must be:\n\n(a) Kai is a bookkeeping, accounting, and auditing clerk.\n\nThus, ignoring the narrative context and focusing solely on the probabilistic models, option (a) is more probable than option (b).",
