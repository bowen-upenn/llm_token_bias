There is no information suggesting she is involved in art and design work professionally. Thus, the base rate probability of her being an art and design worker seems low.\n\n2. **Conjunction Fallacy**:\n(a) states only one condition \u2013 Samantha is an art and design worker.\n(b) states two conditions \u2013 Samantha is an art and design worker and enjoys bird watching.\n\nAccording to the principles of probability and specifically the conjunction fallacy, the probability of two events occurring together (in conjunction) is always less than or equal to the probability of either one occurring alone. Adding an extra detail (enjoying bird watching) to Samantha's profile, while it might seem plausible, decreases the overall probability because it introduces another condition that must be met.\n\nGiven that the original profile does not provide explicit information to support that Samantha is an art and design worker or enjoys bird watching, let's use this understanding to deduce the answer.\n\nTherefore, the more probable scenario is:\n(a) Samantha is an art and design worker.",

The probability of both events occurring together is the product of their individual probabilities, making it inherently less likely because it requires two independent conditions to be simultaneously true.\n\n2. **Applying the Information Given**:\n   - From the given description, Morgan is highly analytical, engaged in environmental advocacy, and enjoys activities related to sustainable living and education. However, there is no information provided about Morgan's hobbies outside of these activities, especially about knitting.\n\n3. **Logical Deduction**:\n   - Since knitting colorful scarves is not mentioned as part of their known interests or activities, adding this specific hobby does not increase the likelihood.\n   - On the contrary, by the conjunction rule (probability of conjunction of two events is always less than or equal to the probability of a single event), the probability of Morgan being a top executive alone (option a) is higher than the probability of Morgan being a top executive **and** enjoying knitting colorful scarves (option b).\n\nThus, the more probable option is (a) Morgan is a top executive.",

While Kai\u2019s background and interests are diverse, there is no direct indication of an interest in building model airplanes in the provided description. Since building model airplanes would be introducing an additional and unmentioned aspect to Kai's interests, this makes it less probable.\n   - **Option (b)**: Simply states that Kai is an administrative services manager.

There is no information suggesting Jamie's interest in geocaching.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Option (a) involves a single condition (Jamie being a media and communication worker), which aligns well with the information provided.\n   - Option (b) involves two conditions (Jamie being a media and communication worker and enjoying geocaching), making it less probable since there is no evidence supporting the second condition specifically.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) Jamie is a media and communication worker.",

This means the probability of Morgan being a farmer, rancher, or other agricultural manager is inherently higher than the probability of Morgan both being that and enjoying birdwatching.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: While Morgan's interests might align with birdwatching as a potential hobby, adding this additional detail makes the scenario more specific and thus less probable than the more general statement.\n\nTherefore, the more probable scenario is:\n\n(a) Morgan is a farmer, rancher, or other agricultural manager.",
