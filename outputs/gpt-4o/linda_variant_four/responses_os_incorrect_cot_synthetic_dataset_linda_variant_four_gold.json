Their new material\u2019s release often boosts both album sales and concert attendance.\n\nGiven their established history of charting albums and selling out tours, both scenarios seem extremely unlikely. However, comparing the two, for an album to not chart at all while their tour sells out is extraordinarily improbable given the interconnected nature of album releases and tour promotions.\n\nThus, the more likely scenario (though still highly improbable) of the two is:\n\n(a) The album won't chart in any country.",

He is widely known for his efforts in improving international relations, particularly by fostering ties with Western Europe, the United States, and integrating West Germany into NATO and the European Economic Community. He played a crucial role in Germany's post-war economic recovery, known as the \"Wirtschaftswunder\" or \"economic miracle.\"\n\n- **Evaluating Option (a)**: For Adenauer to fail in improving Germany's international relations contradicts historical events, as improving these relations was one of his significant achievements.\n\n- **Evaluating Option (b)**: This option requires two conditions to be met simultaneously: failing to improve international relations and successfully reviving the domestic economy. While it is conceivable in a hypothetical scenario, the added condition of economic revival makes it more specific and less likely than just failing in international relations alone.\n\n**Likelihood Determination**:\nGiven that option (b) is a conjunction of two specific outcomes, it is inherently less probable than just one simple outcome alone (as listed in option (a)).\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThus, based on how likely these events are independently and when combined, the more likely scenario is:\n(a) He fails to improve Germany's international relations.",

Given their legendary status and the excitement that a reunion would generate, it seems highly improbable that their new album would not chart anywhere in the world.\n\n2. **Touring Success:**\n   - It is reasonable to assume that a Beatles reunion tour would generate massive interest and be extremely popular, selling out multiple stadiums globally.\n\n3. **Mutually Incompatible Conditions:**\n   - Since The Beatles are so well-regarded, it is highly unlikely that their new album would not chart anywhere while their tour achieves massive success. The two scenarios presented in option (b) are mutually incompatible: if the tour sells out multiple stadiums globally, it implies there is significant demand and interest, which would likely translate into strong album sales and chart performance as well.\n\nGiven the above analysis:\n- Option (a) is highly unlikely because any new release from The Beatles would almost certainly chart somewhere given their immense popularity.\n- Option (b) is even less likely because it combines two conditions: the album not charting anywhere and the tour selling out, which doesn't make much logical sense given the band's reputation.\n\nBased on this reasoning, options (a) and (b) are both unlikely, but (a) is slightly simpler and less contradictory.\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is:\n(a) The album does not chart anywhere in the world.",

However, given that Dan Brown has a well-known writing style, it is conceivable that some critics may find his work predictable.\n\n2. **Becoming a bestseller:**\n   - Dan Brown is a highly successful and popular author known for many bestsellers. It\u2019s reasonable to presume that his new book is likely to sell well regardless of specific criticisms.\n\nWhen comparing the two options, we should recognize that option (b) includes the additional condition that the book will become a bestseller.
