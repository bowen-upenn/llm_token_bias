Typically, even well-established bands that might not be topping the charts as frequently as they did in their peak years will still have their music chart in at least some countries due to their fan base and media coverage.\n\n3. **Tour Success**:\n   - The Rolling Stones are known for their highly successful world tours that attract massive audiences globally.\n   - It\u2019s highly plausible that their world tours would sell out major venues, even if their new album did not perform as well.\n\n4. **Comparative Analysis**:\n   - Option (a) suggests a very unlikely scenario where the album doesn't chart anywhere.\n   - Option (b) suggests a combination of two events: the album not charting (same as in option (a)), but also stating that their world tour sells out.\n\nSince option (a) stands alone as very unlikely on its own, and option (b) adds an event (a successful tour) that is quite plausible given the band's history:\n\n**Conclusion**:\nOption (b) is slightly more plausible because it includes the successful tour, which is reasonable for The Rolling Stones, even if we consider the unlikely scenario of the album not charting.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (b) The album won't chart in any country but their world tour sells out all the major venues.",

Option (b) states that the vaccine fails in initial trials but eventually becomes the leading vaccine to combat the pandemic after further development.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n- **Initial Failures in Trials:** Vaccine development is a complex process with a high rate of initial failures. It is common for vaccines to face setbacks in early stages due to various factors such as safety concerns, lack of efficacy, or production issues.\n\n- **Further Development and Success:** While it is possible for a vaccine that initially fails to undergo further development and eventually succeed, this involves additional steps, increased research, time, and resources. Not all vaccines that fail initially get the opportunity or the necessary modifications to succeed in subsequent trials.\n\n**Comparing Likelihood:**\n\n- Option (a) involves only one event: the vaccine failing in initial trials. This is quite common in vaccine development.\n\n- Option (b) involves two sequential events: the vaccine failing initially and then, after further development, becoming the leading vaccine. This scenario requires not only the initial failure but also successful further development, which inherently carries a higher degree of complexity and fewer probabilities.\n\nGiven that compound events (like in option (b)) are generally less likely than single events (like in option (a)), the most likely outcome based on probability is:\n\n(a) The vaccine fails in initial trials.",

Jay-Z is a renowned artist with a track record of successful albums and numerous Grammy nominations. Therefore, the chance of his new album receiving no Grammy nominations is relatively low but possible.\n\n2. **Additional Condition in Option (b)**:\n   - Option (b) introduces an additional condition: not only does the album receive no Grammy nominations, but also one of the songs becomes a number one hit on the Billboard charts. The probability of both of these events occurring together (no Grammy nominations and a number one hit) is lower than the probability of just one event occurring (no Grammy nominations).\n\nIn summary:\n- Option (a) involves only one condition: no Grammy nominations.\n- Option (b) involves two conditions: no Grammy nominations and a number one hit on the Billboard charts.\n\nSince (b) requires two specific conditions to be met simultaneously, it is less likely than (a), which only requires one condition.\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is:\n(a) The album receives no Grammy nominations.",

Given the general public's preferences and interests, a book by him might not appeal to a broad audience; it's less likely to become a general bestseller.\n\n2. **Option (b): The book becomes a bestseller in the United States but is mostly purchased for educational and academic purposes rather than general interest.**\n   - This scenario includes all the conditions of option (a), plus an additional condition: the book's sales are largely for educational and academic purposes. Given Ayatullah Khomeini's significant role in history and his influence on political and religious contexts, it is plausible that his book would be of interest to scholars, students, and academic institutions for these purposes.\n\nThus, when comparing the two options, option (b) includes a more specific context that aligns with realistic buying behavior.

His tenure is notable for the economic recovery known as the \"Wirtschaftswunder\" (economic miracle), significant improvement in international relations, especially with Western countries, and for laying the groundwork for the integration of Germany into the Western bloc during the Cold War.\n\n2. **Option (a)** - He fails to improve Germany's international relations:\n   - **Context**: This scenario suggests a negative outcome for Germany's external diplomatic efforts during Adenauer\u2019s time.\n   \n3. **Option (b)** - He fails to improve Germany's international relations but successfully revives the domestic economy:\n   - **Context**: This scenario combines a failure in international relations with success in economic recovery.\n\n**Analyzing Likelihood**:\n1. Given the historical context, Adenauer is well-known for both reviving the German economy post-WWII and significantly improving international relations. This makes it less likely for him to fail at improving international relations while succeeding in the economy.\n2.

Since both statements include the possibility of John J. Sirica compromising his legal principles, option (b) is more specific by detailing an additional action.\n\nWhen considering the likelihood of these statements, we need to remember the principle that more specific scenarios (\"conjunction fallacy\") are statistically less likely than broader, more general scenarios. Thus, option (a) is more likely because it asserts a simpler and broader claim.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n(a) He compromises his legal principles.",
