Event (b) is essentially Event (a) with one more specific outcome added.\n   - The likelihood of both (a) and an additional condition (DiCaprio winning an award) happening together is less than the likelihood of just (a) happening on its own. This is because (a) can occur without the additional condition, making it broader and more likely than the more specific (b).\n\nTherefore, it is more likely that the movie receives critical backlash and fails at the box office than the movie receiving critical backlash, failing at the box office, and Leonardo DiCaprio winning an award for his performance.\n\nSo, the correct answer is: No, it is not more likely that (b) happens than (a).",

This is because the combined scenario requires multiple specific events to occur in sequence and thus has a lower probability.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Single Event (a)**: Canelo loses his next fight.\n   - This is a straightforward outcome with a certain probability.\n\n2. **Combination of Events (b)**: Canelo loses his next fight and then wins the rematch with a knockout.\n   - This outcome requires two specific events: first, Canelo must lose his next fight, and second, he must win the rematch with a knockout.\n   - The probability of this combined scenario happening is the product of the probabilities of each event occurring separately.\n\nSince the combination of multiple events happening in sequence is less likely than a single event happening, option (a) is more likely than option (b).\nTherefore, the answer is No.",

This is unlikely given his history, but theoretically possible.\n\n3. **Changing views and maintaining popularity**: Option (b) suggests that not only will he change his political views, but he will also continue to have high ratings and a large audience. This combines two unlikely events: first, that Limbaugh would change his views, and second, that he would manage to retain his popularity despite such a significant shift.\n\nSince (b) implies the simultaneous occurrence of two events (one of which is already improbable), the probability of both events happening together is even lower than simply the single event in (a). Hence, (a) is more likely than (b).\n\nThe correct answer is No.",
