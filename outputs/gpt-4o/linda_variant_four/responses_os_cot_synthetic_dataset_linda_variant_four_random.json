Adding a third event (Ethan winning an award) makes option (b) more specific and complex because it requires all three events to happen together.\n\nSince option (b) includes all the events of option (a) plus an additional event (Ethan winning an award), it therefore has a lower probability of occurring compared to option (a), which only requires two events to occur together.\n\nThus, the more likely scenario is (a) The movie receives critical backlash and fails at the box office.",

This is because the conjunction requires both conditions to be true simultaneously, which is less probable than either one alone.\n\n**Step 3: Applying the principle to the options**\n\n- Option (a) requires only one condition to be met, which has a certain level of probability.\n- Option (b) requires both conditions to be met, which means the probability of both happening together is less than or equal to the probability of the single condition in option (a).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven that option (a) is a single condition and option (b) is a combination of two conditions, option (a) is more likely.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **(a) He speaks in favor of modern industrial policies**.",

Depending on various factors such as the global significance of Fernando & Mme Isabella, the nature of the event, and current international news attention spans, this could be more or less likely.\n\n2. **Domestic Support:**\n   - Now, consider the possibility of the event not only receiving no international media coverage but also significantly strengthening their domestic support. Achieving both conditions together is inherently more complex because it adds another layer of specificity to the scenario.\n\n**Probability Logic:**\nAccording to the conjunction rule in probability, the likelihood of two events occurring together (in this case, no international coverage and strengthening of domestic support) is always less than or equal to the likelihood of any one of those events occurring alone.\n\nTherefore, having no international media coverage (a) is a broader statement and thus inherently more likely than having no international media coverage and significantly strengthening their domestic support (b).\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is:\n(a) The event receives no international media coverage.",
