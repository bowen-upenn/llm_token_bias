For (b) to be true, both of these conditions must be met simultaneously.\n\nIn probability theory, the likelihood of two events happening together (a conjunction) is always less than or equal to the likelihood of either event happening alone.

Given China's economic history and current policies, it's quite unlikely that such a drastic shift would occur. China has traditionally maintained significant control over key sectors, balancing market liberalization with state control.\n\n2. **Implementing a completely free-market system but maintaining strong state control over key industries**: This option combines the idea of market liberalization with the continued strong state control over strategic sectors such as energy, telecommunications, and finance. This scenario aligns more closely with China's current and historical economic approach, where reforms and liberalization are accompanied by government oversight and control over key industries.\n\nConsidering these factors, implementing a completely free-market system in China is already a low-probability event (option a). Adding an additional specific condition (maintaining strong state control over key industries) can only decrease the overall probability further. Because of the conjunction fallacy, people may mistakenly believe that the more detailed scenario (b) is more probable because it aligns with their understanding of China's economic policies, but in reality, the probability of both events occurring together is always less than or equal to the probability of the single event.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n(a) He implements a completely free-market system.",
