Various sources indicate that a significant percentage of startups fail within this timeframe due to market competition, financial challenges, or operational difficulties.\n   - The likelihood of failure within the first year is considerable, making this a plausible scenario on its own.\n\n2. **Option (b): The company fails within the first year but he secures significant investment due to his reputation and plans a successful pivot.**\n   - This scenario involves two events: the company failing within the first year (which is likely, as discussed above) and Owen D. Young securing significant investment and planning a successful pivot.\n   - Owen D. Young\u2019s reputation could potentially aid in securing investment even after initial failure, but securing significant investment post-failure adds another layer of complexity and probability.\n   - Planning and executing a successful pivot are additional steps that add further uncertainty.\n\nGiven that (a) involves only one event (the company's failure within the first year) while (b) involves multiple contingent events (failure, securing investment, and a successful pivot), (a) is more likely due to the simplicity and higher probability of a single event occurring compared to a sequence of events.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) The company fails within the first year.",

This is a significant departure from current and historical economic policies, where the state has maintained strong control, especially over key industries such as energy, telecommunications, and finance. Given China's historical approach to maintaining control for stability and strategic reasons, a complete move to free-market practices is highly unlikely.\n\n2. **Scenario (b): Teng Hsiao-Ping implements a completely free-market system but maintains strong state control over key industries.**\n   - While this scenario also suggests a shift towards more free-market practices, it still retains a level of government control over crucial industries. This blend of market freedoms with strategic state control is more aligned with China's gradual approach to economic reforms. It allows for increased efficiency and innovation driven by market forces while ensuring that key sectors remain under governmental oversight to maintain economic stability and national security.\n\nGiven these considerations, scenario (b) is more likely.
