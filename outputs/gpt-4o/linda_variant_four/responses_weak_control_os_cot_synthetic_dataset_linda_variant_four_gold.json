The likelihood of this happening depends solely on the probability of the book failing to achieve bestseller status.\n\n2. **Probability of Statement (b):** This statement asserts two conditions:\n    - The book will not make it to the bestseller list (same as statement (a))\n    - Additionally, the book will be critically acclaimed.\n\nSince (b) includes both conditions from (a) and an additional specific condition (the book being critically acclaimed), (b) describes a narrower and thus less probable scenario than (a).\n\nIn other words, for (b) to be true, both conditions must simultaneously occur, whereas (a) only requires one condition. Therefore, the probability of (b) is inherently lower or at most equal to the probability of (a).\n\nSince the logical conjunction of two independent events (if not causally related) is generally less probable than either event occurring alone, the more likely option is:\n\n(a) His book will not make it to the bestseller list.",
