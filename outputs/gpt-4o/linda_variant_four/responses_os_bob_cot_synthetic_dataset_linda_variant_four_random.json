This makes it a more specific and thus a less probable scenario compared to option (a).\n\n3. **Probability Comparison** - Because option (b) includes all the conditions of option (a) and adds another layer of specificity (breaking a record for stunts), it narrows the scope of outcomes that match this description.\n\nIn summary, because option (a) only requires the movie to fail to make a profit, and option (b) requires the movie to both fail to make a profit and set a record for stunts, option (a) is more likely.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) The movie fails to make a profit.",

This involves two conditions occurring together: the movie must win no awards and also become a box office hit.\n\n2. **Understanding Combined Probabilities**:\n   - For option (b) to be true, both conditions must be satisfied simultaneously. In other words, it's a conjunction of two events.\n   - The probability of two events happening together (option b) is inherently less than or equal to the probability of either event happening on its own (option a). This is because option (b) has additional criteria that must be met compared to option (a).\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since option (a) involves only one condition and option (b) involves two conditions, option (a) is more likely to occur.

The complexity and nature of modern geopolitical issues could pose challenges for him initially.\n\n3. **Adaptability and Expertise:** Given his background in international policy, it is plausible that, despite initial struggles, he could eventually understand and adapt to the new context.
