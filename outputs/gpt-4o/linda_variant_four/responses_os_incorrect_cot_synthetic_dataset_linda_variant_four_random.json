The Catechism of the Catholic Church, especially with recent revisions, expresses strong reservations about it.\n   - Pope Francis, for example, has been very vocal in his opposition to capital punishment, emphasizing the dignity of human life and the importance of mercy.\n\n3. **Analysis of Option (a)**:\n   - This suggests that the encyclical will support capital punishment. Given the trend of the Church's increasing opposition to it, this seems less likely.\n\n4. **Analysis of Option (b)**:\n   - This option suggests that the encyclical will support capital punishment but also emphasize mercy and forgiveness. This requires two components:\n     - Support of capital punishment.\n     - Emphasis on mercy and forgiveness.\n   - Given the strong emphasis on mercy and forgiveness in church teachings, this aspect is likely.\n   - However, supporting capital punishment contradicts recent church trends and the likely stance of current popes.\n\n5. **Combining Both Elements in (b)**:\n   - Because option (b) includes a highly unlikely element (supporting capital punishment), it is less likely overall despite including the likely element of emphasizing mercy and forgiveness.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\nSince option (a) is simpler (supporting capital punishment) without adding another condition, it remains more probable than option (b), simply because adding more specific conditions typically decreases the likelihood.\n\nTherefore, despite both options being unlikely due to current church trends, option (a) is still more likely than option (b). \n\nSo, the answer is:\n(a) The encyclical will support capital punishment.",

Konrad Adenauer, the actual first Chancellor of West Germany after World War II, played a significant role in improving Germany's international standing and reviving the economy.\n\n3. **Failure to Improve International Relations**: If Lukas Adenauer, theoretically, fails to improve Germany's international relations, this would likely have significant negative implications for reviving the domestic economy due to reduced foreign aid, lack of trade partnerships, and limited support for rebuilding efforts.\n\n4. **Failure with Mixed Outcome**: Option (b) suggests that despite failing in one major aspect (international relations), Lukas is successful in another major aspect (domestic economy). In the intertwined economic and diplomatic landscape of post-war Germany, success in reviving the domestic economy without improved international relations would be highly improbable.\n\nGiven these points, we deduce that while both outcomes are unlikely, it is more probable for Lukas to fail in one area rather than achieving success in the domestic economy despite failing in international relations.\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is:\n(a) He fails to improve Germany's international relations.",

This adds an additional specific element to the scenario.\n\n4. **Likelihood Analysis**:\n    - The probability of (a) happening is simply the likelihood that Michael's work in improving interfaith relations is not the focus of his canonization.\n    - The probability of (b) happening is the likelihood that not only his work in improving interfaith relations is not the focus but also specifically that he is celebrated for helping to end Communist rule in Eastern Europe. This makes it a narrower scenario with two conditions needing to be met.\n\nGiven that option (b) requires both conditions to be true while option (a) only requires the first condition, option (a) is more likely by virtue of being less specific and requiring fewer conditions to be met.\n\nThus, the more likely option is:\n(a) He is not recognized for his work in improving interfaith relations.",

Given that John, Paul, George, and Ringo are members of The Beatles, one of the most famous and influential bands in history, it is highly improbable that any new release by them would fail to chart anywhere in the world. Their fan base spans multiple generations, and any new material would likely receive significant attention and sales, making it very unlikely that the album would not chart at all.\n\nNow, let's consider option (b). This option, in addition to the improbable scenario described in (a), adds the condition that their tour sells out multiple stadiums globally. While The Beatles reuniting and touring would almost certainly sell out multiple stadiums due to their immense popularity, the improbability of their album failing to chart anywhere still remains a crucial factor.\n\nGiven that (b) includes all the conditions of (a) plus the additional condition about the tour, and considering that the added condition would likely happen because of their massive popularity, the key improbability remains the album not charting anywhere.\n\nSince option (a) is a simpler scenario without additional conditions, it is inherently more likely than (b).
