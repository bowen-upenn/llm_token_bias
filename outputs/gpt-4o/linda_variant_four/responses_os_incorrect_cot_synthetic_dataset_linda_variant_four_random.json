This approach has been central to China's economic strategy and development over the past few decades.\n\n2. **Key Industries**: In China, key industries such as energy, telecommunications, and finance are typically under strong state control. This is based on the government's emphasis on maintaining stability, security, and strategic interests.\n\n3. **Political Context**: The Chinese government is known for its commitment to maintaining control over its economy and strategic industries. Even as China has increasingly embraced market mechanisms, the state retains a significant role in directing economic activity and policy.\n\nGiven these factors, while a free-market system may be part of economic reforms, it is highly unlikely that it would be \"completely\" free-market without maintaining state control over key industries.

Sirica is known for his role as a judge during the Watergate scandal where he was commended for his integrity and adherence to legal principles.
