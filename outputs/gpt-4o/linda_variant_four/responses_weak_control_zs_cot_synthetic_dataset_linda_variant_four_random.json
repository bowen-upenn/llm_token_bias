This is a straightforward event.\n   - For **scenario (b)**, we must combine the probability of FDR not giving a speech with the additional outcome of his presence having a significant impact on public interest. While it may seem plausible that his presence would indeed increase interest, we are essentially adding a second condition to the original event of FDR not giving a speech.\n\n4. **Final Comparison**:\n   - Since scenario (b) requires both events to occur simultaneously (FDR not giving a speech and his presence increasing interest), it is inherently less likely than scenario (a), which involves only one event.\n\nTherefore, based on the principles of probability and the nature of the conjunction fallacy, the more likely outcome is:\n\n(a) FDR would decide not to give any speech.",

In this case, option (b) is a conjunction of two events: the book does not make the bestseller list and it becomes a must-read in business schools. Option (a) involves only one event: the book does not make the bestseller list.\n\n2. **Probability of Single Events**: A single event (the book not making the bestseller list) will always be at least as probable as any conjunction that includes that event plus another condition. This is because the conjunction (b) requires both conditions to be true simultaneously, while (a) only requires one condition to be true.\n\n3. **Logical Deduction**: If Ethan's book has a certain probability of not making the bestseller list, adding an additional condition (that it becomes a must-read in business schools) can only decrease the overall probability. More conditions make an event less likely to occur, not more.\n\nThus, based on the concept of the conjunction fallacy and logical probability, option (a)\u2014the book won\u2019t make the bestseller lists\u2014is more likely than option (b).",

Therefore, the likelihood of scenario (b) is the probability of Alvarez losing his comeback fight, multiplied by the probability of him winning three subsequent fights.\n\n3. **Comparison**: Scenario (b) describes a more specific combination of events, which includes scenario (a) as its first part.
