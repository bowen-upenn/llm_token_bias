Here, (b) consists of two events happening together, whereas (a) is just one event.\n\n**Step 3: Probabilistic comparison.**\n\nAccording to the rules of probability:\n- P(A) = Probability of implementing a completely free-market system.\n- P(A and B) = Probability of implementing a completely free-market system **and** maintaining strong state control over key industries.\n\nSince a conjunction of events (A and B) cannot be more probable than a single event (A), we must conclude that:\n\n**The probability of (a) is higher than or equal to the probability of (b).**\n\nTherefore, the more likely scenario is:\n\n(a) He implements a completely free-market system.",

        "init_model_answer": "To correctly assess the probabilities given in the question, we need to focus on the rule of conjunction discussed earlier: the probability of a conjunction of two events (both happening) can never exceed the probability of either event happening alone. Let's break it down:\n\n1. Option (a): John J. Sirica compromises his legal principles.\n2. Option (b): John J. Sirica compromises his legal principles but ultimately upholds the integrity of the legal process.\n\nIn option (b), there are two events happening:\n1. John J. Sirica compromises his legal principles.\n2. John J. Sirica ultimately upholds the integrity of the legal process.\n   \nBecause option (b) is a conjunction of two events, the probability of both events occurring together is necessarily lower than or equal to the probability of just one of those events occurring alone (in this case, compromising his legal principles, which is option (a)). Therefore, even without considering any background information about John J. Sirica, we conclude:\n\nOption (a) is more likely than option (b).\n\nThus, the correct choice is:\n(a) He compromises his legal principles.",
