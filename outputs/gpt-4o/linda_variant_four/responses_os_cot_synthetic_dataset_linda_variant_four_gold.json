His policies were known for combining elements of free-market mechanisms with substantial state control.\n   - Deng's approach aimed to modernize China's economy while maintaining the political control of the Communist Party.\n\n2. **Nature of China's Economic Policies**:\n   - Historically and currently, China has adopted a mixed economy model. While market reforms have liberalized many sectors, the state continues to exert significant control over key industries, such as energy, telecommunications, and finance.\n   - The Communist Party has maintained that this hybrid approach helps ensure economic stability, national security, and social harmony.\n\n3. **Feasibility Analysis**:\n   - **Option (a): He implements a completely free-market system.**\n     - This option would indicate a drastic shift away from both Deng Xiaoping's legacy and the current policies of the Chinese government. Given China's emphasis on maintaining control over critical sectors, this is quite unlikely.\n   - **Option (b): He implements a completely free-market system but maintains strong state control over key industries.**\n     - This option aligns more closely with China's historical and current approach to economic management. It reflects a realistic balance between market dynamics and state control.\n\nBased on the above analysis, it is more likely that Teng Hsiao-Ping would implement a free-market system with strong state control over key industries if he were advising on China's economic policies in 2023.\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is (b) He implements a completely free-market system but maintains strong state control over key industries.",
