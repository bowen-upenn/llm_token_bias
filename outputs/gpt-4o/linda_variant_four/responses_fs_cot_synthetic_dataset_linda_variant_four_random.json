FDR decides not to give a speech (as in option (a)).\n2. His mere presence increases public interest in history and its relevance to current issues.\n\nGiven FDR's historical significance and the public's fascination with political history, it's plausible that his resurrection would indeed spark widespread interest, regardless of whether he speaks. Even his decision not to speak could be a powerful statement that draws attention to his legacy and stimulates discussions.\n\nSince option (b) includes the scenario described in option (a) but adds an additional consequential outcome that could reasonably be expected, it is more likely.\n\nThus, after considering the implications, the correct answer is:\n\n(b) FDR would decide not to give any speech but his presence alone would significantly increase public interest in historical political decisions and their impacts on today's issues.",

It\u2019s common for documentaries to receive mixed reviews because different critics and viewers have different tastes and perspectives. Therefore, receiving mixed reviews is a fairly broad and likely outcome.\n2. Adding the additional condition that the documentary \"becomes highly influential in educational contexts\" makes the scenario more specific and less probable than just receiving mixed reviews. This is because, for a documentary to not only receive mixed reviews but also become highly influential in educational contexts, it would need to achieve a certain level of recognition and impact that extends beyond the typical reception.\n  \nConsidering these points, the broader and less specific outcome is more probable.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) The documentary receives mixed reviews.",
