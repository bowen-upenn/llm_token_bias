They have consistently charted with their releases over the decades. The likelihood that their album won't chart in any country is very low.\n\n(b) The album won't chart in any country but their world tour sells out all the major venues.\n- This option is essentially saying that despite the album not charting at all, the band's world tour is still extremely successful. Given the Rolling Stones' immense popularity, it is implausible that their album wouldn't chart anywhere. Additionally, their tours typically do well because of their significant reputation and history, regardless of how well their new album performs.\n\nConsidering the Rolling Stones' historical performance and ongoing popularity, it is highly unlikely that their album won't chart in any country at all. Thus, both scenarios are implausible, but if we had to choose the more likely improbable outcome, it would still be (b) given their strong touring performance history.\n\nSo, step by step analysis indicates:\n- The Rolling Stones have a high likelihood of charting.\n- Their tour success doesn't depend solely on their new album's performance.\n\nHence, the more likely, albeit still unlikely scenario, would be option (b).",

Therefore, it is quite plausible that a new vaccine might fail in initial trials.\n\n2. **Vaccine Fails in Initial Trials but Eventually Becomes Leading Vaccine (Option b)**:\n    - This option includes the initial failure but also adds the condition that the vaccine eventually becomes the leading vaccine after further development. This scenario requires two conditions to be met, each of which has its own probability:\n        - The vaccine fails initially.\n        - Despite the initial failure, it becomes the leading vaccine after further development.\n    - The probability of two conditions both happening is inherently lower than the probability of just one condition happening.\n\nTherefore, the likelihood of (a) is higher because it involves only one condition: the vaccine failing in initial trials. Option (b) involves the same initial failure plus an additional condition of ultimate success, making it less likely overall.\n\nThe answer is (a) The vaccine fails in initial trials.",
