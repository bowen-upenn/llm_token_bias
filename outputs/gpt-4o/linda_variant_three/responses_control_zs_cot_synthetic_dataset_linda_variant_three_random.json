Probability of event A: She has a skin rash.\n2. Probability of event B: She has both a skin rash and a thyroid nodule.\n\nSince having a skin rash is a known common symptom of Chicken pox, it is expected to have a relatively high probability.\n\nHowever, for option (b), to be true, both conditions\u2014having a skin rash and having a thyroid nodule\u2014must simultaneously be true. Therefore, P(b) (having both a skin rash and a thyroid nodule) is the conjunction of two separate events: P(skin rash) and P(thyroid nodule).\n\nSince the probability of both events happening together will always be less than or equal to the probability of each event happening individually, P(b) will be less than or equal to P(a).\n\nThus, based purely on probabilistic reasoning:\n\nOption (a) She has a skin rash. is more likely.",

This is because the conjunction requires both events to occur simultaneously, which is inherently less probable than any one event occurring in isolation.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- **Option (a)** states that Morgan experiences both dehydration and a sudden increase in nail growth rate.\n- **Option (b)** states that Morgan experiences dehydration.\n\nWe need to compare these probabilities:\n\n- The probability of Morgan experiencing dehydration (P(dehydration)).\n- The probability of Morgan experiencing dehydration and also a sudden increase in nail growth rate (P(dehydration and sudden increase in nail growth rate)).\n\nClearly, P(dehydration) is at least as large as P(dehydration and sudden increase in nail growth rate), if not larger. This is because the conjunction (option (a)) involves additional conditions that make it inherently less probable than the single event (option (b)).\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is:\n\n(b) Morgan also experiences dehydration.",
