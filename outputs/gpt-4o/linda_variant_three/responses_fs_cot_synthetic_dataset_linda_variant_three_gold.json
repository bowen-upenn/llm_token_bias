Common symptoms include:\n   - Nausea and vomiting\n   - Yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice)\n   - Fatigue\n   - Abdominal pain\n   - Loss of appetite\n   - Dark urine\n   - Pale stools\n\n2. **Analyzing Each Statement:**\n   - Statement (a): Pat experiences vomiting and yellowing of the eyes. This statement specifies two symptoms.\n   - Statement (b): Pat experiences vomiting. This statement specifies one symptom.\n\n3. **Comparing the Two Statements:**\n   - The likelihood of experiencing vomiting alone (as in statement b) is higher than experiencing vomiting combined with another symptom (as in statement a). This is because the probability of two events (vomiting and yellowing of the eyes) happening together is generally lower than the probability of one event (vomiting) happening alone.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The probability of Pat experiencing just vomiting is higher than the probability of Pat experiencing vomiting along with yellowing of the eyes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (b) Pat experiences vomiting.",

Common symptoms include:\n   - Swelling of the stomach (ascites)\n   - Abdominal pain\n   - Jaundice\n   - Fever\n   - Nausea and vomiting\n\n2. **Option (a)**\n   - She experiences swelling of the stomach and abdominal pain.\n   - This includes both symptoms together.\n\n3. **Option (b)**\n   - She experiences swelling of the stomach.\n   - This includes just one symptom.\n\nWhen considering probabilities, it's essential to recognize that individual symptoms can occur without necessarily presenting together. According to the principle of probability:\n- The likelihood of a single symptom occuring (swelling of the stomach) is higher than the likelihood of two simultaneous symptoms occurring (swelling of the stomach and abdominal pain).\n\nThus, considering that a single symptom is more probable than a specific combination of symptoms, the more likely scenario is:\n\n(b) She experiences swelling of the stomach.",

Option (b) states: Morgan also experiences dehydration.
