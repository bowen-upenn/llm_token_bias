Therefore, it is plausible for someone with acne to also have a skin rash.\n\n2. **Acne, Skin Rash, and Frequent Headaches:**\n   - While acne and skin rash are linked by their nature as skin conditions, frequent headaches are typically unrelated to acne and skin rashes. Frequent headaches can arise from a wide range of causes, including stress, migraines, tension headaches, and other health issues, which don't necessarily correlate with acne or skin rashes.\n\n3. **Probability and Simplicity:**\n   - By the principle of parsimony (or Occam's razor), the simpler explanation that involves fewer assumptions is generally more likely. In this context, having just a skin rash (b) involves fewer new health conditions being assumed than having both a skin rash and frequent headaches (a).\n\nConsidering these points, option (b) is more likely because it involves fewer medical conditions and makes a more straightforward connection between acne and another related skin issue (rash), without adding the unrelated condition of frequent headaches.\n\n**Therefore, the answer is:**\n(b) Alex also experiences skin rash.",

There isn't a direct correlation between chronic migraines and hepatitis C.

This is a serious condition that often results from a burst blood vessel in the brain, leading to internal bleeding and pressure on brain tissues.\n\n2. **Vomiting:**\n   - Vomiting can be a symptom associated with brain hemorrhage. Due to increased intracranial pressure, which affects areas of the brain responsible for nausea, vomiting becomes a possible symptom.\n\n3. **Rash:**\n   - A rash, however, is not commonly associated with brain hemorrhages. Rashes are more commonly linked to infections, allergic reactions, or dermatological conditions.\n\n### Likelihood Comparison:\n\n- Option (b) suggests only vomiting.\n- Option (a) suggests vomiting and a rash.\n\nGiven that a brain hemorrhage can reasonably lead to vomiting due to intracranial pressure, but a rash is not a typical symptom associated with this condition, vomiting alone is much more plausible.\n\nSo, the more likely scenario is:\n(b) They also experience vomiting.",

Gastroenteritis is not directly related to arthritis.\n\n3. **Combined Symptoms**:\n   - **Stiff Neck and Gastroenteritis**: Having both conditions simultaneously would require two separate underlying causes \u2013 arthritis affecting the neck and an infection or other cause for the gastroenteritis. These are two unrelated health issues.\n   - **Stiff Neck Alone**: Having a stiff neck alone is more directly related to arthritis, particularly if it is affecting the cervical spine.\n\n**Logical Conclusion**:\nGiven that arthritis can directly cause joint stiffness and potentially affect the neck area, the addition of a stiff neck is more likely than the combination of a stiff neck and gastroenteritis, which involves an unrelated condition.\n\nTherefore, the more likely scenario is:\n(b) She also experiences a stiff neck.",
