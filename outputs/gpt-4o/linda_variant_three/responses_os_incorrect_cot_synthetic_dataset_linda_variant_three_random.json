Dengue is a viral illness known to cause symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, joint and muscle pain, rash, and mild bleeding (such as nose or gum bleeding, or easy bruising). Common symptoms also include malaise (a general feeling of discomfort, illness, or uneasiness).\n\n2. Toe numbness is not typically a symptom of Dengue. While it's not impossible, it is not one of the standard or most common symptoms associated with the illness.\n\nNow let's analyze the options:\n\n- Option (a) includes malaise and toe numbness.\n- Option (b) includes just malaise.\n\nSince malaise is a common symptom of Dengue and toe numbness is not, option (b) is more likely. Casey's specific identity, age, or descent does not affect the commonality of Dengue symptoms.\n\nThus, the more likely option is (b) Casey experiences malaise.",

This is a direct consequence of the damage to the specific parts of the brain that control motor function.\n  \n- Excessive sneezing is not typically associated with brain hemorrhage or paralysis. Sneezing is usually caused by irritation in the nasal passages, allergies, or infections, which are unrelated to brain hemorrhages.\n\nGiven this information, experiencing weakness on one side of the body is a direct and expected consequence of a brain hemorrhage, while excessive sneezing is unrelated.\n\nTherefore, the correct and more likely answer is:\n\n(b) He experiences weakness of one body side.",
