It is associated with symptoms such as joint pain, stiffness, and reduced mobility. It can affect various joints but commonly impacts areas like the hands, knees, hips, and spine.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate Symptom Specificity\n- (a) Neck pain and photosensitivity: While neck pain could be related to osteoarthritis, photosensitivity (sensitivity to light) is not a typical symptom associated with osteoarthritis. Photosensitivity is often linked to other conditions such as lupus or certain skin disorders.\n- (b) Neck pain: Neck pain can be a symptom of osteoarthritis, as the condition can affect the cervical spine (the neck region).\n\nStep 3: Compare Likelihood\n- Since osteoarthritis commonly involves joint pain and can affect the neck, experiencing neck pain is more directly aligned with the condition.\n- Photosensitivity, being unrelated to osteoarthritis, makes option (a) less likely.\n\nConclusion:\n(b) Morgan experiences neck pain.\nThis option is more likely because neck pain is consistent with osteoarthritis symptoms, whereas photosensitivity is not typically associated with osteoarthritis.",

Hyperthyroidism is a condition where the thyroid gland is overactive and produces excessive amounts of thyroid hormone.\n\n2. **Common Symptoms of Hyperthyroidism**: Common symptoms of hyperthyroidism include fatigue, weight loss, rapid or irregular heartbeat, nervousness, irritability, tremors, sweating, and difficulty sleeping.\n\n3. **Comparing Symptoms**:\n   - **Fatigue**: Fatigue is a very common symptom associated with hyperthyroidism. It is experienced because the overactive thyroid can lead to the body's metabolism working too quickly, which can exhaust the body.\n   - **Ankle Swelling**: While ankle swelling can occur with various health issues, it is not a primary symptom of hyperthyroidism. Ankle swelling is more commonly associated with conditions like heart failure, kidney disease, or localized injuries.\n\nGiven that fatigue is a direct and common symptom of hyperthyroidism, it is more likely that she experiences fatigue compared to ankle swelling, which is not specifically associated with hyperthyroidism.\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is (b) She also experiences fatigue.",

Migraines are a type of headache, often characterized by severe pain, nausea, or sensitivity to light and sound. Therefore, experiencing headaches as a symptom is directly related and highly common.\n\nNow let's consider the options:\n(a) He also experiences headaches and nasal congestion.\n(b) He also experiences headaches.\n\n- Option (a) adds nasal congestion into the mix. While it is not uncommon for people to experience nasal congestion, it is not as directly related to migraines as headaches are.\n- Option (b) only mentions headaches, which is more directly and commonly associated with migraines.\n\nGiven that headaches are an inherent part of migraines and adding additional symptoms like nasal congestion makes it more specific and less directly linked to migraines:\n\nThe more likely option is (b) He also experiences headaches.",

Individuals with migraines are at an increased risk of experiencing depression compared to the general population.\n\n2. **Prevalence of Tinnitus with Migraine and Depression**: Tinnitus (ringing in the ears) is less commonly associated with migraines compared to depression. While it can occur, it is not as highly prevalent as depression in migraine sufferers.\n\n3. **Intersection of Three Conditions**: Option (a) suggests the presence of three conditions: migraine, depression, and tinnitus. It is less likely for John to have all three conditions simultaneously because the probability of all three occurring together is lower than the probability of any two of them occurring together.\n\n4. **Simpler Comorbidity**: Option (b) only involves two conditions: migraine and depression. Statistically, it's more probable for someone to have two specific comorbid conditions rather than three.\n\nGiven these considerations, the more likely scenario is:\n\n(b) He also experiences depression.",

This is a well-documented and recognized symptom associated with the disease.\n\n3. **Tinnitus**: Tinnitus, which is a ringing or buzzing in the ears, is not a common or characteristic symptom of Dengue. While certain illnesses can cause tinnitus, it is not directly associated with Dengue as a primary symptom.\n\n4. **Comparing Likelihoods**: Since red spots (rash) are a well-known, common symptom of Dengue and tinnitus is not, it is more probable for the woman to experience just the red spots as a symptom of Dengue rather than both red spots and the less common symptom of tinnitus.\n\nTherefore, the more likely situation is:\n(b) She experiences red spots over her body.",

One common symptom of a brain hemorrhage is hemiparesis, which is weakness on one side of the body.\n\n2. **Weakness of one body side (hemiparesis)**: This is a direct and common result of a brain hemorrhage. It matches well with the known outcome of such a medical condition.\n\n3. **Excessive sneezing**: This symptom is less directly associated with a brain hemorrhage. While sneezing can be caused by various factors, it is not a typical symptom of a brain hemorrhage.\n\nGiven the specificity of the conditions related to a brain hemorrhage, we should select the option that focuses on the most likely and direct result of this medical issue. \n\nSo, the more likely option is:\n(b) He experiences weakness of one body side.",

Option (a) states she experiences two symptoms: swelling of the stomach and difficulty speaking.\n3.

The more conditions we add, the less likely it becomes that all conditions are simultaneously true.\n\nGiven that alcoholic hepatitis can indeed lead to swelling of the stomach (ascites), and that adding another symptom (difficulty speaking) makes it less probable:\n\nThe more likely option is:\n(b) She also experiences swelling of the stomach.",
