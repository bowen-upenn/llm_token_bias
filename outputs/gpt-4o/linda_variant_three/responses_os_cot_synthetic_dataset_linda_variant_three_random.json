GERD is a chronic condition where stomach acid frequently flows back into the esophagus, leading to potential symptoms such as heartburn, chest pain, and regurgitation.\n\n2. **Option (a)**: Pat experiences chest pain and photophobia.\n   - **Chest Pain**: GERD commonly causes chest pain due to the acid reflux.\n   - **Photophobia**: This refers to sensitivity to light, which is not typically associated with GERD. Photophobia is more commonly linked to conditions affecting the eyes or brain, such as migraine or meningitis.\n\n3. **Option (b)**: Pat experiences chest pain.\n   - **Chest Pain**: As mentioned earlier, chest pain is a common symptom of GERD.\n\n### Analysis\n- **GERD and Chest Pain**: The connection between GERD and chest pain is direct and well-documented.\n- **GERD and Photophobia**: There is no direct medical link between GERD and photophobia. The occurrence of both chest pain and photophobia together is less likely because photophobia is generally not related to GERD.\n\n### Conclusion\nConsidering the information above and the principles of probability, it is more likely for Pat to experience chest pain alone rather than chest pain coupled with an unrelated symptom like photophobia.
