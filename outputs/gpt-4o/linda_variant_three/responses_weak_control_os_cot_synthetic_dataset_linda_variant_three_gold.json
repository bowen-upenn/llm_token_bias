One of the common symptoms of hepatitis, including Hepatitis E, is jaundice, which results in yellowish skin and eyes due to increased bilirubin levels in the blood.\n   - Given that jaundice is a common and relatively less severe symptom of Hepatitis E, it is quite probable that a person with Hepatitis E will experience yellowish skin.\n\n2. **Yellowish Skin and Coma**:\n   - While jaundice is common, a coma is a severe and rare complication. A coma would typically result from severe liver failure or other critical conditions, which are much less frequent.\n   - The probability of experiencing both yellowish skin **and** a coma is inherently lower than experiencing just yellowish skin because it combines two specific conditions.\n\nGiven that having yellowish skin alone is more common and likely than having yellowish skin combined with the severe complication of a coma, the more probable scenario is:\n\n(a) He experiences yellowish skin.",
