Common symptoms include jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), itching, dark urine, light stools, and potentially loss of appetite due to the digestive issues and general malaise associated with the condition.\n\n2. **Symptoms Analysis**:\n   - **Loss of appetite**: This is a common symptom in many liver conditions, including chronic cholestasis. Digestive issues and general discomfort can lead to a decreased desire to eat.\n   - **Frequent headaches**: While headaches can occur for various reasons and may be experienced by individuals with chronic illnesses, they are not specifically noted as common symptoms of chronic cholestasis.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options based on the likelihood of the symptoms:\n\n- **Option (a)**: He experiences loss of appetite and frequent headaches.

Here are the steps for this decision:\n\n1. **Migraine and Depression**: There is a well-documented link between migraines and depression. Research shows that individuals who suffer from migraines are more likely to also experience depression.\n\n2. **Migraine and Tinnitus**: Tinnitus, which is the perception of noise or ringing in the ears, can also co-occur with migraines, but the linkage is less documented and presumably less common than the link between migraines and depression.\n\n3. **Combined Conditions**: When considering the likelihood of experiencing both depression and tinnitus alongside migraines, the probability decreases because we are looking for the co-occurrence of three conditions rather than two. The conjunction fallacy, in which people think that more specific conditions are more probable than a general one, should be avoided.\n\nBased on this reasoning, since the occurrence of just migraines and depression together is more common and straightforward compared to the triple occurrence that includes tinnitus, the more likely option is:\n\n(b) He also experiences depression.",
