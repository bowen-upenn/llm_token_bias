Bile is a digestive fluid produced by the liver. This condition can lead to several symptoms, including:\n   - Fatigue\n   - Itching (pruritus)\n   - Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)\n   - Abdominal pain\n   - Loss of appetite\n   - Nausea\n   - Dark urine\n   - Pale stools\n\n2. Given that loss of appetite and abdominal pain are both common symptoms of chronic cholestasis, the possibility of John experiencing loss of appetite alone is encapsulated within the broader possibility of experiencing both symptoms. In logical terms, experiencing just loss of appetite is a subset of experiencing both symptoms.\n\n3. In probability terms, experiencing multiple specific symptoms together (like both loss of appetite and abdominal pain) is less likely than experiencing just one of those symptoms. Therefore, while both could occur, experiencing just the loss of appetite is more likely because it requires only one condition to be true.\n\nTherefore, the step-by-step reasoning leads to the conclusion that the more likely option is:\n(b) He experiences loss of appetite.",
