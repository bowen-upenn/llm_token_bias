It can also affect menstrual cycles in women of reproductive age, leading to unusual menstruation patterns.\n   \n2. **Considering Sunita\u2019s Characteristics:**\n   - **Age:** Sunita is 65 years old, which generally means she is likely to have gone through menopause, during which menstruation naturally stops. Therefore, abnormal menstruation is less likely for her, but not impossible, especially if the condition was present earlier.\n   \n   - **Gender:** As a woman, she may have experienced menstrual-related symptoms in the past if hyperthyroidism developed when she was still menstruating. However, the specifics given suggest that she is currently 65.\n\n3. **Evaluating the Options:**\n   - **Option (a):** States that Sunita experiences both abnormal menstruation and muscle weakness.\n   - **Option (b):** States that Sunita experiences only abnormal menstruation.\n\nGiven Sunita's age (65) and the fact that she is likely post-menopausal, experiencing muscle weakness appears more probable than experiencing abnormal menstruation.

While a stiff neck can sometimes accompany headaches or migraines, it is not as consistently present as the headache itself.\n\nSince option (b) includes just the headache without the additional condition of a stiff neck, it is the simpler and more direct statement, and therefore more likely.\n\nThe correct answer is (b) He also experiences a headache.",

Hence, it is quite common for patients with Dengue to have red spots.\n   - **Chills**: While fever is a major symptom of Dengue, it is not explicitly characterized by chills. People may experience a sensation of feeling very hot and then cold, but chills are not a defining symptom of Dengue.\n   - Combining these two observations: While chills can occur in various fevers, they are not as characteristic or definitive for Dengue as the red spots.\n\n3. **Comparing Options**:\n   - **Option (a)**: She has red spots over her body and chills. This means she has two symptoms: one that is common (red spots) and one that may occur but is not as definitive (chills).\n   - **Option (b)**: She has red spots over her body. This means she has one common symptom which is directly linked to Dengue.\n\n4. **Law of Probability**: \n   - Given a single condition (Dengue diagnosis) the chance of having one of its common symptoms (red spots) is higher than the chance of having the red spots plus another symptom (chills).\n   - This is aligned with the conjunction fallacy, where the probability of a single event (red spots) is higher than the probability of two combined events (red spots and chills).\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is:\n\n(b) She also has red spots over her body.",
