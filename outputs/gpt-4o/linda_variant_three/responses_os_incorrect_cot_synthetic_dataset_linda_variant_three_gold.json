However, the question asks which one is more likely, and we're given two options:\n(a) Loss of appetite and abdominal pain.\n(b) Loss of appetite.\n\nSince 'loss of appetite' is listed in both options, we should consider the additional symptom of 'abdominal pain' from option (a). While abdominal pain is a symptom, it is slightly less common than loss of appetite in many patients.\n\nTherefore, it's more likely that a patient will experience loss of appetite alone rather than both loss of appetite and abdominal pain.

Chills typically occur in response to a fever or an external cold environment, often accompanied by shivering.\n\n3. **Analyzing Option (b)**:\n   - Hiroshi experiences shivering.\n   - This option involves only one symptom: shivering. Shivering can occur for several reasons, like feeling cold or due to other medical conditions, but it is a more general and less specific symptom than having chills.\n\n4. **Considering probability and simplicity**:\n   - Since (a) includes both shivering and chills, it is a more specific combination of symptoms.\n   - (b) involves only shivering, making it a less complex and more probable occurrence if we aren't given further information implying more severe symptoms.\n\nGiven these considerations, the simpler and more likely scenario based solely on Hiroshi having an allergy would be:\n\n(b) He also experiences shivering.",

While both symptoms are related to bronchial asthma, this combination requires both to be present simultaneously, which is generally less likely than the occurrence of either symptom alone.\n\nSince all individuals who experience fatigue might not necessarily produce mucoid sputum at the same time, and adding an extra condition makes the scenario more specific and thus less likely, the simpler option is usually more probable.\n\nTherefore, the more likely scenario is:\n\n(b) Bob works for a renewable energy company.",
