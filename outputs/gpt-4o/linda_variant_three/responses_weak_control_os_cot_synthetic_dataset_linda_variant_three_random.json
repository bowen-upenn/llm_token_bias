Fatigue is indeed a common symptom of hyperthyroidism. Swelling of the ankles is less commonly directly associated with hyperthyroidism but can occur due to other complications or conditions.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Options Individually**:\n   - **Option (a)** includes both \"fatigue\" and \"ankle swelling\".\n   - **Option (b)** only includes \"fatigue\".\n\n3. **Evaluating the Probability**:\n   - Option (b) states a single condition, \"fatigue\", which is a common symptom of hyperthyroidism.\n   - Option (a) states two conditions, \"fatigue\" and \"ankle swelling\". For this conjunction of events to be true, both \"fatigue\" and \"ankle swelling\" must be present simultaneously.\n\n4. **Conjunction Fallacy**: According to probability theory, the probability of two events occurring together (in conjunction) is always less than or equal to the probability of either one occurring alone. Hence:\n   - The probability of \"fatigue\" alone (option (b)) is higher than the probability of both \"fatigue and ankle swelling\" occurring together (option (a)).\n\nBased on the reasoning above, the more probable option is:\n\n(b) She also experiences fatigue.",

Common symptoms can include headaches, dizziness, and nausea among others.\n\n2. **Probability of Individual Symptoms:**\n   - Let's consider the probability of experiencing headaches due to hypertension. Headaches are a relatively common symptom and are likely to happen.\n   - Nausea is less common than headaches but can also be a symptom of hypertension.\n\n3. **Combining Symptoms:**\n   - For a person to experience both headaches and nausea, both events must occur simultaneously. The probability of two independent events (headaches and nausea) happening together is always less than or equal to the probability of each event happening alone.\n\nGiven this, the probability of experiencing just headaches (which is a single event) is greater than the probability of experiencing both headaches and nausea (which requires two events to occur together). \n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n(b) She experiences headaches.",
