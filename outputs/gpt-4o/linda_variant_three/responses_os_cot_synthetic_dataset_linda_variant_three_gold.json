It is a relatively nonspecific symptom but can occur frequently across different stages of the disease.\n\n2. **Yellowing of the eyes (jaundice)**: Jaundice is a more specific symptom related to liver conditions, such as hepatitis A. While jaundice is a hallmark symptom of hepatitis A, its presence requires the disease to have progressed to a certain extent. \n\nSo, let's evaluate:\n\n- **Option (a)**: Pat experiences both vomiting and yellowing of the eyes. For this to occur, Pat must have progressed hepatitis A that includes jaundice, which makes it a combined condition.\n  \n- **Option (b)**: Pat experiences vomiting. This condition alone is more general and can occur in various stages and types of illnesses, including the early or more widespread stage of hepatitis A.\n\nGiven that vomiting can happen across a broader range of cases and conditions (including early stages of hepatitis A without jaundice), it is statistically more likely than the more specific combined condition (vomiting plus jaundice).\n\nTherefore, the more likely scenario is:\n\n(b) Pat experiences vomiting.",
