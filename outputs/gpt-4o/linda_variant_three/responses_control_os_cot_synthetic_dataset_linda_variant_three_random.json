Let's analyze each option:\n\n(a) Taylor experiences frequent headaches.\n(b) Taylor experiences frequent headaches and has a strong dislike for cilantro.\n\nStep-by-Step Analysis:\n1. **Proposition (a):** Taylor experiences frequent headaches. This is a single event.\n2. **Proposition (b):** Taylor experiences frequent headaches and has a strong dislike for cilantro. This is a conjunction of two events: experiencing frequent headaches and disliking cilantro.\n\nAccording to the rules of probability:\n- The probability of a single event happening is always higher or equal to the probability of that event occurring together with another specific event.\n- Therefore, the likelihood of Taylor experiencing frequent headaches alone is always higher than the combined likelihood of experiencing frequent headaches and disliking cilantro.\n\nEven though we know that Taylor recently suffered from paralysis due to a brain hemorrhage (which might be related to experiencing frequent headaches), the dislike for cilantro adds an additional condition that reduces the probability.\n\nThus, the option with the higher likelihood is:\n\n(a) Taylor experiences frequent headaches.",

Thus, this scenario is plausible and represents the occurrence of two related health conditions.\n\n- **Hepatitis E, yellowish skin, and frequent headaches (a combination of multiple symptoms)**: This scenario includes everything in option (a) plus an additional condition (frequent headaches). This is a conjunction of Hepatitis E, yellowish skin, and frequent headaches.\n\nStatistically, the conjunction of multiple events is less probable than the occurrence of any single event or a lesser number of events.
