Therefore, the probability of vomiting during a heart attack is lower than the probability of sweating.\n\nNow, let's examine the two options:\n\n(a) They experience sweating and vomiting.\n(b) They experience sweating.\n\nThe key here is that option (a) is a combination of two events: sweating *and* vomiting, whereas option (b) involves just one event: sweating.\n\nWhen we calculate the probability of two events happening together (sweating and vomiting), it will always be less than or equal to the probability of just one of those events happening alone (sweating in this case).

It can lead to several symptoms including swelling of the stomach (due to fluid accumulation or ascites) and abdominal pain.\n\n2. **Understanding Probability**: \n   - When assessing the likelihood of multiple symptoms occurring together versus one symptom alone, the principle of probability states that the occurrence of two events together (swelling of the stomach and abdominal pain) is always less likely than either event occurring alone.\n   - In other words, an individual experiencing just swelling of the stomach must logically be more common than an individual experiencing both swelling of the stomach and abdominal pain simultaneously.\n\nTherefore, option (b) \"She experiences swelling of the stomach\" is the more likely scenario. This is because swelling of the stomach is a single event, whereas experiencing both swelling and pain involves the conjunction of two events, which statistically reduces the likelihood compared to either event occurring alone. \n\nIn summary:\n(b) She experiences swelling of the stomach.",

Common symptoms include fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance (hence cold hands and feet), and various other metabolic slowdowns.\n\n2. **Evaluating option (a):** \"He experiences cold hands and feet.\" This is a direct and common symptom of hypothyroidism, and therefore, it has a high likelihood of being true given the condition.\n\n3. **Evaluating option (b):** \"He experiences cold hands and feet and has brittle nails.\" This option includes an additional detail beyond experiencing cold hands and feet. Brittle nails can also be a symptom of hypothyroidism, but the likelihood of both symptoms occurring together must be considered.\n\n**Considering probabilities:**\n\n- The probability of experiencing cold hands and feet is represented by P(A).\n- The probability of experiencing both cold hands and feet and brittle nails can be represented as P(A and B).\n\nAccording to the principles of probability, P(A and B) (two events occurring together) is always less than or equal to P(A) (a single event occurring). This is because for both A and B to occur, the more general condition A must occur, and an additional condition B must also be met.\n\nTherefore, the correct selection is:\n\n(a) He experiences cold hands and feet.",

In this case, adding extra conditions can make it seem more specific but actually less likely when considering probability.\n\n- **Probability Basics:**\n  If Event A (dehydration) and Event B (sunken eyes) are both potential symptoms, then:\n  - P(A and B) \u2264 P(A)\n  - This means the probability of both dehydration and sunken eyes occurring (a conjunction of both symptoms) cannot be higher than the probability of just dehydration occurring.\n\n**Specific to the options provided:**\n- **Option (a)** asks us to consider the likelihood of both dehydration and sunken eyes occurring.\n- **Option (b)** involves just dehydration occurring.\n\nSince dehydration (option b) does not need the additional condition of sunken eyes, it is inherently more likely because it covers all instances where Morgan experiences dehydration, whether or not sunken eyes are present.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOption (b) is more likely because it is a broader condition that is not restricted by an additional symptom like sunken eyes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(b) Morgan also experiences dehydration.",
