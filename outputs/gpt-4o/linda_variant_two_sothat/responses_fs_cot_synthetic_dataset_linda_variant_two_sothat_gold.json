The jet made several dangerous passes and came very close to the U.S. plane, indicating a tense and potentially provocative situation.\n\n2. **Immediate Response**:\n    - (a) The White House said the incident was a provocation, raised objection with Beijing.\n    - (b) The White House said the incident was a provocation, raised objection with Beijing so that the U.S. could emphasize its commitment to maintaining freedom of navigation in the region.\n\n3. **Likelihood Analysis**:\n    - (a) This option states a straightforward response from the White House, indicating that the U.S. considered the incident a provocation and raised objections with Beijing. Such a response is typical in diplomatic and military affairs.\n    - (b) This option contains additional information: the U.S. raised objections to emphasize its commitment to maintaining freedom of navigation. While this reasoning is plausible and aligns with U.S. policy in the South China Sea, the extra detail provided about the motivation makes this option slightly more specific and complex.\n\nGiven these steps, (a) is more likely because it presents a direct and general response. Option (b) adds a layer of reasoning that, while reasonable, is not necessarily required to establish the likelihood of the basic diplomatic response.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) White House said the incident was a provocation, raised objection with Beijing.",

This part of the statement is common to both options and therefore does not affect the relative probability.\n\n2. **Returning to Duty**:\n   - Option (b) adds additional detail by specifying that he will return to duty within a few months. This added detail makes option (b) more specific and thus less likely because it requires two conditions to be true: (1) he makes a full recovery, and (2) he returns to duty within a specified timeframe.\n\nIn probability, the likelihood of two conditions being true simultaneously is lower than the likelihood of just one of those conditions being true. Hence:\n\n- Option (a) involves only one condition: that he makes a full recovery.\n- Option (b) involves two conditions: that he makes a full recovery and that he returns to duty within a few months.\n\nGiven this analysis, the more likely option is (a) Officer Kevin Brennan, 29, expected to make full recovery after surgeons remove bullet from skull.",

Both options acknowledge this point.\n\n2. **General reasons for owning a flip phone:**\n    - Option (a) suggests there are reasons to own a flip phone but doesn't specify what those reasons might be.\n    - Option (b) specifies that the reason could be seeking a simpler, distraction-free phone experience.\n\n3. **Specificity:** \n    - Option (a) is a broader, more general statement. It simply states that there are reasons to own a flip phone without providing details.\n    - Option (b) gives a specific and plausible reason (simpler, distraction-free experience), which is consistent with some people's choice to use flip phones over smartphones.\n\nGiven the information we have, while both options suggest Jerry Jones has reasons to own a flip phone, Option (b) provides a plausible and commonly cited reason which gives it more specificity and likelihood.\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is (b) Price isn't much of a factor, but there are still reasons to own a flip phone so that he can have a simpler, distraction-free phone experience.",

Introducing more specific conditions (the peace process leading up to democratic elections) makes option (b) less likely simply due to its additional complexity and specificity.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven that the basic information is contained in both options but option (b) adds a specific consequence that is a more complex situation, the simpler statement (a) is more likely to be accurate.\n\nThe correct answer is (a): A decade-long conflict between Maoist insurgents and state forces killed at least 13,000.",
