The journalist has a strong professional background:\n   - Moderated 11 previous debates.\n   - Wrote a book on the history of televised presidential debates.\n   - The extensive experience suggests a high level of professionalism and commitment to their role.\n\n2. Personal life information:\n   - Married for 52 years, indicating stability and a long-term commitment.\n   - Has a family with three daughters and six grandchildren, which might suggest a responsible and ethical demeanor.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\n(a) Admitted dropping the ball when Clinton talked about Monica Lewinsky.\n   - This option suggests the journalist acknowledges making a mistake during a debate. Admitting mistakes is a common human behavior, particularly for a seasoned professional who might understand the importance of transparency and learning from errors.\n\n(b) Admitted dropping the ball when Clinton talked about Monica Lewinsky so that he could catch an early dinner reservation later that evening.\n   - This suggests that the mistake was admitted and attributed to a trivial reason (a dinner reservation), which seems less professional and likely inconsistent with the journalist\u2019s long-standing career and commitment to public service.\n\nGiven the journalist's distinguished career and evident dedication to their professional responsibilities, it seems far less likely that they would prioritize a dinner reservation over the integrity of moderating a presidential debate.\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is:\n(a) Admitted dropping the ball when Clinton talked about Monica Lewinsky.",

The opposition insists that the power-sharing deal must give it genuine power to deliver change.\n2. Zimbabwe's President Mugabe is scheduled to hold talks with Morgan Tsvangirai.\n3. Mugabe indicates that these talks are the last chance for the opposition before he forms a government.\n\nConsidering these details, we can infer:\n- There is urgency and a critical nature to the talks, suggesting ongoing political negotiations and potential deadlock.\n- Mugabe's mention of a \"last chance\" implies that there have been difficulties and deadlocks in the negotiations previously.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n(a) Power-sharing deal signed by pair has been deadlocked since September.\n(b) Power-sharing deal signed by pair has been deadlocked since September so that they can announce it during the local spring festival.\n\nOption (a) suggests that the power-sharing deal has been stuck in a deadlock since September, which aligns well with the urgency and critical nature of the talks.\n\nOption (b) adds an additional motive related to a local spring festival. There is no information provided to suggest that the timing of the announcement is linked to a festival, and such timing seems less relevant given the urgency expressed.\n\nTherefore, the information supports option (a) more strongly.\n\nThe correct answer is (a) Power-sharing deal signed by pair has been deadlocked since September.",

We are looking at the implications of the U.S. managing the situation.\n2. The main focus so far has been on political and military aspects (e.g., \"bilateral relations\" and \"military action in Gaza\").\n3. Therefore, the primary concern would be containing political and military ramifications rather than tourism.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nOption (a) is more likely because it directly addresses the regional implications that are of primary concern in the given context.\n\nThus, the correct answer is (a) manages the situation, then regional implications can be contained.",
