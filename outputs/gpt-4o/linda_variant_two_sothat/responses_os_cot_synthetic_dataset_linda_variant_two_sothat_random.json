        "init_model_answer": "To determine which option is more likely, let's analyze the given information logically.\n\n1. The Pentagon described the incident as \"dangerous\" and mentioned that the Chinese jet came within 20 feet of the Navy patrol plane. This indicates that the U.S. government views the incident seriously and would likely respond through official diplomatic channels.\n\n2. Given the seriousness of the incident, it is reasonable to assume that the White House would characterize it as a provocation and raise an objection with Beijing. This fits the pattern of standard diplomatic response to such potentially hostile encounters.\n\n3. Option (b) suggests an additional specific motive: to inform residents next to the airstrips about the concerns over international airspace. This detail seems unnecessary and less plausible as a primary motive for diplomatic action. Diplomatic objections are typically made in the interest of national security and international norms, not for the purpose of informing residents near military installations.\n\nTaking these points into consideration, it is clear that option (a) is more likely because it describes a straightforward and plausible diplomatic response without introducing an unlikely secondary motivation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a).",

It provides a straightforward fact without any further context or reasoning.\n\n**Option (b)**: This option adds a specific motivation for why Robert was in Hooters\u2014to watch a football game on the big screen TVs.\n\nGiven that we already know he was found in Hooters hours after the incident, the likelihood does not change regardless of the specific reason stated in option (b). Adding additional information about his motive (watching a football game) makes the scenario more specific, thus less probable compared to the more general statement in option (a).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n(a) Was found in Hooters hours later.",
