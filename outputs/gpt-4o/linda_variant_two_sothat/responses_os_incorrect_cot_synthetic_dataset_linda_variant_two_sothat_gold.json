International organizations are calling for an end to the fighting, and the U.S. President has expressed support for Georgia's territorial integrity.\n   - **Key Point:** This situation suggests Georgia is in a precarious security situation.\n\n2. **Option Analysis:**\n   - **Option (a):** Georgia has ambitions of joining NATO.\n     - **Likelihood:** Given Georgia's history and recent conflicts, it is very plausible that the country seeks NATO membership as a way to align with Western military powers and receive security assurances.\n\n   - **Option (b):** Georgia has ambitions of joining NATO to better secure its national boundaries and deter foreign military threats.\n     - **Likelihood:** This option adds a specific rationale for NATO membership, which fits well with the details in the context. Since securing national boundaries and deterring foreign threats are common motivations for countries seeking NATO membership, this is a likely consideration. However, it is a more detailed statement than option (a).\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - **More Likely Option:** While both options are plausible, (a) is more general and hence more likely because it encompasses the general motivation without adding specific details that might not be explicitly stated in the text. The principle of Occam's razor (favoring simpler explanations when multiple plausible ones exist) supports choosing the more general option.\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is (a) Georgia, formerly part of the Soviet Union, now has ambitions of joining NATO.",

This indicates significant concerns around the welfare of horses within the racing industry.\n\n2. **Identifying general vs. specific claims**:\n   - **Option (a)** is a general claim that animal welfare activists are pushing for federal regulation of the horse racing industry. This could encompass a wide range of regulatory efforts aimed at improving horse welfare in various aspects.\n   - **Option (b)** is a more specific claim, suggesting that activists are pushing for federal regulation with a particular focus on ensuring that horses do not end up in slaughterhouses after their racing careers.\n\n3. **Likelihood of broader vs. specific claims**:\n   - Generally, broader claims are more likely because they encompass a wider range of motivations and actions. A push for overall federal regulation could address multiple concerns, such as safety during races, proper retirement for horses, humane treatment, etc.\n   - Specific claims, while plausible, are less likely on their own unless there is strong evidence pointing towards that exact initiative.\n\n4. **Evaluation of given information**: The problem emphasizes the fate of horses that either die or face grim futures after their racing careers. While this could lead activists to focus on the issue of preventing horses from going to slaughterhouses, it is also reasonable to assume they would advocate for broader regulations that include but are not limited to this issue.\n\nBased on the principle that broader claims generally cover more possible initiatives and are thus more likely:\n\nThe more likely option is:\n(a) Animal welfare activists are pushing for federal regulation of the horse racing industry.",

Given that the information provided specifies a threat to 500 structures, which is significantly less than 1,500 homes, it is less likely that more than 1,500 homes would be under orders of evacuation.\n\nTherefore, the more likely scenario is:\n\n(a) More than 1,500 homes are under evacuation orders there.",

This appears less directly relevant to the initial statement about conservatives balancing the curriculum. The phrase \"broader range of perspectives\" seems contrary to the aim stated.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n(a) is more likely because it directly aligns with the influence Texas has over textbook adoption in other states, especially conservative ones, without additional assumptions about including a broader range of perspectives.\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is:\n\n(a) The textbooks will be adopted as mainstream in other conservative states.",
