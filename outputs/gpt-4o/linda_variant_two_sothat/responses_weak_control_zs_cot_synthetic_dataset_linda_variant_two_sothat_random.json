It is a general call for patience and tolerance, which is quite plausible in the context of a message from a political leader after a conflict.\n\n2. **Assessment of Scenario (b):**\n   - Mustafa Jalil, the NTC's chairman, calls on Libyans to be patient and tolerant so that local farmers are encouraged to plant more olive trees.\n   - This statement includes the same call for patience and tolerance but adds a specific reason related to local farmers and the planting of olive trees.\n   - While it is possible that a leader might encourage agricultural efforts as part of rebuilding, this statement is more specific and includes an additional condition.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n- **General Probability:** In probability, a single statement (such as scenario (a)) is generally more likely to occur than a compound statement that includes additional qualifications (such as scenario (b)). The more specific and detailed a scenario becomes, the less likely it is to occur compared to a broader statement.\n  \n- **Conjunction Fallacy:** The conjunction fallacy occurs when people incorrectly believe that the conjunction of two events (in this case, calling for patience and connecting it to the specific act of planting olive trees) is more probable than one of the events alone. In reality, adding additional details usually reduces the probability because it requires more conditions to be met.\n\nTherefore, the more likely scenario is:\n\n(a) Mustafa Jalil, the NTC's chairman, calls on Libyans to be patient and tolerant.",

This conjunction of events (a violent incident and a seemingly unrelated purpose) is much less plausible. Reporting on deaths in a conflict zone for the purpose of promoting a recipe is highly unusual and implausible.\n\nNow, considering the concept of the conjunction fallacy, we understand that adding more specific conditions to a statement generally makes it less likely to be true.

In this scenario, the conjunction fallacy would mean mistakenly believing that (b) is more likely than (a), despite (b) being a subset of (a).\n\n3. **Analysing the Likelihood:**\n   - **Option (a)** is a general statement that Chinese netizens use jokes for political communication. It includes all scenarios where Internet jokes are used for political discussions.\n   - **Option (b)** is more specific, stating not only do Chinese netizens communicate about politics using jokes, but they also do so to increase their social media followers and likes.\n\n4. **Comparing Both Options:**\n   - Since (b) specifies an additional motive (increasing followers and likes), it is inherently less probable than (a), which does not specify an additional motive and is hence broader.\n\nIn conclusion, option (a) is more likely because it encompasses a more general behavior without additional specific conditions. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Chinese netizens use Internet jokes to communicate about politics.",

However, scenario (b) adds an additional detail: the injured suspect misses his favorite TV show that night.\n\nThe likelihood of each event occurring doesn't change the probability that multiple events will all occur together.\n\nSo:\n- Scenario (a) only requires one set of events: the deaths and injury.\n- Scenario (b) requires that same set of events plus an additional, specific event.\n\nAccording to the principle of the conjunction rule in probability, the probability of two events happening together (conjunction) is always less than or equal to the probability of either occurring alone. Therefore, the additional detail in scenario (b) makes it less likely by introducing another condition that must also be true.\n\nThus, scenario (a) is more likely.\n\n**Correct answer: (a)**",

This is a straightforward event that could possibly occur given Vettel\u2019s chance of winning any particular race.\n\n3. **Option (b)**: This states that Vettel took the checkered flag at his home grand prix **and** he did it to promote his new line of sports watches. This involves two events occurring together: Vettel winning the race and doing it specifically for the purpose of promoting sports watches.\n\nTo assess the likelihood:\n\n- A single event (Vettel winning his home grand prix) is usually more probable than a conjunction of two events (Vettel winning and having a promotional motive related to a new line of sports watches).\n\nIn probability theory, the conjunction fallacy is the error of assuming that specific conditions are more probable than a single general one.
