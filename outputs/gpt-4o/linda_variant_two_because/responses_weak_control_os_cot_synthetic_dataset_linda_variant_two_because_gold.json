It states that Debbie Reynolds considers her role in the movie as her favorite, without any additional reasons or conditions.\n\n- **Option (b)**: \"Actress ranks 'Singin' in the Rain' as her favorite role because it was a groundbreaking musical and showcased her talents in both acting and dancing.\"\n  This statement not only includes the primary claim that 'Singin\u2019 in the Rain' is her favorite role, but it also provides specific reasons for why this is the case.\n\nThe conjunction fallacy occurs when people assume that specific conditions are more probable than a single general one. Here, option (b) is more detailed and precise but also more restrictive, combining multiple statements.\n\nGiven that the task is to select the more probable statement, we should select the simpler one because adding more specifics makes it less likely (i.e., it assumes additional conditions that may not hold true).\n\nTherefore, the more probable option is:\n(a) Actress ranks \"Singin' in the Rain\" as her favorite role.",
