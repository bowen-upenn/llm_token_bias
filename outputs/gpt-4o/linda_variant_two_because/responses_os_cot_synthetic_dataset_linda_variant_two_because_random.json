Qatar wanted to provide economic aid to Gaza.\"\n   - This establishes that Qatar has made a move to re-establish trade and aid Gaza.\n\n2. **Option (a)**: \"Israel fears any aid would bolster Hamas, officials say.\"\n   - This statement highlights a common concern that economic aid to Gaza could strengthen Hamas, which is a widely-known issue in the Israeli perspective.\n\n3. **Option (b)**: \"Israel fears any aid would bolster Hamas, officials say because Qatar has a new emir who is eager to improve relations in the region.\"\n   - This option adds an additional layer of reasoning by introducing the context of Qatar's new emir and his motives to improve regional relations.\n\n4. **Probability & Simplicity**:\n   - Adding more specifics (e.g., the new emir and his intentions) to the situation can make the scenario appear less probable because it requires multiple conditions to be true.\n   - According to principles of probability and parsimony (Occam's Razor), the simpler explanation is typically more likely.\n\nTherefore, (a) presents a more straightforward and probable scenario without needing the additional context of Qatar's new emir.\n\nThe correct answer is (a) Israel fears any aid would bolster Hamas, officials say.",

She notes that the FDA now has the ability to regulate the manufacturing, marketing, and sales of tobacco products.\n\nGiven this context:\n- Sindelar is discussing the potential impact of changing the size of cigarette packs.\n- Her focus is on how these changes might affect smokers' habits and willpower.\n\nNow let's examine the options:\n(a) \"Think about it: We could change what it means to be a pack-a-day smoker,\" she says.\n(b) \"Think about it: We could change what it means to be a pack-a-day smoker,\" she says because the color of the packaging will make the cigarettes look more appealing.\n\nOption (a) aligns with Sindelar's discussion about altering pack sizes and potentially affecting smoking habits. She seems to be considering how changes in packaging (in terms of quantity) could redefine smoking behaviors.\n\nOption (b) introduces the idea of packaging color making cigarettes more appealing. This does not align with the context provided, which focuses on changing the number of cigarettes per pack to influence willpower and smoking habits.\n\nTherefore, the more likely statement is:\n(a) \"Think about it: We could change what it means to be a pack-a-day smoker,\" she says.",

Given the context of the oil disaster and the scrutiny from both the government and public, it is reasonable to assume that the company would release an advertisement with a strong, reassuring message about their commitment to resolving the issue.\n\n(b) In BP ad, Hayward promises, \"We will get this done because he feels confident wearing his lucky socks.\"\n- This option introduces a whimsical and less professional element, which seems very unlikely for a corporate advertisement, especially in the context of a major crisis like the oil disaster. Corporations like BP would typically avoid such informal statements in a serious situation and when addressing the public and the government.\n\nGiven the context and the serious nature of the situation, the more probable option is:\n(a) In BP ad, Hayward promises, \"We will get this done.\"",

This is a common political tactic to appear approachable or confident.\n\n2. **Specific Motivation (Option b)**:\n   - While it is possible that Mugabe could have personal reasons for his behavior, like wanting to show off new shoes, adding this specific motivation makes the scenario less likely compared to the more generic behavior described in Option (a). The added detail of the shoes introduces an unnecessary complexity without strong supporting evidence.\n\nGiven this analysis, the simpler and more general behavior described in Option (a) is more likely.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n(a) Mugabe laughed and mugged for reporters as he cast his ballot at a high school.",

Ras Al Khaimah (RAK) is undergoing a rapid luxury property transformation.\n2. It is the northernmost emirate of the UAE and is often overlooked compared to Dubai and Abu Dhabi.\n\n**Option (a):** \n- International hotel brands and developers are flocking to RAK to build new facilities and residences.\n- This option states that developers are interested in RAK due to its rapid luxury property transformation.\n\n**Option (b):**\n- International hotel brands and developers are flocking to RAK to build new facilities and residences because the local cuisine is delicious and the weather is pleasant.\n- This option includes additional specific reasons (delicious local cuisine and pleasant weather) for why developers and hotel brands are interested in RAK.\n\nFrom the information given, we know that RAK is undergoing rapid luxury property transformation and is relatively under the radar compared to Dubai and Abu Dhabi. This suggests developers might see an opportunity for growth and investment. \n\nHowever, the specific reasons cited in option (b) (delicious cuisine and pleasant weather) are additional layers of information that are not explicitly linked to the rapid property transformation. Using the principle of simplicity, or Occam\u2019s razor, it is more straightforward to attribute the interest to the ongoing property transformation rather than introducing specific cultural or climatic reasons unless explicitly stated.\n\nThus, the more likely option is:\n\n(a) International hotel brands and developers are flocking to RAK to build new facilities and residences.",
