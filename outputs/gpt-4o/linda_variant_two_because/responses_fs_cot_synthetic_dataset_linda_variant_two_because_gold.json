Instead, it is mainly focused on expanding health insurance coverage and improving quality of care.\n\nGiven this background, let's analyze the options:\n\n(a) Obamacare does not require hospitals to use electronic medical records.\n- This statement is focused and factual. Obamacare does not have a mandate requiring hospitals to use EMRs; rather, it focuses on broader health policy issues.\n\n(b) Obamacare does not require hospitals to use electronic medical records because the 2009 economic stimulus package provided funding for the health care industry to upgrade their technology.\n- This statement suggests a causal relationship that is not accurate. The 2009 stimulus package provided funds for tech upgrades, but this is a separate effort from the ACA. The ACA focuses more on insurance reforms and improving care quality, not necessarily relying on the previous funding as a reason for not mandating EMRs.\n\nConsidering these points, the more likely and straightforward option is:\n\n(a) Obamacare does not require hospitals to use electronic medical records.",

The modern use of the mask often represents a broader statement against perceived injustice or for social/political activism.\n\nGiven these points, option (a) is more probable because it directly addresses the planned event without ascribing specific motivations that may not be universally held by all participants.\n\nThus, the correct answer is (a) Masked march on Parliament in London planned for Guy Fawkes Night on Saturday.",

Currently, if you're craving a cigarette, the only buying option is the full pack of 20.\n3.

This implies he believes there are significant findings that should be shared with the public.\n\n2. **FIFA's Response**: FIFA has stated that it has no plans to publicize the findings. This could suggest either that the findings are controversial or that FIFA prefers to keep such reports confidential regardless of the content.\n\n3. **Basic Probability**: The likelihood of a single event occurring (e.g., Russia being awarded the 2018 World Cup and Qatar the 2022 World Cup) is always higher than the likelihood of two events occurring together (e.g., those awards plus the additional context of the report\u2019s findings being positive).\n\nGiven these points, let's evaluate the options:\n\n- **Option (a)**: This option states the simple fact that Russia was awarded the 2018 World Cup while Qatar will hold the event in 2022. This is a known fact and is independent of the content of the report.\n\n- **Option (b)**: This option includes the same fact but adds a second layer\u2014that the findings of the report were positive towards both countries and that FIFA's decision-making process is transparent. This additional context is less likely because it introduces more conditions that need to be true for the statement to be true (\"the findings were positive\" and \"the decision-making process is transparent\").\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the basic principle is that a single event (option a) is generally more probable than a combination of events (option b).\n\nThe correct answer is (a) Russia was awarded the 2018 World Cup while Qatar will hold the event in 2022.",
