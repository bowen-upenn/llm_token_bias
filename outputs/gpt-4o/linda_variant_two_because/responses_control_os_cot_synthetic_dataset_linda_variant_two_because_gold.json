Compare the complexity of the options:\n   - Option (a) involves a single event: the fear that aid would bolster Hamas.\n   - Option (b) involves the same event plus an additional condition: the aid bolstering Hamas violating existing sanctions.\n\n3. Apply the rule of conjunction:\n   - The probability of option (a) (a single event) must be higher or equal to the probability of option (b) (the same event and the additional condition).\n\nBased on the principles of probability, option (a) is more likely.\n\nSo the correct answer is (a) Israel fears any aid would bolster Hamas, officials say.",
