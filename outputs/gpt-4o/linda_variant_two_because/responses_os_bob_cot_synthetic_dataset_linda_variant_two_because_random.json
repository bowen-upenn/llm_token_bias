Supporters of Mugabe have allegedly taken people to \"torture bases,\" indicating severe conflict and human rights violations.\n3. Two individuals being treated for broken hands claim they were tortured, supporting the narrative of violence and intimidation in the political context.\n\nGiven the above information, we can infer that the political environment is highly charged and characterized by violence and intimidation. \n\nNow, let's consider the options:\n\n(a) Mugabe laughed and mugged for reporters as he cast his ballot at a high school.\n(b) Mugabe laughed and mugged for reporters as he cast his ballot at a high school because he wanted to show off his new shoes.\n\nOption (a) seems to suggest that Mugabe is projecting confidence or indifference to the political tension while casting his vote. This could be a plausible action for a leader in a contentious political environment, possibly trying to show strength and control.\n\nOption (b) adds a specific reason for Mugabe's behavior\u2014that he wanted to show off his new shoes. This is less likely given the serious and violent context described. It seems improbable that during such a tense and conflict-ridden election, Mugabe's primary concern would be to display his new shoes.\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is:\n\n(a) Mugabe laughed and mugged for reporters as he cast his ballot at a high school.",

When luxury property transformations occur, they are typically driven by economic and strategic factors rather than environmental or culinary delights.\n\n2. **Overlooked Emirate**: This implies RAK has untapped potential compared to its more famous neighbors like Dubai and Abu Dhabi. To capitalize on this potential, developers and hotel brands would likely be motivated by the economic opportunities and strategic advantages of entering a less saturated market.\n\n3. **Option (a)**: States developers and hotel brands are flocking to RAK to build new facilities and residences. This is a straightforward statement and ties directly to the economic opportunities presented by the transformation.\n\n4. **Option (b)**: Adds the specific reasons involving local cuisine and weather. While pleasant weather and delicious local cuisine might be attractive aspects, these are generally not the primary drivers for large-scale luxury property investment and development. The primary reasons are typically economic potential, market demand, and competitive positioning.\n\nTherefore, given the information and the logical reasoning around economic drivers for luxury property development:\n\nThe correct answer is (a) International hotel brands and developers are flocking to RAK to build new facilities and residences.",
