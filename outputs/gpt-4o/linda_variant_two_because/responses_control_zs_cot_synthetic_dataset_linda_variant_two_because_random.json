This is because for the conjunction (A and B) to be true, both individual events must occur simultaneously, which is inherently less probable than the occurrence of either event by itself.\n\n4. **Comparison of Events:**\n    - Option (a) represents a single event: A masked march planned for Guy Fawkes Night.\n    - Option (b) represents the conjunction of two events: A masked march and it happening because of clear skies and mild temperatures.\n\nSince the probability of the conjunction (option b) is less than or equal to the probability of the single event (option a), we conclude that the single event is more likely.\n\n**Answer:**\n(a) Masked march on Parliament in London planned for Guy Fawkes Night on Saturday",
