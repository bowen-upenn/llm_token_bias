It's logical that Israel's specific concern would be tied to the existing sanctions, as they have a legal and strategic basis for preventing aid from reaching Hamas.\n\nTherefore, it is more likely that Israel would express a fear that aid from Qatar would bolster Hamas because it would violate existing sanctions against the terrorist organization.\n\nSo, the more likely option is (b) \"Israel fears any aid would bolster Hamas, officials say because it would violate existing sanctions against the terrorist organization.\"",

The headline indicates a French consul and family were affected by an event involving flying glass, with France calling on Israel to avoid civilian casualties.\n2. Typically, in conflicts involving Israel and Palestine, responses to provocations such as rocket fire are common.\n3. Statement (a) is a more general response from Israel, while statement (b) provides a specific reason for targeting.\n\nGiven these points, the addition of specific details in (b) makes it less likely than the more general statement (a). In general terms, simpler and broader responses (like (a)) are more common in such announcements.\n\nThus, the more likely statement is:\n(a) Israel says the strike was in response to Palestinian rocket fire.",

These are specific instances related to political accountability and personal responsibility.\n\nWhen considering which additional topics Obama is more likely to discuss:\n\nOption (a): Obama also discusses declining economy and fight against terrorist groups.\n- It is common for a sitting president to address broad and significant issues such as the economy and terrorism, especially during an interview.\n\nOption (b): Obama also discusses declining economy and fight against terrorist groups because the public is more interested in those topics than in his personal admission of responsibility.\n- This adds a reason behind why Obama might discuss these topics.

It just gives a probability which, in meteorology, can be derived from weather patterns and forecasting models.\n  \n- **Option (b)** attempts to establish causation. It implies that because of the tornado in Kansas and the strong winds in Pennsylvania, there are moderate chances of severe weather in two other states (Oklahoma and Nebraska).

This statement is simple and doesn't specify why there is a big response.\n\n3. **Evaluating option (b)**: The restaurant owner says there is \"a big response\" from other owners because they are impressed with the proactive steps taken to prevent the spread of flu. This provides a specific reason for the big response.\n\n4. **Analyzing the probabilities**: Adding more specific conditions (like the reason for the response in option (b)) generally makes a statement less probable because there is more detail that must be true for the entire statement to be true. \n\nGiven this information, the more likely option is:\n\n(a) The restaurant owner says there is \"a big response\" from other owners.",
