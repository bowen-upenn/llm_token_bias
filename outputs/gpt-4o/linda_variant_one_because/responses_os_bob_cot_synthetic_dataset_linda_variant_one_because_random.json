Therefore:\n\n- **Option (a)** states that Ken searches for the gift at another store or online, which aligns well with his determined behavior.\n- **Option (b)** adds an additional, unrelated detail (\"because it was a sunny day\"). While Ken might still search for the gift at another store or online regardless of the weather, the reason given is not a factor in his decision-making process.\n\nSince the presence of a sunny day does not logically contribute to Ken's motivation or actions:\n\nThe correct answer is (a) Ken searches for the gift at another store or online.",

Given his emotional attachment and the special nature of the autograph, this is a logical action for him to take.\n\nOption (b) includes irrelevant information about Ben recently learning how to cook Italian cuisine, which is unrelated to the emotional and significant experience of meeting his favorite wrestler and getting an autograph.\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is:\n(a) Ben might frame the autographed shirt to preserve the memory.",

The fact that Yannick likes to eat croissants for breakfast is extraneous information that does not directly affect his likelihood of visiting other landmarks or sending pictures.\n\nSince option (b) adds additional, irrelevant information that does not contribute to the likelihood of the scenario occurring, option (a) is more likely.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n(a) Yannick would likely visit other iconic landmarks in New York City and send pictures to his friends.",
