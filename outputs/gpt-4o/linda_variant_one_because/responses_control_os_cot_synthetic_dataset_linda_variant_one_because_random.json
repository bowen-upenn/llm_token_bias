Option (a) implies a single event: Julie might join a club or group that interests her.\n2. Option (b) implies a conjunction of two events: Julie might join a club or group that interests her because she likes the color of their club logo. This requires both conditions to be met: she likes the club's activities and also the color of their logo.\n\nAccording to the principles of probability, the likelihood of a single event is always greater than or equal to the likelihood of two events happening together. This is because with a conjunction (two events happening simultaneously), there are more specific conditions that need to be satisfied.\n\nTherefore, (a) is more likely than (b).",
