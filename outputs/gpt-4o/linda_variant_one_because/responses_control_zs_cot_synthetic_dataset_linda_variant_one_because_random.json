        "init_model_answer": "To determine which option is more likely, we'll examine the structure of each statement using basic probability principles.\n\nOption (a) states:\n- \"Tom would arrange to pick up the furniture he purchased on Craigslist.\"\n\nOption (b) states:\n- \"Tom would arrange to pick up the furniture he purchased on Craigslist because he enjoys listening to jazz music.\"\n\nNotice that:\n\n- Option (b) is a combination of two events: Tom arranging to pick up the furniture he purchased on Craigslist and Tom enjoying listening to jazz music.\n- Option (a) involves only one event: Tom arranging to pick up the furniture he purchased on Craigslist.\n\nAccording to the conjunction fallacy, the probability of two events occurring together (P(A and B)) is always less than or equal to the probability of either event occurring alone (P(A) or P(B)). This means P(A and B) \u2264 P(A).\n\nIn this context:\n- P(Tom arranging to pick up the furniture purchased on Craigslist) will always be greater than or equal to P(Tom arranging to pick up the furniture purchased on Craigslist AND Tom enjoying listening to jazz music).\n\nApplying this reasoning, we can conclude that:\n\n(a) Tom would arrange to pick up the furniture he purchased on Craigslist is more likely.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a).",
