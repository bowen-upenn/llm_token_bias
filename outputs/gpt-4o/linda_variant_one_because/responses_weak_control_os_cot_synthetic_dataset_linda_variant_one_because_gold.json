The story does not provide specific reasons for why Francis might apologize; it only states the occurrence and the grandparents\u2019 disapproval.\n\n2. **Evaluating Option (a)**:\n   - Option (a) states that \"Francis would apologize to his grandparents.\" This is a single event: the act of apologizing. It doesn't specify any reasons or motivations behind the apology.\n\n3. **Evaluating Option (b)**:\n   - Option (b) states that \"Francis would apologize to his grandparents because he felt guilty and wanted to restore the good relationship.\" This option is more complex; not only does it include the act of apologizing, but it also specifies two motivations for the apology: feeling guilty and wanting to restore the good relationship.\n\n4. **Considering Probabilities**:\n   - For Option (b) to be true, two conditions must be met: Francis must both feel guilty and want to restore the relationship, in addition to the act of apologizing. This makes (b) more specific and consequently more restrictive.\n   - Conversely, for Option (a) to be true, only the act of apologizing is necessary, without specifying any underlying motivations.

It implies that the protagonist has a known allergy to bee stings, which makes the need for medical attention even more critical.\n\n**Considering the Conjunction Fallacy:**\n- The conjunction fallacy occurs when people assume that specific conditions are more probable than a single general one.\n- Here, option (b) is more specific and includes additional information (being allergic to bee stings), so it seems more detailed but is actually less probable because it requires two conditions to be true (the protagonist needing medical attention and being allergic).\n\nThus, the more likely option is (a) The protagonist would likely seek medical attention for the bee sting.",
