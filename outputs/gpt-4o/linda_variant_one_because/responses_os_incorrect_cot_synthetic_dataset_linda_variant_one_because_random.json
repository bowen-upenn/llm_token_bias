After the breakup, he changed the tattoo into an eagle.\n3. There is no information provided about his interests or hobbies, especially not about birdwatching.\n\nNow, let's examine each option:\n(a) The protagonist might show off his new eagle tattoo.\n- This is a straightforward statement that directly follows from the events described. After changing the tattoo, he might want to show off the new design, especially if he is proud of it.\n\n(b) The protagonist might show off his new eagle tattoo because he enjoys birdwatching on weekends.\n- This option adds an additional detail (\"he enjoys birdwatching on weekends\") that is not mentioned or implied in the scenario. Assuming this without evidence would be speculative.\n\nGiven that (a) is supported directly by the information provided without introducing unverified elements, it is the more likely scenario.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a).",

Given Ben's strong emotional reaction and the significance of the autograph, it is reasonable to conclude that he would want to preserve the memory.\n\n   - **Option (b)**: Ben might frame the autographed shirt to preserve the memory because he recently learned how to cook Italian cuisine.\n     - This option introduces an unrelated piece of information about learning to cook Italian cuisine. The ability to cook Italian cuisine has no logical connection to the emotional significance of the autographed shirt.
