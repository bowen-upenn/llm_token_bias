The Great Schlep has Jewish Democrats pitching Barack Obama to elders in Florida.\n2. Schlep is a Yiddish word meaning to pull or tug.\n3. Organizer: Some traditionally Democratic Jews reluctant to support Obama.\n\nGiven this context:\n- Florida has a significant Jewish population.\n- There is a concern among Jewish Democrats about some reluctance to support Obama.\n\nOption (a) states:\n\"Florida has 650,000 Jews, many of them Democrats\"\n\nOption (b) states:\n\"Florida has 650,000 Jews, many of them Democrats to be hesitant in supporting Obama due to his policies.\"\n\nTo determine which is more likely:\n- From the organizer's statement, we know there is a specific concern about reluctance among Jewish Democrats regarding Obama.\n- Therefore, it suggests not just a neutral fact about Jewish Democrats but more specifically their potential hesitation.\n\nThus, the given context makes (b) more likely:\n\"Florida has 650,000 Jews, many of them Democrats to be hesitant in supporting Obama due to his policies.\"\n\nSo between choices:\n\n(a) is about simple demographics.\n\n(b) incorporates the specific sentiment concerning Obama, which matches the organizer's concern.\n\nTherefore, the more likely statement is (b).\n\nYes.",

The Kepler telescope aims to find planet candidates, and as of the data provided, it has found 3,538 planet candidates.\n2. Research indicates that 22% of sun-like stars could have potentially habitable planets. This means not all planet candidates found by Kepler will be potentially habitable; only a subset of them could be.\n\nConsidering the statistics:\n- If 22% of the stars have potentially habitable planets, it implies that the majority (78%) might not have potentially habitable planets.\n- Therefore, it is less likely that all 3,538 planet candidates found by Kepler are potentially habitable.\n\nConclusion:\nGiven the percentage of stars with potentially habitable planets, statement (a) is more likely to be true than statement (b).\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nNo.\n",
