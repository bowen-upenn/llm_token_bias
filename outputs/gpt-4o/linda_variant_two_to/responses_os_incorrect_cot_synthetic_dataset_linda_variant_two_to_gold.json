Therefore, an indictment simply based on evidence of felony murder seems more straightforward and likely.\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is:\n(a) A grand jury indicts the girl's stepmother on a felony murder charge.",

This option focuses solely on matching the promotional aspect without additional complexities.\n\n(b) **Option B:** IHOP giving away pancakes on February 24 but adding the element of raising money for charity. While this is a positive motive and could generate goodwill, it involves an additional layer of purpose\u2014raising funds\u2014that was not necessary for the initial success witnessed by Denny's. Combining philanthropy with a promotional giveaway might dilute the straightforward appeal of a free product aimed purely at drawing in customers looking for free meals. Therefore, adding a charitable aspect makes the event slightly more complex and potentially less directly competitive.\n\nConsidering Occam's Razor (the principle that the simplest explanation is usually the correct one) and the tendency for direct competition in similar circumstances, we can conclude it is more likely:\n\n(a) Competitor IHOP to give away pancakes on February 24.",

Option (b) specifies that the security patrols are specifically to keep fans from visiting Michael Jackson's grave site.\n\n2. **Information Context**: The passage mentions that Forest Lawn Memorial Park employees won't say whether Michael Jackson's body is there. This suggests uncertainty about his exact burial location within the park.\n\n3. **Reasonability and Common Practices**: It is common for funeral companies to have stringent security patrols to protect the graves in general and maintain order. \n\nGiven these points, the more likely option would be the more general statement:\n\n(a) Funeral company has stringent security patrols.",

        "use_multi_agents": false,
        "init_model_answer": "To determine which option is more likely, we should break down the context provided:\n\n1. **Information Provided:**\n   - A 27-year-old woman was on her honeymoon with John McAreavey, a Gaelic football star, in Mauritius.\n   - The Mauritius police have indicated that John McAreavey is not a suspect in his wife's death.\n   - The phrase \"This is too horrible to contemplate\" is given as part of the context, suggesting a sense of shock and deep sorrow from those who hear about the incident.\n\n2. **Options Analysis:**\n   - **(a)** \"We are just all devastated,\" says her father, Mickey Harte.\n     - This option is straightforward and could be plausible given the context of a tragic and unexpected event.\n   - **(b)** \"We are just all devastated,\" says her father, Mickey Harte to a group of reporters after hearing the news.\n     - This option provides additional detail about the setting in which Mickey Harte expressed his feelings. It specifies that he made this statement to a group of reporters, which is a common reaction in the wake of widely publicized tragic events.\n\n3. **Common Reactions in Tragic Events:**\n   - In highly publicized tragedies, it is common for family members to make statements to the press or a group of reporters. This aligns with the idea that the tragedy involving a well-known sports figure\u2019s wife would attract media attention.\n\nGiven the added detail that Mickey Harte is speaking to a group of reporters, option (b) is more likely because it provides context consistent with how families often publicly express their grief in highly publicized cases.\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is:\n(b) \"We are just all devastated,\" says her father, Mickey Harte to a group of reporters after hearing the news.",
