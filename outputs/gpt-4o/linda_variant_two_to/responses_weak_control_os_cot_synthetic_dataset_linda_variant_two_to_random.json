It not only states that no injuries were reported but adds an additional condition about those people having previously visited the dam before the incident.\n\nIn terms of probability:\n- A general statement (a) about no injuries in the flooding is simpler and more likely because it applies to the entire situation without added conditions.\n- A specific statement (b) has an additional qualifier, making it a subset of the general set of all people involved in the flooding. Therefore, the probability of the specific case cannot be higher than the general case.\n\nThus, the correct and more probable answer is:\n\n(a) No injuries were reported in the flooding.",

It does not include any additional conditions or assumptions beyond the company's announcement.\n\n2. **Option (b)**: \"Cervarix will be available later this year, according to GlaxoSmithKline to boost holiday season sales.\"\n\nThis statement includes the additional detail that the availability of Cervarix is specifically to boost holiday season sales. It adds an extra layer of specificity and assumption that the timing of the vaccine's release is linked to holiday sales strategy rather than other factors.\n\nIn probability terms, the more specific a statement is, the less likely it is to be true compared to a less specific statement. This is because the specific statement (option b) relies on more conditions being met (i.e., the vaccine being released later this year and the release being linked to holiday sales).\n\nTherefore, the more probable option is:\n\n(a) Cervarix will be available later this year, according to GlaxoSmithKline.",

Suicides by trains, while deeply unfortunate, do happen.\n- **Option (b):** This scenario includes an additional, very specific detail (picking up a dropped coin) alongside the suicide. The added detail makes this scenario more complex and thus, less likely because it requires two events to happen simultaneously: 1) Derek Ward committing suicide and 2) the specific action of picking up a coin leading to the suicide.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe essential principle is that the probability of two events happening together (conjunction) is always less than or equal to the probability of either one happening alone.

The issue at hand has no connection to public awareness about recycling, making this option less plausible.\n\n4. **Conjunction Fallacy**: The probability of two events occurring together (in conjunction) is always less than or equal to the probability of either one occurring alone. Option (b) involves a conjunction of two specific, unrelated events (opposing the march and linking it to recycling), which is less likely than the single event in option (a).\n\nGiven these considerations, the more likely statement is:\n\n(a) British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said there would be \"no support\" for the march.",
