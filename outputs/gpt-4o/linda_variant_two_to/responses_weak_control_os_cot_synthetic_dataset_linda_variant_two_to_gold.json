This is a general statement and requires only one probable event to occur: the residents taking to the streets.\n\n3. **Option (b)**:\n   - This option states that ethnic Uyghur residents take to the streets to protest against government policies and demand greater autonomy. This option combines the event of taking to the streets with specific reasons for doing so.\n\n4. **Probability Analysis**:\n   - Generally in probability, the occurrence of a single event (ethnic Uyghur residents taking to the streets) is more likely than the occurrence of a combination of events (taking to the streets for specific reasons).\n   - Thus, regardless of the specifics of the context, a single event (taking to the streets) has a higher probability than a conjunctive event (taking to the streets plus protesting specific grievances).\n\nBased on the concept of conjunction fallacy, where the probability of two events together (conjunction) is always less than or equal to the probability of either one of the events happening alone, the more probable option is:\n\n(a) Ethnic Uyghur residents in Urumqi, capital of Xinjiang region, take to streets.",

This is because a specific event includes additional conditions that make it less likely.\n\n2. **Option (a)**: \"Funeral company has stringent security patrols.\" This is a broad statement that suggests the funeral company could have stringent security for various reasons, not necessarily limited to Michael Jackson's grave.\n\n3. **Option (b)**: \"Funeral company has stringent security patrol to keep fans from visiting Michael Jackson's specific grave site.\" This statement is more specific because it adds the condition that the stringent security patrols are specifically to keep fans from visiting Michael Jackson's grave.\n\nAccording to the conjunction rule in probability, a specific condition (like in option (b)) cannot be more probable than a general condition (like in option (a)).\n\nThus, based on this analysis, the answer should be:\n\n(a) Funeral company has stringent security patrols.",
