This is known as the conjunction fallacy. \n\nTherefore, considering the principles of probability, the more likely statement is:\n\n(a) Demi's Lovelace role is rumoured to be filled by Chlo\u00eb Sevigny.",

It requires an additional narrative that isn't supported by the initial information provided.\n\n4. **Choosing the More Likely Option:**\n   - Given the initial information, there is no mention of multiple crime scenes, a series of crimes, or activities in different locations. Adding these assumptions makes option (b) less likely as it introduces unsupported elements.\n   - Option (a) is more straightforward and consistent with the information provided, focusing only on the type of weapon used in the incident.\n\n**Therefore, the more likely option is (a): Gunman used a high-powered rifle with scope, authorities say.**",

        "init_model_answer": "To determine which option is more likely, let's break down the information provided:\n\n1. **Botswana's Recognition of Ouattara**: The fact that Botswana recognizes Ouattara as the rightful winner indicates that they support legitimate democratic processes and have an interest in maintaining peace and security in Africa.\n\n2. **Concern for Regional Peace**: Botswana expresses a concern that the situation in Ivory Coast threatens regional peace and security, further indicating their broader interest in stability and democratic governance across Africa.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\nOption (a) states that the leaders of Botswana also opposed the outcome of Zimbabwe's elections two years ago. This is a general statement about Botswana's political stance on another election, without specifying the reasons.\n\nOption (b) suggests that the leaders of Botswana opposed the outcome of Zimbabwe's elections two years ago specifically to demonstrate solidarity with democratic movements in the region.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n- Botswana's actions regarding Ouattara suggest they support legitimate democratic outcomes and are concerned about regional stability.\n- Both options (a) and (b) imply that Botswana also opposed the outcome of Zimbabwe's elections, which fits with their stance on supporting democratic processes.\n- Option (b) adds an additional layer of motivation, providing a specific reason (solidarity with democratic movements) for Botswana's opposition to the Zimbabwe election results.\n\nGiven that governments typically have consistent policies and reasons for their actions, it is reasonable to assume that if Botswana opposed the outcome of Zimbabwe's elections, it would be for reasons consistent with their other actions, such as supporting democracy and regional stability.\n\nHowever, the first option (a) makes a broader and less specific claim, which requires fewer assumptions.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe more likely option is:\n(a) The leaders of Botswana also opposed the outcome of Zimbabwe's elections two years ago.",
