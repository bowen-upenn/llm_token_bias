Hence, option (b) contains more specific information, making it less likely than option (a), which is simpler and broader.\n\nThus, we can conclude that:\n\n(a) Demi's Lovelace role is rumoured to be filled by Chlo\u00eb Sevigny\n\nis more likely.",

Both scenarios involve the grand jury indicting the stepmother on a felony murder charge. However, option (b) suggests that the primary motivation behind the indictment is to prevent the stepmother from influencing the grandmother's trial.\n\nFirst, let's consider option (a):\n- A felony murder charge would be based on the evidence that the stepmother had a role in the events leading to Savannah Hardin's death.\n- The indictment would be a result of the grand jury's assessment of the stepmother's actions and their connection to the felony murder charge.\n\nNext, let's consider option (b):\n- This scenario implies a strategic motivation beyond the legal evaluation of the stepmother's actions.\n- It is less common for legal decisions to be influenced explicitly to affect another person's trial, as the legal system typically relies on the evidence and facts related to each individual's involvement.\n\nGiven that grand juries focus on the legal evidence at hand and typically aim to ensure that charges reflect the individual's actions and their consequences:\n\n**The more likely scenario is (a): A grand jury indicts the girl's stepmother on a felony murder charge.**\n\nThis option focuses on the stepmother's actions and their direct connection to the crime, which is a standard procedure for indictments based on evidence.",

Pirates typically involve themselves in high-reward illicit activities that can be lucrative and hence can attract organized crime for financial benefits.\n\nGiven these factors, it is more comprehensive and logical that organized-crime would take over pirate groups to help fund their broader illegal activities. Therefore, the detailed explanation in option (b) appears more likely.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n(b) Organized-crime elements have taken over pirate groups, officials say to help fund their illegal activities.",

He highlights specific examples, like Gingrich using the \"Washington\" card and Santorum labeling Obama a snob on education. This indicates a strategy focused on extreme actions to appeal to a particular segment of the electorate.\n\n2. **Implication of Strategy**: Granderson suggests that the approach of pushing to the \"edge of lunacy\" is not effective. This implies that the strategy of proving their tea party credibility through extreme means is having negative consequences.\n\n3. **Moderate Voters**: The extreme actions primarily aimed at appeasing the far-right base could alienate moderate voters, which is crucial in winning broader support in elections.\n\n4. **Option Analysis**:\n   - (a) implies the strategy is simply backfiring without mentioning the specific consequence of losing moderate voters.\n   - (b) explicitly mentions that the backfiring includes losing moderate voters while trying to appease the far-right base.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most comprehensive interpretation aligning with Granderson's critique would include the negative impact on electoral appeal, particularly losing moderate voters.

This prediction does not specify the intensity but defines \"major\" hurricanes as Category 3 or higher.\n\n2. **Hurricane and Temperature Correlation**:\n   - **Unusually Warm Atlantic Temperatures**: Warmer surface temperatures in the tropical Atlantic can lead to more energy for storms, which can increase the number and intensity of hurricanes.\n   - **Boosting Storms**: Warmer temperatures are likely to boost the number and intensity of storms (Make them stronger).\n\n3. **Category 5 Intensity**: A Category 5 hurricane is the highest category on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, representing wind speeds of 157 mph or higher. It is rare and requires specific conditions beyond just warm surface temperatures, such as favorable atmospheric conditions (low wind shear, etc.).\n\n4. **Option Analysis**:\n   - **Option (a)** states that unusually warm tropical Atlantic surface temperatures are expected to boost storms.\n   - **Option (b)** states that unusually warm tropical Atlantic surface temperatures are expected to boost storms to Category 5 intensity.\n\nMore frequent and intense hurricanes (option (a)) are more common than the very specific requirement of reaching Category 5 intensity (option (b)). While warm surface temperatures are a critical factor, other atmospheric conditions must also align perfectly for a storm to reach Category 5, making it a rarer event.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBetween the two options, the more general statement that unusually warm tropical Atlantic surface temperatures are expected to boost storms is more likely.

While it\u2019s also a valid health practice, the information provided doesn't explicitly mention disease concerns. The focus is rather on space and genetic policies.\n\nConsidering the explicit information available and typical zoo practices:\n\n(a) **Giraffe's carcass was fed to zoo's carnivores** is more likely because it aligns with practical and resource management practices in zoos. There is no explicit mention of disease prevention being a reason, which adds an unnecessary complexity not implied in the given information.\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is:\n(a) Giraffe's carcass was fed to zoo's carnivores.",

Such a large number of detainments suggests a significant police action following possibly tumultuous events.\n\n2. **Halting gatherings in specific locations:** Police have halted people from gathering in Yili Kazak Prefecture, Aksu City, and Kashgar, which are areas with significant Uyghur populations. The prevention of gatherings often happens in contexts of heightened sensitivity or unrest.\n\n3. **Casualties and Injuries:** There are reports of 156 people killed and more than 800 others injured following violence. The scale of this violence indicates a serious disturbance.\n\nGiven these points, we can infer:\n- The detentions and efforts to stop gatherings indicate a police response to unrest or protests.\n- The substantial casualties and injuries point to violent clashes possibly related to broader socio-political issues affecting the Uyghur community.\n\nNow let's evaluate the options:\n\n(a) Ethnic Uyghur residents in Urumqi, capital of Xinjiang region, take to streets.\n\n(b) Ethnic Uyghur residents in Urumqi, capital of Xinjiang region, take to streets to protest against government policies and demand greater autonomy.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n- The large detainment figure and disrupted gatherings suggest organized actions, which are often responses to perceived grievances.\n- The notable number of casualties and injuries hints that the violence was related to significant underlying issues, likely political or cultural in nature.\n- Historically, Uyghur protests in Xinjiang, particularly in Urumqi, have been connected to demands for greater autonomy and opposition to government policies.\n\nConsidering these factors, the context strongly suggests that the actions are not merely people taking to the streets, but rather actions driven by specific grievances or demands.\n\nTherefore, the more likely scenario is:\n(b) Ethnic Uyghur residents in Urumqi, capital of Xinjiang region, take to streets to protest against government policies and demand greater autonomy.",

While panoramic views at 30 kilometers are likely, zero-gravity experience is not consistent with this altitude.\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is:\n(a) The first flight is expected to take off in three years.",

This suggests that conformity and group influence can directly affect how people perceive information.\n\n2. **Solomon Asch's Famous Experiment**:\n    - Solomon Asch's 1950s experiment demonstrated how individuals conform to group opinions even when the group is clearly wrong. This classic study highlights the power of social influence on individual judgment.\n\nGiven this context:\n\n**Option (a)**:\n- This implies rethinking committees that rely on unanimous consent. Considering the studies, this makes sense because the unanimous consent might pressure individuals to conform to the group, potentially distorting true opinions and judgments.\n\n**Option (b)**:\n- This suggests including members with expertise in brain imaging studies in committees that decide by unanimous consent. While expertise in brain imaging might add interesting insight into understanding group dynamics and perception shifts, the primary concern based on the studies cited seems to be about the influence of unanimity on inducing conformity.\n\nBy comparing both options in the context of reducing the influence of conformity and ensuring honest, individual inputs on committees:\n\n**Option (a)** directly addresses the central issue of potentially misleading consensus driven by group pressure as revealed by the studies. **Option (b)** introduces a specific expertise which might be tangentially related but does not as directly resolve the core issue of conformity pressure.\n\nTherefore, the more likely outcome based on the provided information is:\n\n(a) Researcher: Rethink committees that decide by unanimous consent",

There's a suggestion in the text that this can be traced back or linked to environments of repression.\n\n4. **U. S. Response**: The question is centered around the U.S. reaction to these human rights abuses by its ally, Saudi Arabia.\n\nBy considering these points, the statement under consideration suggests the following:\n\n- The U.S., due to its alliance with Saudi Arabia, might criticize the more extreme abuses like flogging because they attract international attention and can cause a public backlash.\n- However, the U.S. remains silent on broader, routine abuses that the Saudi regime carries out against its citizens. \n\nGiven that the silence on routine abuses is mentioned explicitly as a strategy, this aligns with the idea of concealing its interests in the region. This suggests that the strategic interests\u2014like oil, military cooperation, and geopolitical considerations\u2014play a significant role in shaping the U.S.'s selective outrage.\n\nTherefore, the more detailed explanation matches:\n\n(b) slammed flogging by its ally, but is silent on routine, grotesque abuses of Saudi citizens to conceal its strategic interests in the region.",

Surviving a landing is simpler and more direct than surviving and then celebrating together later. Any number of scenarios could prevent the celebration, such as passengers being taken to different hospitals, needing medical attention, or simply not organizing a celebration.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the likelihood of option (a) (the basic survival event) is higher than option (b) (which involves an additional specific action).\n\nTherefore, the more likely event is:\n(a) All 155 passengers and crew members on board survived the landing.",

This statement is about the total number of planet candidates identified by Kepler without specifying the habitability.\n   - **Option (b)**: Kepler has found 3,538 planet candidates to date to have at least one potentially habitable planet. This statement suggests that all 3,538 candidates have at least one potentially habitable planet, which is a much stronger claim.\n\nGiven that only 22% of sun-like stars are estimated to have possibly habitable planets, it is highly improbable that all 3,538 planet candidates would each have at least one potentially habitable planet. This would imply nearly 100% of Kepler's findings are potentially habitable, which contradicts the 22% estimate.\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is:\n\n(a) Kepler has found 3,538 planet candidates to date.",

Therefore, it is plausible that popular games like \"Vainglory\" and \"Asphalt 8\" would be among those optimized for the new screen sizes.\n\n- **Exclusive Gameplay Enhancements**: Introducing exclusive gameplay enhancements specifically for the larger screens of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus adds an extra layer of complexity. Not every game might offer exclusive enhancements simply because the development resources needed for such specific optimizations might not be justified if the enhancement is solely for the screen size difference.\n\nGiven this analysis, **option (a)** is more likely because it only mentions that the games will take advantage of the larger screen size, something that is within reach and is typically expected when new devices with different screen sizes are released. It does not require additional and more specific enhancements which would be less guaranteed.\n\nThus, the more likely option is:\n(a) Games taking advantage of screen size will include Vainglory, Asphalt 8",
