This principle holds because each additional condition added to an event generally makes it less likely.\n\n2. **Option (a)**: The scenario in this option only requires that the media group attract a certain number of unique visitors worldwide.

It not only requires the media group to attract 270 million unique visitors but specifically states that this number must be for an annual picnic event. The specificity of the event (a picnic) and the extremely large number of visitors make this scenario highly unlikely when compared to the more general scenario of overall visitors.\n\nTherefore, when considering which option is more likely, option (a) is more probable because it requires fewer conditions to be met and does not specify an unlikely context like option (b).\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n(a) The group is expected to have a combined 270 million unique visitors worldwide.",

This statement is relatively straightforward and involves a single condition (being a country of interest).\n\n2. **Additional Detail:**\n   - Scenario (b) incorporates the same base information as scenario (a) but adds an additional detail: these countries will host a regional conference on trade and economic development next year.\n   - This additional detail makes the statement more specific and introduces an extra layer of complexity.

Given the context, it sounds plausible that these groups might be critical because his comments could be seen as exclusionary or inappropriate.\n   - **Option (b)**: This option states that Muslim and Jewish groups are critical of McCain's remarks specifically in the context of celebrating his birthday. This adds an extra layer of specificity that seems quite unlikely. It implies that these groups are critical of the remarks while simultaneously acknowledging his birthday celebration, which is an unusual and less likely scenario.\n\n3. **Conjunction Fallacy**: According to the conjunction fallacy, people might incorrectly assume that more specific conditions are more probable than a general one. In reality, a single condition (option a) is more likely than a combination of conditions (option b).\n\nGiven this analysis, (a) is the more likely scenario because it involves only the criticism without adding the highly specific and less probable context of celebrating his birthday. \n\nSo the answer is:\n(a) Muslim and Jewish groups critical of GOP presidential candidate's remarks.",

This is a common practice in zoos to utilize the carcasses in a way that benefits the zoo and reduces waste.\n\n(b) **Giraffe's carcass was fed to zoo's carnivores to celebrate the zookeeper's birthday.**\n- While this option falls within the realm of possibility, it introduces an additional specific detail: the celebration of the zookeeper's birthday. This makes the scenario more specific and less likely in comparison to option (a) because now two conditions must be met: the carcass being fed to carnivores and it being specifically to celebrate a birthday.\n\nBy evaluating both options, we can see that:\n\n- Option (a) involves a single condition: the giraffe's carcass being fed to carnivores.\n- Option (b) involves two conditions: the giraffe's carcass being fed to carnivores and the event being tied to a birthday celebration.\n\nGiven that more specific conditions make an event less likely, option (a) is more likely than option (b).\n\nThus, the more likely option is:\n\n**(a) Giraffe's carcass was fed to zoo's carnivores.**",

Here\u2019s the step-by-step thinking process:\n\n1. **Option (a):** \"A sanctions group deplores sales of arms to Syria.\" \n   - This statement asserts that a sanctions group disapproves of selling weapons to Syria. Given the context of violence and opposition groups reporting deaths, it is reasonable to assume that a sanctions group would focus on the primary issue of arms sales and their immediate impact on the conflict.\n\n2. **Option (b):** \"A sanctions group deplores sales of arms to Syria to improve educational facilities.\"\n   - This statement is more specific. It combines the general disapproval of arms sales with an additional, specific reason: to improve educational facilities. For this scenario to be true, not only must the sanctions group deplore arms sales, but there must also be a direct link to educational improvements as their reason for the stance.\n\nBecause option (b) adds an extra condition to option (a), it is inherently less likely. In probability, the likelihood of two specific events happening together (e.g., deploring arms sales and linking it specifically to educational facilities) is always less than or equal to the likelihood of one of those events happening alone (e.g., simply deploring arms sales).\n\n**Conclusion:** \n(a) A sanctions group deplores sales of arms to Syria.\n\nThis option is more likely because it is less specific and does not require an additional condition to be true.",

The same factual finding mentioned in (a) \u2014 Kepler has found 3,538 planet candidates.\n    2. That this information will be mentioned in a popular science fiction novel.\n\nStep 3: Consider the conjunction rule in probability, which states that the probability of two events happening together (in conjunction) is always less than or equal to the probability of either event happening alone.\n\nStep 4: Since (b) requires the conjunction of two separate events (finding 3,538 planet candidates and being mentioned in a popular science fiction novel), its likelihood is necessarily equal to or less than the likelihood of just the first event happening alone.\n\nConclusion: Based on the principles of probability, option (a) is more likely than option (b).\n\nThe more likely option is:\n(a) Kepler has found 3,538 planet candidates to date.",

It encompasses any form of connections, partnerships, or relationships that Israel might have.\n\nOption (b) is a more specific scenario, describing a specific event \u2014 celebrating Thanksgiving together, which implies a particular type or occasion of interaction.\n\nIn probability terms, a broader statement (option a) is almost always more likely than a specific scenario because it includes a wider range of possibilities. The specific scenario (option b) is a subset of the broader statement (a). \n\nTherefore, considering all potential ties, relationships, or connections Israel might have without limiting it to the specific case of celebrating Thanksgiving together is logically more likely.\n\nThus, the more likely option is:\n(a) Israeli ties",

Option (a) simply states that Vainglory and Asphalt 8 will adapt to the new screen size. This is a general statement about the games leveraging the new hardware feature (i.e., the bigger screen).\n2. Option (b) states not only that Vainglory and Asphalt 8 will adapt to the new screen size but also includes an additional specific detail\u2014that they will also offer a free coffee coupon.\n\n**Conjunction Fallacy:**\nThe conjunction fallacy occurs when people assume two events occurring together (a specific condition and a general one) are more likely than just the general event happening alone. This is often not correct because adding specific details (\u2018free coffee coupon\u2019) makes the event less, not more, likely.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- It is always more likely for a simple event (option a) to occur than for a combined event (option b) to occur because the latter requires additional conditions to be met.\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is (a).",

This could be due to a variety of reasons, such as protecting the privacy of the deceased, preventing vandalism, or managing the influx of fans and followers.\n\nOption (b): \"Funeral company has stringent security patrol to promote eco-friendly practices within the cemetery.\"\n- This statement includes the idea from (a) that the funeral company has stringent security patrols but adds an additional condition: that these patrols are specifically aimed at promoting eco-friendly practices within the cemetery. This makes the statement more specific and restrictive.\n\nTo determine which statement is more likely, we should consider the principle of conjunction fallacy. When two events are combined into one statement, the likelihood of the combined event (the conjunction) is always less than or equal to the likelihood of either event occurring independently.\n\nIn this case:\n- The likelihood of the funeral company having stringent security patrols (Option a) is generally high, given the context of celebrities' graves attracting attention.\n- The likelihood of these security patrols being specifically for promoting eco-friendly practices (Option b) is more restrictive and therefore less likely than the general security patrols alone.\n\nThe more specific and conjunctive statement (Option b) cannot be more likely than the broader statement (Option a).\n\nThus, the more likely option is:\n(a) Funeral company has stringent security patrols.",
