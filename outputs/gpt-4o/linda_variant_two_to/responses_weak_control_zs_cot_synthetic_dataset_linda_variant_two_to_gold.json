The claim in (b) is that the \"countries of interest\" (Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq) would be subjected to less stringent security checks compared to \"state sponsors of terrorism\".

In this case, option (b) is more detailed because it includes not just giving away pancakes but also doing it to raise money for charity.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. **Considering IHOP's promotional activities**: It is plausible for IHOP to run a promotional campaign giving away free pancakes, especially since competitors often follow similar promotional strategies to stay competitive.\n   \n2. **Charity Element**: Adding the element \"to raise money for charity\" introduces a second condition.\n\n- According to the laws of probability, the likelihood of two events happening together (in conjunction) is always less than or equal to the likelihood of either one happening alone. Therefore, the probability that IHOP will give away pancakes AND that it will be specifically to raise money for charity is lower than the probability of just giving away pancakes.\n\nGiven this analysis, the more likely option is:\n\n(a) Competitor IHOP to give away pancakes on February 24",

Here are the two events in statement (b):\n1. Lines form early for Lumpia Shack's Philippines-inspired food (same as statement (a)).\n2. The reason for the lines is because of the best spring rolls served outside of Manila.\n\nSince statement (b) includes both the events listed together, it is less likely than statement (a), which only includes the first event.\n\nThus, the more likely option is:\n\n(a) Lines form early for Lumpia Shack's Philippines-inspired food.",

Option (a): \"All 155 passengers and crew members on board survived the landing.\"\n\n2. Option (b): \"All 155 passengers and crew members on board survived the landing to celebrate a miraculous escape together later that evening.\"\n\nLet's analyze these:\n\n- **Option (a)** only states that all 155 passengers and crew members survived the landing. There is no further condition or event attached to it other than survival.\n\n- **Option (b)** includes the same condition as option (a) (that all 155 passengers and crew members survived the landing) but adds another event: celebration of a miraculous escape together later that evening.\n\nFor option (b) to be true, both parts of the statement have to be true: \n1. All 155 passengers and crew members survived the landing.\n2. They all celebrated a miraculous escape together later that evening.\n\nGiven that option (b) includes an additional condition, logically, the probability of both events (survival and celebration) happening together is less than or equal to the probability of just one event (survival). This is because the occurrence of the second event (celebration) is dependent on the first event (survival), making it a subset of option (a)'s scenario.\n\nSo, based on a basic understanding of probabilities and logical reasoning:\n\n- **Option (a)** involves a single condition: survival.\n- **Option (b)** involves two conditions: survival and a subsequent celebration.\n\nThus, **Option (a)** is more likely than **Option (b)**.\n\nThe more likely option is (a).",

There are 650,000 Jews in Florida, many of whom are Democrats.\n     2. Many of these Jewish Democrats are hesitant to support Obama due to his policies.\n\n3. **Likelihood Comparison:**\n   - **(a)** only requires one component to be true.\n   - **(b)** requires both components to be true simultaneously.\n   - Given that both (a) and (b) require the initial fact (Florida has 650,000 Jews, many of them Democrats), and (b) adds an additional condition about their hesitance toward Obama, (b) is necessarily less likely because it is more specific and restrictive.\n\nTherefore, considering the step-by-step analysis, we conclude that:\n\n(a) Florida has 650,000 Jews, many of them Democrats\n\nThis statement is more likely than statement (b).",

It simply implies there are ties between the countries, without indicating whether they are positive, negative, or affected by any specific events.\n\n3. **Evaluating Option (b)**:\n   - \"Israeli ties to be negatively affected by the ongoing disagreements over construction plans\" is a more specific option.\n   - It states not only the presence of ties but also predicts a negative impact specifically due to the disagreements over the construction plans in East Jerusalem.\n\n4. **Likelihood Analysis**:\n   - U.S.-Israeli ties in general (Option (a)) have been a longstanding reality. The existence of ties is broader and more general.\n   - The likelihood of these ties being negatively affected due to a specific ongoing event (Option (b)) is a more detailed scenario and adds a layer of specificity by mentioning the cause and nature of the impact.\n\nConsidering the conjunction fallacy, where people tend to find a more specific condition more probable than a general one due to over-specifying details, it is important to recognize that a broader statement (a) inherently has more ways to be true.\n\nTherefore, **the more likely option is (a) - Israeli ties**.

The statement in option (a) is a subset of the statement in option (b). If option (b) is true, then option (a) must also be true because it only makes a broader claim without demanding additional conditions.\n2. Adding additional conditions or features (as in option (b)) makes it a more specific and detailed claim.

It could be for overall security, protection of all graves, or various other reasons.\n\n### Analyzing Option (b):\n- This option specifies that the stringent security patrols are in place *specifically* to keep fans from visiting Michael Jackson's grave site. This makes the scenario more specific and adds an additional condition to the patrols.\n\n### Conjunction Fallacy:\n- The conjunction fallacy occurs when people assume that specific conditions are more probable than a single general one. In this case, option (b) is more specific because it mentions Michael Jackson's specific grave site, making it a subset condition of option (a).\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Since any patrols specifically aimed at Michael Jackson's grave would still fall under the general category of security patrols, option (a) is less specific and therefore more likely because it covers a broader range of reasons for having stringent security.\n\nThus, the more likely option is:\n(a) Funeral company has stringent security patrols.",
