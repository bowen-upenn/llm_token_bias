This would make birth control less available because certain methods, like IUDs, couldn't be obtained over the counter.\n\nGiven this context:\n\nOption (a) states: \"Richards: Proposal, aimed at thwarting Obamacare, amounts to $483 million tax on women.\"\n\nOption (b) states: \"Richards: Proposal, aimed at thwarting Obamacare, amounts to $483 million tax on women to cover the increased costs of over-the-counter sales.\"\n\nStep-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1.

This promotion included a Super Bowl ad and cost $5 million.\n3. This promotion likely garnered significant attention and potentially inspired competitors.\n\nNow, let's consider the two options:\n\n(a) Competitor IHOP to give away pancakes on February 24.\n(b) Competitor IHOP to give away pancakes on February 24 to raise money for charity.\n\nOption (a) suggests that IHOP might follow Denny's example and give away free pancakes to attract customers and increase publicity.\n\nOption (b) adds an additional stipulation: not only giving away pancakes but also doing so to raise money for charity. This is a more specific and therefore less probable scenario since it involves an additional condition.\n\nGiven that (a) is a broader and less detailed requirement, it is more likely.\n\nThe more likely option is (a) Competitor IHOP to give away pancakes on February 24.",

This is because it makes a less specific claim, which does not require the additional condition of exclusive gameplay enhancements.\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is (a).",

        "init_model_answer": "To determine which option is more likely, we need to consider the information provided and the context:\n\n1. Celebrities' graves often become public shrines for fans and followers.\n2. Grave hunters are expected to try to visit Michael Jackson's burial site.\n3. The employees of Forest Lawn Memorial Park are not disclosing whether Jackson's body is located there.\n\nGiven this situation, let's analyze the options:\n\nOption (a) suggests that the funeral company has stringent security patrols in general. This is a broad statement that could apply to many scenarios or graves, not necessarily specific to Michael Jackson.\n\nOption (b) suggests that the funeral company has stringent security patrols specifically to keep fans from visiting Michael Jackson's grave site. This is a more specific scenario and assumes that the security is primarily or solely focused on his grave site due to expected fan activity.\n\nGiven that the provided information indicates there are concerns about fans visiting Michael Jackson's burial site (even though it's not confirmed whether his body is there), it would be reasonable for the company to implement specific measures to address this potential issue.\n\nTherefore, the more likely answer is:\n(b) Funeral company has stringent security patrol to keep fans from visiting Michael Jackson's specific grave site.",
