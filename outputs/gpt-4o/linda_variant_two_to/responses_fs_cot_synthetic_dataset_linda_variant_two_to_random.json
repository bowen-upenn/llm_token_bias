This adds an extra layer of specificity to the rumor.\n\nAccording to the principles of probability, the statement with fewer conditions or assumptions is more likely to be true. Since option (a) involves a single condition (the role replacement rumor) and option (b) involves two conditions (the role replacement rumor and Sevigny's personal hobby influencing this decision), option (a) is more likely.\n\nThus, the correct answer is (a) Demi's Lovelace role is rumoured to be filled by Chlo\u00eb Sevigny.",

Sea Shepherd is a well-known conservation group that often actively works to disrupt activities they see as harmful to marine life, such as Japanese whaling.\n2. The inclusion of grappling hooks and attacks aligns with the intense confrontations that can occur during these disruptions.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\n(a) Sea Shepherd's vessel Steve Irwin is attempting to disrupt Japanese whaling ships.\n- This aligns directly with Sea Shepherd's known objective to halt whaling activities, making it a straightforward and likely scenario.\n\n(b) Sea Shepherd's vessel Steve Irwin is attempting to disrupt Japanese whaling ships to increase their media coverage.\n- While gaining media coverage might be a secondary benefit or a side effect, attributing a primary motive like \"to increase their media coverage\" adds an additional layer of intention that isn't necessarily required to explain the disruption activities.\n\nGiven that the simpler explanation (a) aligns with the well-known objectives of Sea Shepherd without adding extra layers of intention, the more likely option is:\n\n(a) Sea Shepherd's vessel Steve Irwin is attempting to disrupt Japanese whaling ships.",

The U.S. plane needed to evade the encounter.\n\nNow, we evaluate the options:\n\n(a) The plane evaded the encounter by flying into Swedish airspace without permission.\n- This scenario makes sense as an immediate action to avoid the intercept by Russian forces by entering a nearby neutral country's airspace, even if done without permission.\n\n(b) The plane evaded the encounter by flying into Swedish airspace without permission to attend an international air show scheduled the following week.\n- The added detail of attending an air show does not contribute to the immediate need to evade an intercept. It is an unnecessary and less likely reason given the urgent context described.\n\nConsidering the urgency and context of the situation, we can conclude:\n\nThe more likely scenario is (a) the plane evaded the encounter by flying into Swedish airspace without permission.",

This is a known fact.\n\n2. **Additional condition (ordering pizza):** Adding an additional, specific condition like ordering pizza for dinner makes (b) less probable. This is because it introduces a highly specific activity that is not necessarily related to the initial condition (surviving the landing). \n\nGiven these analyses, we conclude:\n\nThe correct answer is (a) All 155 passengers and crew members on board survived the landing.\n",

Astronomers used Kepler telescope data to extrapolate the number of planets in the Milky Way.\n2. 22% of sun-like stars have potentially habitable planets.\n3. We need to assess the likelihood of two specific statements about Kepler's findings.\n\nFor option (a):\n- It's stated as a factual piece of information: \"Kepler has found 3,538 planet candidates to date.\"\n- This is a straightforward statement that could be directly based on data from the Kepler mission.\n\nFor option (b):\n- It adds an additional condition: \"Kepler has found 3,538 planet candidates to date to be mentioned in a popular science fiction novel.\"\n- This requires not just the finding of planet candidates but an additional, less certain event \u2014 that these findings are mentioned in a popular science fiction novel.\n\nGiven the above analysis:\n- The straightforward statement in (a) is based on specific, measurable data and does not require an additional, less certain condition.\n- The statement in (b) requires not only the findings but also an external event (being mentioned in a popular science fiction novel), which introduces more uncertainty.\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is:\n(a) Kepler has found 3,538 planet candidates to date.",
