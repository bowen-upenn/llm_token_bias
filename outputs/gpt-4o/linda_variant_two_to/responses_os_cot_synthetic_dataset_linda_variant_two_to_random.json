Assessing Option (a):\n   - \"IPCC says it is more certain than ever that humans are causing temperature rises.\"\n   - This statement aligns with the context of climate change and the urgency of addressing it.\n   - It directly relates to the scientific consensus on human impact on global temperatures, which is a central theme in climate change discussions.\n\n3.

Specificity and Plausibility:\n   - Option (a) describes Derek Ward's death as an apparent suicide by stepping in front of a train, which directly aligns with the concept of suicide due to despair or intent to end his life.\n   - Option (b) introduces an additional detail that he stepped in front of a train to pick up a dropped coin. This scenario is less likely as it involves an extra, specific motive that complicates the primary concept of an \"apparent suicide.\"\n\n3.

These are common international concerns among political leaders.\n   - **Relative Realism:** The idea that Botswana's leaders would take a stance on the outcome of an election in another country aligns with typical international diplomatic behavior.\n\n2. **Plausibility:**\n   - **Option (a):** It makes sense that if Botswana's leaders are concerned about the legitimacy of elections and regional stability, they might have had similar concerns previously, including Zimbabwe's elections.\n   - **Option (b):** The suggestion that Botswana's opposition to an election outcome is motivated by an aim to improve culinary skills is highly implausible and unrelated to political behavior or concerns about peace and security.\n\nGiven the analysis, option (a) describes a scenario that is consistent with typical diplomatic interests and actions, while option (b) introduces a highly unlikely and unrelated motive.\n\n**Therefore, the option more likely to be true is:**\n\n(a) The leaders of Botswana also opposed the outcome of Zimbabwe's elections two years ago.",

The song \"Vote However You Like\" suggests that they engaged in political or social commentary relevant to elections and voting.\n3. The phrase \"Dear Obama\" implies a direct address to former President Barack Obama, indicating a theme of offering advice or encouragement.\n4. Considering their previous song's focus on voting, it is reasonable to expect their next song might also focus on broad social or political issues.\n\nOption (a) states that the song \"Dear Obama\" offers general advice to the president. This is consistent with their previous themes around social involvement and political commentary.\n\nOption (b) states that the song \"Dear Obama\" specifically advises the president to invest in cryptocurrency. Given the context, this seems less aligned with their previous work. Additionally, the advice to invest in cryptocurrency is much more specialized and less likely to be a topic for a school performance, especially for younger children reflecting on broader social issues.\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is:\n(a) They have written another song, \"Dear Obama,\" which offers advice to the president.",
