Instead, parole is typically granted based on criteria related to the individual\u2019s behavior, sentence, and rehabilitation, not specifically to serve a direct police purpose.\n\nWith these considerations, it appears that the more likely option is:\n\n(a) Hubert, 27, was released on parole on May 23.",

This is a more specific claim and involves an additional layer of detail.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n- The introduction only mentions that the new iPhones offer bigger screens and new features.\n- Option (a) makes a general claim about games taking advantage of the larger screen, which aligns with the basic facts provided.\n- Option (b) goes further by suggesting exclusive gameplay enhancements for specific games, which are not mentioned in the introduction.\n\nConsidering the principle of parsimony (choosing the simpler explanation that requires fewer assumptions), the more likely option based on the given information is:\n\n(a) Games taking advantage of screen size will include Vainglory, Asphalt 8.\n\nIt is a more straightforward claim without needing additional assumptions about exclusive features.",

Option (b) specifies that the stringent security patrols are specifically to keep fans from visiting Michael Jackson's grave site.\n\n2. **Public Interest**: Michael Jackson is an extremely famous celebrity with a massive fan base. It's reasonable to assume that his grave would attract a lot of public and fan interest.\n\n3. **Security Measures**: Given the high-profile nature of Michael Jackson and the concerns of fans trying to visit his gravesite, it is plausible that the funeral company would implement stringent security measures specifically for his site to prevent disturbances, vandalism, or unauthorized access.\n\n4. **Employee Discretion**: The employees' reluctance to confirm whether Jackson's body is there can be seen as a measure to prevent the site from becoming an attractant, suggesting that specific security measures could be in place.\n\nConsidering these steps, the more specific statement (and thus more likely given the information) is:\n\n(b) Funeral company has stringent security patrol to keep fans from visiting Michael Jackson's specific grave site.",
