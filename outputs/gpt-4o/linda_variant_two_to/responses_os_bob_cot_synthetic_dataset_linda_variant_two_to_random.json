LZ Granderson is commenting on how GOP candidates are trying hard to appeal to their base by using extreme strategies. Examples given include:\n   - Gingrich playing the \"Washington\" card.\n   - Santorum calling Obama a \"snob\" regarding education.\n   \n2. Granderson opines that these efforts are extreme to the point of lunacy and not offering substantial reasons for voters to support them.\n\nGiven this context:\n\n- Option (a) states that the strategy of proving tea party credibility through extreme ways is backfiring, which aligns with the information provided. Granderson is critical of these extreme strategies and their potential ineffectiveness.\n  \n- Option (b) introduces an unrelated topic (cookie recipes) which has no connection to the context of GOP candidates' strategies or Granderson's critique.\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is:\n(a) Strategy of proving tea party cred in extreme ways is backfiring, Granderson says.",

This topic is highly relevant to discussions about child behavior and development.\n\n2. **Setting Appropriateness**: The statement attributed to the psychologist is a professional opinion likely given in a setting where child behavior and parental actions are the topics of focus. Such settings might include academic discussions, therapy sessions, or public talks about parenting strategies, rather than casual settings like a book club.\n\n3. **Relevance to Book Clubs**: A book club discussing a fantasy novel is an unlikely place to seriously discuss parental discipline strategies, as the focus would typically be on the content of the book, not on child psychology or behavior issues.\n\nTherefore, the most likely scenario is:\n(a) Without appropriate limits, a child's behavior will \"mushroom,\" she says.\n\nStep-by-step, we\u2019ve determined that the psychologist's comment is far more fitting in a professional or relevant context rather than in a casual book club meeting.",

This can lead to an increase in the number and intensity of hurricanes.\n\n2. **Visibility in Meteorological Studies:**\n   The second option suggests that the purpose of the increased storms is to achieve higher visibility in meteorological studies.

The victims were in northern Nigeria.\n\nLet's consider the likelihood based on these points:\n\n(a) The foreigners worked for a construction firm in northern Nigeria.\n- Northern Nigeria has been a region where many foreign construction firms operate for various infrastructure projects. This explanation aligns well with the presence of foreign workers in that area.\n\n(b) The foreigners worked for a construction firm in northern Nigeria to learn how to cook traditional Nigerian dishes.\n- While learning to cook traditional dishes can happen anywhere, it sounds highly unlikely that foreign workers from several countries would specifically go to northern Nigeria for that purpose. Particularly, it wouldn't make sense for them to be associated with a construction firm if their main goal was culinary training. The context of a militant attack also suggests something more aligned with typical business or developmental activities.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the more likely option is:\n(a) The foreigners worked for a construction firm in northern Nigeria.",

In this case, Patricia Ward was found beheaded, indicating a violent act possibly connected to Derek Ward.\n\n2. **Motivation for Suicide**: In typical murder-suicide cases, the individual responsible for the murder might take their own life out of guilt, fear of consequences, or other psychological factors.\n\n3. **Option (a) Analysis**: This scenario aligns with the context of murder-suicide. It plainly states that Derek Ward died by suicide, which is consistent with the typical motive and behavior described in murder-suicide situations without introducing extraneous or unlikely details.\n\n4. **Option (b) Analysis**: This scenario involves Derek Ward stepping in front of a train to pick up a dropped coin.
