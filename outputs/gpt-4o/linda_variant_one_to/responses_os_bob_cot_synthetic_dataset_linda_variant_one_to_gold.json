Since the new pants fit him perfectly, it is likely he would continue to wear them regularly.\n\n- **Option (b): Jordan would continue wearing the new pair of pants to work.**\n  This option is more specific and can be true, but it assumes Jordan needs to wear pants to work and there\u2019s no specific information indicating his work attire requirements.\n\nGiven that option (a) does not add any specific conditions and aligns more broadly with the given information, it is the more likely scenario:\n\nThe correct answer is (a) Jordan would continue wearing the new pair of pants.",

Consequently, Rick developed gingivitis while his siblings received the monetary rewards.\n\nGiven these points, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(a) Marty would likely increase the reward to motivate Rick to floss.\nThis option suggests that Marty may increase the reward specifically to encourage Rick to take up flossing.\n\n(b) Marty would likely increase the reward to motivate Rick to floss to avoid further dental issues like gingivitis.\nThis option suggests that Marty might increase the reward with the dual intent of motivating Rick to floss and preventing additional dental problems.\n\nWhile both options involve increasing the reward, the second option explicitly includes the consideration of preventing further dental issues, which is a logical motivation given Rick's current gingivitis.\n\nTherefore, the more comprehensive and likely option is:\n(b) Marty would likely increase the reward to motivate Rick to floss to avoid further dental issues like gingivitis.",

Instead of reporting the accident, he offered Kylie an option to settle directly by paying him $50.\n\n3. **Kylie's Fear**:\n   - Kylie is afraid of losing her new license.

Tom worked harder to improve his credit score afterward, showing that he took proactive steps to enhance his financial standing.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that Tom is someone who pays attention to his credit score and is willing to take action to improve it. This makes it likely that he would continue to monitor and improve his credit rating.\n\nHowever, option (b) includes an additional specific motivation: to ensure he could get even better loan conditions in the future. While this is a reasonable assumption given Tom's proactive behavior, it introduces additional detail.\n\nAccording to logical reasoning and probability principles, the more general statement (which doesn't add specific assumptions) is more likely to be true. Therefore, among the two options:\n\n(a) Tom would continue to monitor and improve his credit score.\n(b) Tom would continue to monitor and improve his credit score to ensure he could get even better loan conditions in the future.\n\nThe more likely scenario is:\n\n(a) Tom would continue to monitor and improve his credit score.",

Given his excitement, this is highly plausible.\n\nOption (b) suggests that Ted would take pictures of the newborn baby to share on social media. Ted's probable actions would include sharing pictures on social media as it's common practice in today's digital age for sharing happy news.\n\nWhile both options involve the action of taking pictures, Option (b) is slightly more specific and includes an additional step that relies on the assumption that Ted uses social media, which is very common but not as certain as the action of taking a picture itself.\n\nConsidering all this, the simpler action is capturing the moment through pictures. Hence, the more likely option is:\n\n(a) Ted would take pictures of the newborn baby.",

Since expanding one\u2019s repertoire is a natural part of continuing to practice and perform music, option (b) is a more specific and likely continuation of Pat's behavior based on his prior actions and success.\n\nTherefore, the correct and more likely option is:\n(b) Pat would likely continue practicing and performing music to expand his repertoire.",

This scenario focuses on the general action of depositing the money into his bank account.\n- Option (b) states that Fred would likely deposit the money from the sale with the specific intention of saving up for a vacation. This scenario is more specific and adds an additional layer of intent.\n\nIn terms of probability, option (a) is more likely because it is a broader statement and doesn't require the additional context of Fred intending to save for a vacation. Option (b) is more detailed and thus less probable because it combines two actions: depositing the money and saving specifically for a vacation.\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is:\n\n(a) Fred would likely deposit the money from the sale.",
