The team fought hard but ultimately lost in the final round of the playoffs.\n\n2. **Focus of the Question**: The question is asking about what the protagonist, who is presumably the best shooter with the ankle injury, would strive to do.\n\n3. **Analysis of Options**:\n    - **Option (a)**: The protagonist would strive to recover from the ankle injury.\n      - This option is broader and simply states that the protagonist would want to recover from the injury, which is a reasonable and likely goal for a professional athlete.\n    - **Option (b)**: The protagonist would strive to recover from the ankle injury to help his team in upcoming games.\n      - This option adds a specific motivation for the recovery: to help the team in future games. While this is a plausible and likely goal, it is more specific than just recovering from the injury in general.\n\n4. **Likelihood**:\n    - Both options are plausible, but option (a) is more general and thus more broadly likely. Option (b) includes a specific motivation that, while likely, narrows the context.\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is:\n\n(a) The protagonist would strive to recover from the ankle injury.",

This option gives a more detailed motivation for his actions based on the context that he experienced the benefits of a good credit score in his recent car purchase.\n\nGiven the pattern of Tom's behavior and the logical continuation of his proactive stance towards credit management, it is more likely that his motivation includes having better loan conditions in the future.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (b) Tom would continue to monitor and improve his credit score to ensure he could get even better loan conditions in the future.",

Given that he felt left out because his friends were watching Netflix on their tablets, it's reasonable to assume he might do the same to not feel left out anymore.\n\n2. **Option (b) states**: \"The protagonist, Christian, would likely watch Netflix on his new tablet to catch up with the latest TV shows and movies.\"\n   - This statement is more specific, adding the additional detail that Christian would watch Netflix specifically to catch up with the latest TV shows and movies. While it is possible, it is an additional assumption that isn't explicitly supported by the information given.\n\nWhen considering probabilities, we generally prefer the broader or less specific option because it has fewer conditions to be met. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) The protagonist, Christian, would likely watch Netflix on his new tablet.",

While this is plausible, it is a more specific inference about their motivation that is not explicitly mentioned in the original information.\n\nTaking the step-by-step analysis into account, option (a) is the more straightforward and likely scenario based on the information provided.\n\nThe correct answer is (a) The protagonist would start preparing for the next paper assignment.",
