This is one event.\n   - In option (b), there must be two conditions fulfilled: Marty increases the reward for Rick to floss and to specifically avoid dental issues like gingivitis.

It includes an additional detail about the specific reason for rehiring the cleaners, namely, to remove a grape juice stain. This makes (b) a conjunction of two events: recommending or rehiring the cleaner and doing so to remove a grape juice stain.\n\nAccording to the basic principles of probability, the probability of a conjunction of two events occurring (P(A and B)) is always less than or equal to the probability of either event occurring alone (P(A) or P(B)).\n\nIgnoring the details and focusing purely on the probabilistic model:\n\n- Option (a) covers a broader range of possible reasons for Jodie recommending or rehiring the cleaners, which could include any future need for cleaning services, not just a specific type of stain.\n- Option (b) restricts the scenario to a specific situation involving a grape juice stain, making the overall event (recommendation or rehiring specifically for grape juice) less probable.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Jodie might recommend the cleaners to others or rehire them in the future.",
