Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Single Event and Conjunction**:\n   - **Single event**: The captain finds another crew member to fix the loose board.\n   - **Conjunction**: The captain finds another crew member to fix the loose board **and** to celebrate the upcoming national holiday.\n\n2. **Evaluate Probabilities**:\n   - The probability (P) of the single event (finding a crew member to fix the loose board) is simply P(A).\n   - The probability of the conjunction (finding a crew member to fix the loose board and to celebrate the upcoming national holiday) is P(A and B). According to probability rules, P(A and B) \u2264 P(A).\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Because P(A and B) (fixing the board **and** celebrating the holiday) must be less than or equal to P(A) (just fixing the board), the single event is more likely than the conjunction of two events.\n\nTherefore, the more likely scenario is:\n\n(a) The protagonist, the ship captain, would likely find another crew member to fix the loose board.",

This is a single event and based on the given information, James's behavior aligns with this action since he is very focused on his dental hygiene.\n\n2. **Conjunction of Events (Option b)**: This option suggests two specific events happening together: \n   - James replaces his toothbrush regularly.\n   - James replaces his toothbrush to catch the latest sports scores.\n\nThe probability of two events occurring together (P(A and B)) is always less than or equal to the probability of either event occurring alone (P(A) or P(B)). Here, we must consider how likely it is that James not only replaces his toothbrush regularly but does so specifically to catch the latest sports scores. This scenario is necessarily less likely than the simpler scenario where he just replaces his toothbrush regularly.\n\nTherefore, by adhering to probabilistic reasoning and understanding that the conjunction of events cannot be more likely than a single event, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) James would likely replace his toothbrush regularly.",
