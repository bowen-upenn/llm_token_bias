This further emphasizes her eagerness to make a new friend.\n\n3. **Activity Likelihood**:\n   - When children become friends, their initial activities often involve general play, talking, or engaging in simple, enjoyable activities. Inviting a new friend over would typically involve common interests or general fun activities.\n\n4. **Specific Activity - Watching a Documentary**:\n   - Introducing a specific activity, such as watching a documentary about ancient civilizations, adds an extra layer to the scenario. While it's possible, it is less common for children to choose such specific and niche activities for initial playdates, especially in a general context of wanting to make a new friend.\n\nBased on the typical behavior of children and the information given:\n\n(b) The protagonist, Anne Marie, would likely invite the new girl to play at her house.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThis leads us to the answer that (a) The protagonist, Anne Marie, would likely invite the new girl to play at her house, is the more likely scenario.

Acknowledging the bird's presence shows that the candidate is engaged with the audience and aware of the situation, but it does not specify any further action beyond recognizing the bird.\n\nOption (b): This scenario adds another layer by involving a discussion about the candidate's upcoming policy changes in conjunction with acknowledging the bird. While it's possible that the candidate could use the situation as a segue into discussing policy changes, it is a more complex and specific action as it combines two elements: interacting with the unexpected event (the bird) and transitioning smoothly into policy discussion. This requires a higher level of assumption about the candidate's immediate reaction and strategic thinking in the moment.\n\nBased on the principle of parsimony (choosing the simpler and more direct explanation when multiple possibilities exist), option (a) is more likely since it involves a straightforward and common reaction to unexpected events during a speech without adding additional assumptions or actions.\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is:\n(a) The protagonist would likely continue with the speech while acknowledging the bird's presence.",

This incident left a scar on his cheek.\n3. There's no direct information provided about Tom's connection to computers or helping others with computer-related issues.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(a) Tom would likely tell the story of how he got his scar.\n- This is a straightforward outcome, where Tom shares the story of his injury if asked or if it's relevant in a conversation.\n\n(b) Tom would likely tell the story of how he got his scar to check if anyone needed help with their computer.\n- This option introduces a specific context (checking if anyone needs help with their computer) that is not supported by any information provided in the scenario.\n\nGiven the lack of context about Tom's involvement with computers or assisting others with computer issues, option (a) is the more likely scenario. The additional detail in (b) is not substantiated by the information given.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) Tom would likely tell the story of how he got his scar.",

There is no information provided that suggests the cleaners have any expertise in vacation planning or that Jodie would hire them for such a purpose.\n\nStep by step:\n1. Jodie hired a cleaning service for a specific cleaning task.\n2. The cleaners did a really good job.\n3. If their primary service is cleaning and Jodie needs cleaning services in the future, it's reasonable to recommend or rehire them for similar tasks, not unrelated tasks like vacation planning.\n\nThus, the more likely scenario is:\n\n(a) Jodie might recommend the cleaners to others or rehire them in the future.\n",

Scenario (a) involves fewer assumptions and stays consistent with the pattern of behavior already exhibited by Mark. \n- Introducing a completely new activity like learning the guitar, as in scenario (b), adds complexity and assumes a shift in focus, which is not supported by the given details.\n\nThus, it is more likely:\n\n(a) Mark would continue training to increase his pull-up count beyond ten.",
