Both actions are aimed at getting the computer, regardless of its specific use.\n\n2. **Option (b):** \"Ray might start looking for a less stressful job or explore alternative ways to earn or save money for the computer to better accommodate his need for a powerful gaming setup.\"\n   - This option includes all the actions in (a) but adds an additional specification that the computer is intended for a powerful gaming setup. This narrows down the scope of Ray's motivation and need.\n\nTo solve the problem correctly through the lens of probabilistic thinking:\n\n- Understand that adding additional details to an event (such as specifying the computer's use for gaming) makes it less probable because it introduces more conditions that must be satisfied.\n  \n- The likelihood of any specific action plus an additional condition (like purchasing the computer for gaming) is always less than or equal to the likelihood of the action without the additional condition.\n\nHence, **option (a)** is more probable because it involves fewer conditions and constraints than option (b). By keeping the scenario general and without specifying the use of the computer, it covers a broader range of possibilities.\n\nThe answer is:\n**(a) Ray might start looking for a less stressful job or explore alternative ways to earn or save money for the computer.**",

This is `P(A and B)`.\n\n4. **Understanding the Conjunction Fallacy:**\n   - The conjunction of two events (`P(A and B)`) cannot be more likely than one of the constituents (`P(A)`). By definition, `P(A and B) \u2264 P(A)`.\n\n5. **Removing Contextual Details:**\n   - We need to disregard the narrative details that might sway our intuition and focus purely on the form of the options.\n\nGiven these points, we conclude that it's inherently more likely for Kendall to regularly water and tend to her garden without any additional conditions attached.\n\nThus, the correct and more probable option is:\n\n(a) Kendall would regularly water and tend to her garden.",
