The fact that some items are rare does not imply that some books, which are a subset of items, are rare.

The subset of vehicles with four wheels generally refers to cars and similar road vehicles, not trains. The information provided about vehicles having four wheels cannot be directly applied to trains without additional premises confirming that trains specifically have or can have four wheels.
