The premises indicate that salts and peppers are condiments and that some condiments enhance flavor, but this does not necessarily mean that salts and peppers must be among those condiments that enhance flavor. There could be condiments that do not serve the function of flavor enhancement.\n\nThe logical flaw is a hasty generalization from the subset of condiments that enhance flavor to all salts and peppers enhancing flavor, without direct evidence linking salts and peppers specifically to that function.",
