This is a conjunction of two events occurring.\n\n3. **Compare the Probabilities:**\n   - According to the principle of the conjunction fallacy, the likelihood of a conjunction (A and B) is always less than or equal to the likelihood of a single event (A).\n   - Thus, celebrating an anniversary or organizing a family gathering by itself is more probable than celebrating an anniversary or organizing a family gathering specifically to introduce a new baby.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on probabilistic reasoning and avoiding the conjunction fallacy, we determine that:\n\n(a) The protagonist (Evan or April) would likely celebrate an anniversary or organize a family gathering\n\nis more likely than:\n\n(b) The protagonist (Evan or April) would likely celebrate an anniversary or organize a family gathering so that they can introduce their new baby to the extended family.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) The protagonist (Evan or April) would likely celebrate an anniversary or organize a family gathering.",

In other words, the probability of two events occurring together (repairing the car and driving it in spring/summer) is less than or equal to the probability of the single event (repairing the car) because the conjunction requires both to happen simultaneously.\n\nTherefore, based solely on probabilistic reasoning and ignoring any narrative biases:\n- Option (a) by itself has a higher probability.\n- Option (b) adds an additional condition and therefore has a lower probability.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Zack would likely repair or restore his car.",
