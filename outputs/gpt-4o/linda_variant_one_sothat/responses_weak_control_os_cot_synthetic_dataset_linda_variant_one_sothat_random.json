The probability of this happening depends on how likely it is for Tom to pay the fine after being ticketed. Let's assume this is a reasonably probable event.\n\n2. **Option (b)**: \"Tom would pay the ticket so that he could have dinner with his friends later that evening.\"\n\n   This scenario involves two events: Tom paying the ticket and Tom having dinner with his friends. For this scenario to occur, both events must happen. Since the probability of both events happening together (paying the ticket and having dinner) is typically lower than the probability of just one of them happening independently, this is less likely.\n\nIn summary, the individual event of Tom paying the ticket (Option (a)) is more probable than the combined events of Tom paying the ticket and having dinner with his friends (Option (b)).\n\nSo, the correct answer is (a) Tom would pay the ticket.",

There are no additional conditions or assumptions needed for this.\n\n- **Step 2**: Katherine buys coffee at Starbucks using the gift certificate and then watches the season finale of her favorite TV show later that evening.\n    - This scenario involves two events: buying coffee at Starbucks and watching the season finale of her favorite TV show. While it's possible that Katherine might do both things, this scenario adds an additional layer of specificity (watching the TV show) that makes it less probable than just buying coffee. \n\nIn probability theory, the likelihood of two events occurring together (a conjunction) is always equal to or less than the likelihood of either one occurring alone. Hence, option (a) is a subset of option (b), making it more probable.\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is:\n\n(a) Katherine would buy coffee at Starbucks using the gift certificate.",

This is a general outcome which is applicable to anyone moving into a new place.\n\n(a) The protagonist would likely start settling into their new living situation.\n- This is a general statement that follows logically from the situation. After moving out and living separately, it is reasonable to expect that the individual would begin to settle into their new environment.\n\n(b) The protagonist would likely start settling into their new living situation so that they can start collecting rare tropical fish.\n- This statement adds an additional, specific detail (starting to collect rare tropical fish) which has no prior context or indication from the information provided. While it is not impossible, it is a much less likely scenario simply because it is more specific and introduces a new element without any supporting context.\n\nThe principle of the conjunction fallacy tells us that the likelihood of two events occurring together (in conjunction) is always less than or equal to the likelihood of either one occurring alone. Therefore, adding more specific details generally reduces the probability.\n\nThus, the more likely option is:\n(a) The protagonist would likely start settling into their new living situation.",

The diet made her healthier and improved her mood. Jane is glad about the positive results of her hard work.\n\n2. **Option (a)**: States that Jane would continue following her low calorie diet. This follows logically from the given information: she has seen positive results from her efforts and is glad about them.\n\n3. **Option (b)**: States that Jane would continue following her low calorie diet so that she could start collecting rare stamps. This statement adds an additional, unrelated activity\u2014collecting rare stamps\u2014that is not mentioned or implied in the given information.\n\nThe task is to determine which is more probable. According to the conjunction rule in probability theory, the likelihood of two events occurring together (in conjunction) is always less than or equal to the likelihood of either event occurring alone. In this case:\n\n- The event of Jane continuing her diet (single event).\n- The event of Jane continuing her diet **and** starting to collect rare stamps (conjunction of two events).\n\nSince the question asks which is more probable, we compare:\n- (a) Jane continues following her low calorie diet.\n- (b) Jane continues following her low calorie diet so that she could start collecting rare stamps.\n\nFollowing the conjunction rule:\n\nThe correct answer is (a) Jane would continue following her low calorie diet.",

Each additional specific detail decreases the overall probability because it requires extra conditions to be true.\n\nGiven that adding more detail to an event typically makes it less probable than the simpler event, the more likely option is:\n\n(a) Terence would likely photograph or sketch the sunset.",

Therefore, option (a) includes two common activities that are very probable.\n   - Celebrating an anniversary or organizing a family gathering and adopting a new pet are two separate events combined. While celebrating an anniversary or organizing a family gathering is common, adding the adoption of a new pet makes it more specific and, hence, less probable than just celebrating or organizing alone, as it includes an additional condition.\n\n3. **Applying the Conjunction Fallacy:**\n   - The conjunction fallacy occurs when people incorrectly believe that the combination of two events is more likely than one of the events alone.\n   - In this scenario, option (b) combines two events, while option (a) lists them separately.\n\nSince the likelihood of just celebrating an anniversary or organizing a family gathering (option (a)) is higher than the likelihood of celebrating an anniversary or organizing a family gathering and adopting a new pet (option (b)), the correct answer is:\n\n(a) The protagonist (Evan or April) would likely celebrate an anniversary or organize a family gathering.",
