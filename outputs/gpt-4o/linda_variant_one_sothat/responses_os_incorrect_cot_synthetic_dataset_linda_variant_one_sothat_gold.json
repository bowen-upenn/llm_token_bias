It does not make any assumptions about Tom\u2019s motivations beyond compliance with the law.\n   - Option (b) involves paying the ticket with an additional specific intention, which adds an extra layer of assumption about Tom's thought process and future actions.\n\nSince option (a) is a simpler and broader statement that does not rely on additional assumptions, it is more likely.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is (a) Tom would pay the ticket.**",

This immediate enthusiasm suggests that Jackson enjoys writing about subjects he is interested in.\n  \n2. **Research and Effort**: Jackson put a lot of effort into his report by spending the entire weekend researching and even visiting the zoo. This indicates that he is willing to put in extra effort for topics he enjoys.\n  \n3. **Positive Outcome**: Jackson's paper received a fantastic grade and entertained his classmates. This positive reinforcement makes it likely that Jackson would want to repeat this successful experience.\n\nGiven these points, let\u2019s evaluate the options:\n\n- **Option (a)**: Suggests that Jackson might choose to write more reports on other animals or subjects he enjoys. This follows logically from his initial enthusiasm and the effort he put in.\n\n- **Option (b)**: Suggests that Jackson might write more reports on subjects he enjoys, with the added motivation of continuing to receive high grades and entertain his classmates. This option includes everything in (a) but adds the specific motivations of grades and entertainment.\n\nConsidering that positive reinforcement (high grades and entertaining his classmates) can be a strong motivator, it is logical to include these in his motivations.\n\nHowever, according to the principle of simplicity (Occam's Razor), the simplest explanation without unnecessary additional assumptions is usually better.

Teenagers often engage in impulsive actions for exciting experiences or social media opportunities.\n\nHowever, option (a) remains a broader category that doesn't confine the motivation to one specific action (getting a selfie).

However, (b) includes a specific goal (maintaining blood pressure levels for the long term).\n\n5. **Logical simplification:**\n   There's no additional assumption required for Stanley to seek managing his health proactively. In option (b), the added detail about long-term blood pressure maintenance logically follows from the desire to manage health proactively, but it introduces an extra specificity.\n\n6. **General likelihood:**\n   Option (a) is broader and simply states that Stanley will continue to manage his health.

However, the additional detail **\"so that he could receive compliments from his friends\"** adds an extra layer of motivation that isn\u2019t directly supported by the available information.\n\nTherefore, the correct and more likely option is:\n\n(b) Don would show off his new boots so that he could receive compliments from his friends. This option includes an assumption about Don's specific motives for showing off, which is not strictly derived from the information given.\n\nOn reconsideration, it becomes clear that the simpler option without additional unstated assumptions (a) is more plausible.

This is consistent with his love for horror and storytelling. Given that they are already staying up and the atmosphere is perfect for more stories, this behavior aligns with his interests and the setting.\n\nOption (b) suggests that Marshall would continue telling more horror stories to try to explain the strange sounds they heard. This builds on option (a) by adding a specific purpose to the storytelling \u2013 trying to explain the strange sounds. While this adds a layer of reasoning, it's not necessary to assume that Marshall's intention is to explain the sounds. He could simply want to continue the enjoyment of storytelling and the shared fright with his friends.\n\nTherefore, the additional detail about explaining the strange sounds in option (b) is not required to make sense of Marshall\u2019s likely actions. \n\nHence, the more likely option is:\n(a) Marshall would likely continue telling more horror stories to his friends around the campfire.",

While it is possible that Sally might consider her work schedule when deciding to seek medical attention, the primary motivation would still be to address the allergic reaction itself.\n\nGiven that option (a) focuses solely on the immediate and direct action of seeking medical attention due to the allergic reaction without assuming additional context, it is the more likely scenario based on the information provided.\n\nSo, the more likely option is:\n\n(a) Sally would seek medical attention for her allergic reaction.",

This suggests she was trying to avoid detection in the first place.\n\n2. **Parents' Reaction**: When Cara's parents found out, they were furious and grounded her for two months. This implies the severity of her actions in the eyes of her parents and likely consequences.\n\n3. **Possible Motivations for Apology**:\n    - (a) Cara might apologize to her parents for sneaking out. This option suggests she might apologize simply because she recognizes her wrongdoing and feels remorse.\n    - (b) Cara might apologize to her parents for sneaking out so that they might consider reducing her grounding period. This option suggests she might apologize with the additional motivation to possibly reduce the consequences of her actions.\n\nGiven these steps, while both scenarios are plausible, option (b) includes an additional motivation that is logical given the context. Cara recognizes that apologizing might also serve the purpose of reducing her punitive period, which seems like a likely consideration for someone who has been grounded for a significant amount of time.\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is:\n\n(b) Cara might apologize to her parents for sneaking out so that they might consider reducing her grounding period.",
