He bought the boots and wore them the next day, suggesting he was eager to use them right away.\n\nGiven these points:\n- Option (a) states that Don would show off his new boots. This is consistent with his excitement about acquiring the new boots and his decision to wear them right away.\n- Option (b) adds the specific motivation that Don wants to receive compliments from his friends. While this is possible, it introduces an additional layer of intent that is not explicitly mentioned in the scenario.\n\nTherefore, it is simpler and more directly supported by the information to state that Don would show off his new boots without assuming his motivation to receive compliments.\n\nSo, the more likely option is:\n(a) Don would show off his new boots.",
