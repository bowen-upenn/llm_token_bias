This is consistent with his background and interests.\n\n2. **Tony would attend a music concert so that he can review the latest smartphone models being used by concertgoers (b)**:\n   - While it's possible that Tony might have an interest in smartphones, this additional detail (reviewing the latest smartphones) introduces a specific condition that makes this scenario less probable than simply attending a music concert.

Option (b) describes a conjunction of two events: Tommy continuing to watch his new favorite shows *and* doing so to improve his cooking skills.\n\n2. **Probability of Single Event**: The probability of a single event (Tommy continuing to watch his new favorite shows) is generally higher than the probability of that event occurring along with an additional specific condition (improving his cooking skills).\n\n3. **Conjunction Fallacy**: According to the conjunction rule in probability theory, \\(P(A \\cap B) \\leq P(A)\\). This means that the likelihood of both A and B happening together is less than or equal to just A happening by itself.\n\nThus, the more likely option is:\n(a) Tommy would continue watching his new favorite shows.",

This is a straightforward, likely scenario given her situation.\n\n2. **Conjunction of Two Events (b)**: Kim would likely prepare for the arrival of her baby so that she could finish reading her favorite book.\n\n   This statement requires that both conditions are true: Kim would prepare for the arrival of her baby AND she has the specific motive of finishing reading her favorite book because of this preparation. This is a more specific scenario, thus less probable than a single condition.\n\nUsing the probabilistic approach:\n\n- The probability of a single event (preparing for the baby) is always higher than the probability of a conjunction of events (preparing for the baby and finishing a book).\n\nThus, the correct choice in terms of probability is:\n\n(a) Kim would likely prepare for the arrival of her baby.",
