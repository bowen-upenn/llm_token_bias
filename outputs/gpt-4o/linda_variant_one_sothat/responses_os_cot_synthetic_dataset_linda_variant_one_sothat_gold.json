It's a simple event.\n  \n- Option (b) is a more complex scenario. Not only does Tom have to pay the ticket, but he must also have the specific intention of avoiding further issues with his car stereo. This situation is more restrictive because it adds an extra layer of conditions.\n\nAs per the principles of probability, a single event (like paying the ticket) is more likely to happen than a conjunction of multiple events (paying the ticket and having a specific reason for it).\n\nTherefore, **(a) Tom would pay the ticket** is more probable.",

She felt very loved when she used the gift certificate.\n\nNow let's examine each option:\n\n(a) Katherine would buy coffee at Starbucks using the gift certificate.\n- This option aligns directly with the information provided. Katherine loves coffee, received a gift certificate for Starbucks, and used it the next day.\n\n(b) Katherine would buy coffee at Starbucks using the gift certificate so that she could share a relaxing moment with her friend who was visiting from out of town.\n- This option introduces an additional detail that is not mentioned in the original information: a friend visiting from out of town and sharing a moment. While it is possible, it adds extra elements that are not explicitly stated or implied.\n\nAccording to the principle of probability, a single event (such as Katherine buying coffee) is more probable than a combination of events (such as Katherine buying coffee and sharing a moment with a friend visiting from out of town).\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is:\n(a) Katherine would buy coffee at Starbucks using the gift certificate.",

While it's possible that Marshall might incorporate the strange sound into his storytelling, the additional purpose described here (explaining the sound) makes this scenario more specific and less likely than simply continuing to tell stories.\n\nAccording to probability theory and the principle of Occam's razor (which states that the simplest explanation is usually the correct one), the less specific scenario without the extra purpose is more likely.\n\nThus, the correct answer is (a) Marshall would likely continue telling more horror stories to his friends around the campfire.",

So I traded with her.** \n   - The friend is smaller, meaning a large shirt would be disproportionately bigger for her than for the protagonist.\n\nGiven the above points:\n\n- **If the protagonist and their friend both had large shirts**, the friend would definitely want a smaller-sized shirt that fits better, which is impossible here because only larges are available.\n\n- **The protagonist likely traded with their friend because they wanted a better fit**. Since the protagonist traded with someone smaller, it suggests they might receive a shirt that fits slightly better, but not perfectly.\n\nThus, the protagonist is more likely to wear a shirt that is generally too big for both parties but more manageable for the protagonist.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (a) The protagonist would likely wear a shirt that is too large for them.",
