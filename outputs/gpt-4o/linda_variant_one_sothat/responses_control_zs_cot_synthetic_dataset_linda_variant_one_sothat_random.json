We are comparing two scenarios:\n\n(a) Lilly would avoid roller coasters in the future.\n(b) Lilly would avoid roller coasters in the future so that she could spend more time reading books.\n\nLet's analyze these options step by step:\n\n1. **Focus on Single Events vs. Conjunctions**: \n   - Option (a) describes a single event: Lilly avoiding roller coasters in the future.\n   - Option (b) describes a conjunction of two events: Lilly avoiding roller coasters and spending more time reading books.\n\n2. **Probability of Single Events**:\n   - The probability of a single event (a) occurring is generally higher or equal to the probability of a conjunction of that event with another event (b). This is because for the conjunction to be true, both constituent events must occur.\n\n3. **Conjunction Fallacy**:\n   - Option (b) may seem more specific and thus more tempting, but judging it as more probable than (a) involves a conjunction fallacy. For (b) to be true, both \"avoiding roller coasters\" and \"spending more time reading books\" have to happen simultaneously, which is inherently less probable.\n\nConsidering these points:\n\n- Option (a) requires only one condition to be true: Lilly avoids roller coasters.\n- Option (b) requires two conditions to be true: Lilly avoids roller coasters and she spends more time reading books.\n\nTherefore, according to probabilistic reasoning and to avoid the conjunction fallacy, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Lilly would avoid roller coasters in the future.",
