Given that vomiting is a recognized symptom of hepatitis A, while a sudden interest in classical music is not, option (b) is more likely than option (a).\n\n5. Furthermore, option (a) contains an additional specific detail (sudden interest in classical music) compared to option (b).

It is a condition where bile flow from the liver is blocked, causing a buildup of bile acids in the liver and blood. This can lead to various symptoms.\n\n2. Common symptoms of Chronic cholestasis include:\n   - Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)\n   - Itchy skin\n   - Dark urine\n   - Pale stools\n   - Fatigue\n   - Abdominal pain\n   - Loss of appetite\n\n3. While headaches can occur in some cases, they are not a typical or frequent symptom of Chronic cholestasis.\n\n4. Loss of appetite, on the other hand, is a common symptom of Chronic cholestasis due to the buildup of bile acids affecting digestion and appetite.\n\n5.

Fatigue, on the other hand, is a very common symptom of Hepatitis C. It occurs in a majority of patients with this condition.\n\n4. The probability of two independent events occurring together (in this case, fatigue and photophobia) is always less than or equal to the probability of either event occurring alone. In other words, P(A and B) \u2264 P(A) and P(A and B) \u2264 P(B).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (b) Mark experiences fatigue.\n\nThe combination of fatigue and photophobia is less likely than fatigue alone, given that photophobia is not typically associated with Hepatitis C, while fatigue is a common symptom.",

Bladder discomfort is a common symptom of a UTI. As the infection causes inflammation and irritation in the bladder, discomfort or pain in the lower abdomen is often experienced.\n\n3. Insomnia, however, is not a typical symptom directly associated with UTIs. While the frequent urge to urinate during the night (nocturia) might disrupt sleep, insomnia itself is not a common direct consequence of a UTI.\n\n4. The additional information about the patient being a 60-year-old Asian woman doesn't significantly affect the likelihood of either option, as UTIs can affect people of all ages and ethnicities.\n\n5. Therefore, based on the typical symptoms of a UTI, bladder discomfort is more likely to be experienced than bladder discomfort and insomnia together.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (b) She experiences bladder discomfort.",
