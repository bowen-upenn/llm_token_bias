Dengue is a viral infection that causes flu-like symptoms, including high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pain, nausea, vomiting, and skin rash.\n\n2. Malaise, which is a general feeling of discomfort, weakness, or uneasiness, is a common symptom of Dengue fever.\n\n3. Toe numbness is not a typical symptom of Dengue fever. While rare neurological complications can occur, toe numbness is not specifically associated with Dengue.\n\n4. Casey's age, gender identity, and ethnic background do not significantly influence the likelihood of experiencing specific Dengue symptoms.\n\n5. Therefore, the more probable scenario is that Casey experiences malaise, which is a common symptom of Dengue, rather than the combination of malaise and toe numbness, as toe numbness is not typically associated with the disease.",

Nocturnal enuresis (bed-wetting) is not a typical symptom directly related to brain hemorrhages in adults.

Some studies estimate that up to 40% of people with migraines also experience depression.\n\n3) Insomnia is also a common comorbidity with both migraine and depression.

However, his age and ethnicity likely don't have a significant bearing on the type of allergic reaction he experiences. Allergies can affect people of all ages and backgrounds.\n\n2. Shivering is not a common symptom of allergic reactions. Typical allergy symptoms include itching, hives, swelling, rash, runny nose, watery eyes, and in severe cases, difficulty breathing (anaphylaxis).\n\n3. Indigestion is also not a typical symptom of an allergic reaction. Indigestion is more often associated with gastrointestinal issues or food intolerances rather than true allergies.\n\n4. The combination of shivering and indigestion seems even less likely to be caused by an allergy, as they involve different body systems (thermoregulation and digestion).\n\n5. Given that neither symptom is a classic presentation of an allergy, if we had to choose, shivering alone (b) seems more probable than the combination of shivering and indigestion (a). \n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and the typical presentation of allergies, option (b) \"He experiences shivering\" is more likely, although neither option represents common allergy symptoms.",

Common symptoms include shakiness, nervousness, sweating, chills, irritability, confusion, rapid heartbeat, and hunger.\n\n2. Palpitations, which are feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering or pounding heart, are indeed a common symptom of hypoglycemia due to the body's response to low blood sugar levels.\n\n3. Mydriasis (pupil dilation) is not typically associated with hypoglycemia. It is more commonly associated with conditions such as traumatic brain injury, drug use, and certain neurological conditions.\n\n4. Sam's age, gender identity, and ethnic background do not have a direct impact on the likelihood of specific hypoglycemia symptoms.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and the typical symptoms associated with hypoglycemia, the correct answer is:\n\n(b) Sam also experiences palpitations.\n\nPalpitations are more likely to occur with hypoglycemia than mydriasis, which is not typically associated with the condition.",

Bronchial Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways that causes recurring periods of wheezing, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and coughing.\n\n2. Fatigue is a common symptom associated with Bronchial Asthma. This is because during an asthma attack, the airways become narrowed and inflamed, making it harder to breathe. This extra effort to breathe can lead to feeling tired and weak.\n\n3. While headaches can occasionally be a symptom of severe asthma attacks due to lack of oxygen, they are not as commonly associated with Bronchial Asthma as fatigue is.\n\n4. The information that Kenji is a 49-year-old Asian man is not directly relevant to determining his likely symptoms, as Bronchial Asthma can affect people of all ages and ethnicities.\n\n5. Given that fatigue is a more common and directly related symptom to Bronchial Asthma compared to headaches, it is more probable that:\n\n   (b) He experiences fatigue.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the higher probability of fatigue being a symptom of Bronchial Asthma, the correct answer is (b) He experiences fatigue.",

It is a common cause of chronic neck pain.\n\n2. Cervical spondylosis can lead to a variety of symptoms, including:\n   - Neck pain\n   - Stiffness in the neck\n   - Headaches\n   - Weakness or numbness in the arms or hands\n   - Trouble walking, loss of balance\n\n3. While neck pain is the most common symptom of cervical spondylosis, not everyone with the condition experiences frequent headaches. Headaches can be a symptom, but they are not always present.\n\n4. Given the information provided, we can assume that the 61-year-old man likely has neck pain due to his cervical spondylosis diagnosis. However, we cannot assume he also has frequent headaches, as this is not a guaranteed symptom.\n\n5.

Jaundice (yellowish skin) is a common symptom of Hepatitis E, as the liver dysfunction leads to a buildup of bilirubin in the body.\n\n3. While headaches can occur in some cases of Hepatitis E, they are not as characteristic or frequently reported as jaundice.\n\n4. The conjunction fallacy states that the probability of two events occurring together (in \"conjunction\") is always less than or equal to the probability of either one occurring alone.\n\nTherefore, it is more likely that:\n\n(a) Along with Hepatitis E, Robert has yellowish skin.\n\nThis is because jaundice is a highly characteristic symptom of Hepatitis E, while headaches, though possible, are less common.

This is because the heart may not be able to pump blood as efficiently as before, leading to fluid buildup in the lungs and difficulty breathing.\n\n3. Frequent headaches, on the other hand, are not typically associated with heart attacks or their aftermath. While headaches can occur due to various reasons, they are not a characteristic symptom of a heart attack.\n\n4. The conjunction fallacy comes into play here. Option (b) seems more specific and detailed, which might make it appear more probable. However, adding an additional unrelated condition (frequent headaches) to a typical symptom (breathlessness) does not make the option more likely.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) She experiences breathlessness. This option is more probable as it describes a common symptom following a heart attack, without adding any unrelated conditions.",

However, headaches are already a primary symptom of Migraine, so stating it separately doesn't add new information. Nasal congestion is not typically associated with Migraine.\n\n3. Option (b) suggests that the man experiences headaches in addition to Migraine. As mentioned earlier, headaches are a core symptom of Migraine, so this statement is redundant.\n\n4.

Tinnitus, which is the perception of noise or ringing in the ears, is also a condition that can co-occur with migraines.
