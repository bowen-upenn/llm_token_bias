Without additional context, there isn't a clear reason to assume the primary motivation for indicting the stepmother would be to prevent her from influencing the grandmother's trial, which makes option (b) seem less likely based solely on the information given. More details would be needed to determine if (b) is actually the more probable scenario.",
