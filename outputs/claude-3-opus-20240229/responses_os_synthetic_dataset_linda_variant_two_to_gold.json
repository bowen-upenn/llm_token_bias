Companies often run promotions tied to charitable giving.\n\nSo while both are plausible responses by a competitor to Denny's free breakfast promotion, the added detail about charity fundraising in (b) makes it a more likely and fully-formed promotional plan than the more generic pancake giveaway described in (a).",
