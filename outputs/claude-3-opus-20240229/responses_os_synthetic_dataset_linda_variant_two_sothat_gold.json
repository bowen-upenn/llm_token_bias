However, rather than simply objecting to the provocation, the White House would probably use this opportunity to reaffirm the United States' stance on maintaining freedom of navigation in the region, which has been a point of contention with China. By emphasizing this commitment, the U.S. would send a clear message to Beijing and other nations in the area about its position on this important issue.",

The fact that the quake was centered more than 250 miles offshore provides a logical explanation for why only minor shaking was felt on land and no major damage was reported on Sumatra, despite the large magnitude. Statement (a) on its own doesn't explain the minor impact, while (b) connects the location of the quake to the limited effects observed. The conjunction fallacy makes (b) seem more probable, even though adding extra details actually makes a scenario less likely in purely logical terms.",
