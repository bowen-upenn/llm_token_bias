Option (a) states that in addition to the fungal infection, David experiences nodal skin eruptions and dry cough.

Option (b) states that David experiences nodal skin eruptions in addition to his fungal infection. Certain fungal infections, such as disseminated histoplasmosis or cryptococcosis, can cause skin nodules or lesions.\n\n4. The principle of probability suggests that the occurrence of two related events (fungal infection and skin nodules) is more likely than the occurrence of three events together (fungal infection, skin nodules, and dry cough), unless there is a strong causal link between all three.\n\n5. Given the information provided, there is no clear indication that the fungal infection, skin eruptions, and dry cough are necessarily related.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information and the principle of probability, option (b) \"He also experiences nodal skin eruptions\" is more likely than option (a).",

GERD is a digestive disorder where stomach acid frequently flows back into the esophagus, causing symptoms like heartburn and acid reflux.\n\n2. Common symptoms of GERD include:\n   - Heartburn (a burning sensation in the chest)\n   - Acid reflux (regurgitation of stomach acid into the throat)\n   - Difficulty swallowing\n   - Chest pain\n   - Hoarseness or sore throat\n   - Sensation of a lump in the throat\n\n3. While vomiting can occasionally occur with severe GERD, it is not as common as other symptoms like heartburn and acid reflux.\n\n4. Photophobia (sensitivity to light) is not a typical symptom of GERD. It is more commonly associated with conditions affecting the eyes or the nervous system, such as migraines or meningitis.\n\n5. The man's age and ethnicity do not significantly impact the likelihood of specific GERD symptoms, as the disorder can affect people of all ages and backgrounds.\n\nBased on the given information and the typical presentation of GERD, option (b) \"He experiences vomiting\" is more likely than option (a) \"He experiences vomiting and photophobia.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (b) He experiences vomiting.",
