Option (b) states two events: \n   - The White House said the incident was a provocation and raised an objection with Beijing. \n   - The purpose was to emphasize the U.S. commitment to maintaining freedom of navigation in the region.\n\n3. The probability of a single event (option a) is always higher than the probability of that same event occurring in conjunction with another specific event (option b).\n\n4. This is because for option (b) to be true, both the provocation statement/objection event AND the specific purpose must be true. Whereas for option (a), only the provocation statement/objection event needs to be true.\n\n5.
