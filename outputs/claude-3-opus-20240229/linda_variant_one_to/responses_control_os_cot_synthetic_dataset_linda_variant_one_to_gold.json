Option (a) says that Jordan would continue wearing the new pair of pants in general, without specifying any particular context or setting.\n\n2. Option (b) says that Jordan would continue wearing the new pair of pants specifically to work. This is a subset or more specific case of the general scenario described in option (a).\n\n3. Probabilistically, the likelihood of a general event (Jordan wearing the new pants in any context) will always be greater than or equal to the likelihood of a more specific event (Jordan wearing the new pants in a particular context, like work).\n\n4. This is because the specific event (wearing pants to work) cannot occur without the general event (wearing the pants) occurring, but the general event can occur without the specific event.\n\n5. Therefore, the probability of option (a) must be greater than or equal to the probability of option (b).\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, the correct answer is (a) Jordan would continue wearing the new pair of pants.

Gregory takes the pills given by Doctor Gemma.\n2. Gregory feels better soon after taking the pills.\n\nStep 3: Recall the basic probability rule: the probability of a conjunction, P(A and B), is always less than or equal to the probabilities of its constituents, P(A) or P(B).\n\nStep 4: Apply the probability rule to this problem. The probability of Gregory taking the pills (option a) is higher than or equal to the probability of Gregory taking the pills and feeling better soon (option b).\n\nTherefore, option (a) \"Gregory would take the pills given by Doctor Gemma\" is more likely than option (b) \"Gregory would take the pills given by Doctor Gemma to feel better soon.\"\n\nThe correct answer is (a).",

The question is asking us to compare the probability of two events:\n   (a) The protagonist developing software to address user issues\n   (b) The protagonist developing software to address user issues AND earning a significant income\n\n2.
