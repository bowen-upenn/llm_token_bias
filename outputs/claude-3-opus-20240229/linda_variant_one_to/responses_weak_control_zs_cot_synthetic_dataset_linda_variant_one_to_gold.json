It's reasonable to assume that Erin might want to share her accomplishment with others, possibly by taking a photo and sharing it online.\n\n3. Now, let's look at the two options:\n   (a) Erin might take a photo of the new skirt to share online.\n   (b) Erin might take a photo of the new skirt to share online to get feedback from her online sewing group.\n\n4. Option (b) is more specific than option (a). It includes all the elements of option (a) but adds an additional detail about getting feedback from an online sewing group.\n\n5. According to the conjunction fallacy, people tend to think that a more specific scenario is more likely than a more general one, even though in reality, the probability of two events happening together (a conjunction) is always less than or equal to the probability of either one occurring alone.\n\n6. Therefore, while option (b) might seem more plausible because it provides a specific reason for sharing the photo, option (a) is actually more likely, as it encompasses option (b) and any other reasons Erin might have for sharing the photo online.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (a) Erin might take a photo of the new skirt to share online.",

Option (a) states that the captain would likely find another crew member to fix the loose board. This seems like a reasonable and likely course of action for the captain to maintain the ship.\n\n3. Option (b) adds additional information that is not present in the original scenario - it mentions an \"ongoing storm\". The original text does not indicate any storm or adverse weather conditions.\n\n4. According to the conjunction fallacy, humans tend to think that specific conditions are more probable than general ones. However, probability theory states that the probability of two events occurring together (in \"conjunction\") is always less than or equal to the probability of either one occurring alone.\n\n5. In this case, option (b) is a more specific scenario than option (a), as it includes the additional condition of an ongoing storm.
