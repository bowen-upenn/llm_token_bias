Since the new pants fit well and Jordan is happy with them, it's very likely that he would continue wearing them in general, not just to a specific place like work.\n\n4. While Jordan might indeed wear the new pants to work, the information provided doesn't specifically mention anything about his work or dress code requirements.\n\n5. The fact that Jordan is happy with the new pants suggests he would wear them regularly, not just in one specific context.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, option (a) \"Jordan would continue wearing the new pair of pants\" is more likely than option (b) \"Jordan would continue wearing the new pair of pants to work.\" The key difference is that option (a) is a more general statement that aligns better with the situation described in the passage.",

Rick, her son, didn't think the nickel reward was sufficient and chose not to floss.\n\n3. As a consequence, Rick developed gingivitis while his siblings, who did floss, received cash rewards.\n\n4. Marty, as a mother, would likely be concerned about Rick's dental health and would want to find a way to motivate him to floss.\n\n5. Increasing the reward amount could be an effective way to encourage Rick to start flossing, as he previously thought the nickel wasn't enough.\n\n6. Moreover, the fact that Rick developed gingivitis would likely make Marty even more determined to find a solution to get him to floss and prevent further dental problems.\n\nTherefore, option (b) is more likely: Marty would likely increase the reward to motivate Rick to floss to avoid further dental issues like gingivitis. The additional context of Rick developing gingivitis makes this option more probable than option (a), which only mentions increasing the reward without the added concern of dental issues.",

While this is possible, the information provided does not explicitly indicate a strong desire to show off the car to friends beyond posting a selfie on Snapchat.\n\nBased on the given information, option (a) seems more likely. The protagonist's actions demonstrate an interest in the car, but there is no clear evidence to suggest that they would go as far as asking for a ride specifically to show it off to friends.

The severity of allergic reactions can vary from person to person and from incident to incident. Some allergic reactions can be mild, while others can be severe and even life-threatening.\n\n4. Given that Brody initially developed a rash, it's likely that his allergic reaction was not immediately severe. However, allergic reactions can worsen over time, especially if the person is continuously exposed to the allergen or if the initial reaction is not treated promptly.\n\n5. Seeking medical attention is generally recommended when an allergic reaction occurs, particularly if the person has a known allergy. This is because allergic reactions can be unpredictable, and it's better to err on the side of caution.\n\nBased on this analysis, I believe that option (b) is more likely: Brody's rash worsened to the point where he needed to seek medical attention.

Sam was walking down the road and sidewalk.\n2. Her heel got stuck in the grate.\n3. She couldn't pull the heel out and had to rip it off.\n4. Sam now needs to buy a new pair of shoes.\n\nStep 1: Sam's immediate need is to replace her damaged shoes.\nBased on the information provided, it's clear that Sam needs to purchase a new pair of shoes because her current pair is ruined.\n\nStep 2: Consider Sam's likely destination for shoe shopping.\nSince Sam needs to replace her shoes, the most likely place for her to go would be a shoe store. This is a common and logical choice for someone in need of new footwear.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the specificity of the options.\nOption (a) states that Sam would likely go to a shoe store, which aligns with the logical conclusion from Step 2. Option (b) also mentions going to a shoe store but includes additional specific details about the type of shoes Sam would look for (stylish, high-heeled shoes).\n\nConclusion:\nWhile both options mention Sam going to a shoe store, option (a) is more likely because it does not make any assumptions about the type of shoes Sam would prefer. The information provided does not give any insight into Sam's personal style preferences, so option (b)'s specificity about \"stylish, high-heeled shoes\" is not supported by the given information.\n\nTherefore, option (a) \"Sam would likely go to a shoe store\" is more likely based on the information provided in the question.",

Given his recent efforts to improve his score, this seems quite likely.\n\n5. Option (b) goes a step further, suggesting that Tom's motivation for continuing to monitor and improve his score is to ensure he can get even better loan conditions in the future. While this is possible, the information provided doesn't explicitly support this additional detail about his future motivations.\n\nTherefore, while both options are plausible, option (a) is more directly supported by the information provided. Tom's recent experience and efforts suggest he would likely continue monitoring and improving his credit score, but the given information doesn't necessarily imply he's doing so specifically for better future loan conditions.\n\nIn conclusion, option (a) is more likely based on the given information.",

Once he has proven his innocence and been released, the innocent twin may then consider seeking redress for the wrongful accusation and detainment. This could involve:\n   - Filing a lawsuit against the store for wrongful imprisonment, defamation of character, mental anguish, etc.\n   - Seeking a settlement or damages to compensate him for the ordeal\n   - Demanding an apology and steps to prevent similar mistakes in the future\n\n4.

Pat brought his own guitar to the show, suggesting he owns the instrument and likely plays it regularly.\n\n4. He performed the song to a happy crowd, implying that his performance was well-received and successful.\n\nGiven these points, it's clear that Pat has an interest in music and performing. The positive experience at the talent show would likely encourage him to continue pursuing this interest.\n\nNow, let's compare the two options:\n\n(a) Pat would likely continue practicing and performing music.\n(b) Pat would likely continue practicing and performing music to expand his repertoire.\n\nWhile both options suggest that Pat would continue with music, option (b) goes a step further by suggesting that he would actively work on expanding his repertoire. However, the information provided doesn't explicitly mention anything about Pat's intention to learn more songs or expand his repertoire.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, option (a) is more likely, as it aligns directly with the details provided in the question without making additional assumptions.",

This incident clearly demonstrates the consequences of not wearing glasses while driving, as it directly led to him getting lost.\n\n3.

It's likely that Striker would be drawn to further explore and develop this skill.\n\n3.

Given Striker's academic struggles, it may be more difficult for him to pursue the necessary education to become a professional cartographer.\n\n5.

Doctor Gemma, after assessing Gregory's condition, prescribes him some pills to help him feel better.\n\nNow, let's compare the two options:\n\n(a) Gregory would take the pills given by Doctor Gemma.\n- This statement is likely true because Gregory sought medical help for his illness, and it's reasonable to assume that he would follow the doctor's advice and take the prescribed medication.\n\n(b) Gregory would take the pills given by Doctor Gemma to feel better soon.\n- This statement adds the additional information that Gregory would take the pills with the intention of feeling better soon.\n- It's a natural assumption that when a patient takes prescribed medication, they do so with the hope and expectation of feeling better as quickly as possible.\n\nWhile both statements are likely to be true, option (b) provides more specific information about Gregory's motivation for taking the pills. Therefore, based on the given information, option (b) is more likely than option (a).",

He stayed out one autumn night with his sheep, indicating that he is dedicated to protecting them.\n\n3. When he heard wolves howling in the distance, he went to investigate the noise. This shows that he is proactive in identifying potential threats to his sheep.\n\n4. Upon seeing a wolf, he shot his rifle at it.

When someone puts that much work into a garden, they are likely to continue taking care of it regularly to maintain its health and appearance. This would involve tasks like watering, weeding, pruning, etc.\n\n3. Attracting butterflies and hummingbirds is a specific gardening goal that requires additional planning and effort, such as selecting particular plants that appeal to these creatures. While this is possible, it is a more specialized interest that not all gardeners necessarily have.\n\n4. The passage doesn't provide any information to suggest Kendall had the specific intention of attracting butterflies and hummingbirds. It only tells us she wanted to plant a garden in general.\n\n5. Therefore, while both scenarios are possible, the one that aligns most closely with the given information is that Kendall would regularly water and tend to her garden to keep it healthy and blooming.\n\nSo based on the information provided, option (a) \"Kendall would regularly water and tend to her garden\" is more likely than option (b) \"Kendall would regularly water and tend to her garden to ensure it attracted butterflies and hummingbirds.\"",

This is a reasonable assumption because:\n   - People often share stories about significant events in their lives, especially those that leave physical marks like scars.\n   - The story of the accident is unusual and dramatic, making it an interesting tale to recount.\n\n3. Option (b) adds the detail that Tom would tell the story specifically to impress his friends during a gathering.

This aligns with his demonstrated ability to set and achieve fitness goals. However, it does not specify a new target number of pull-ups.\n\n3. Option (b) also states that Mark would continue training to increase his pull-up count beyond ten, but it specifically mentions a new goal of twenty pull-ups. Setting a new, higher goal after achieving the initial target is a common practice among individuals who are dedicated to their fitness journey.\n\n4. Given Mark's determination and the fact that he has already succeeded in doubling his initial pull-up count from five to ten, it is reasonable to assume that he would set a new, more challenging goal for himself.\n\n5.
