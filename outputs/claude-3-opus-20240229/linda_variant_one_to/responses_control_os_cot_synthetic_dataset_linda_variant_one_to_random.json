The background information tells us that Pat practiced a song, brought his guitar, and performed it to a happy crowd at a talent show. This suggests Pat has an interest and some skill in music.\n\n2. Option (a) states that Pat would likely continue practicing and performing music. This logically follows from the background information. If Pat enjoyed performing and the crowd was happy, it's reasonable to think he would continue with this activity.\n\n3. Option (b) introduces a conjunction - it states that Pat would continue practicing and performing music to improve his cooking skills. There is no information in the background to suggest Pat has an interest in cooking or that music would help improve cooking skills. \n\n4. Introducing this additional, unrelated element (cooking) makes option (b) less probable than option (a), which only involves one activity that Pat is known to have engaged in.\n\n5. Therefore, based on the probability rule that the conjunction of two events is always less than or equal to the probability of either event alone, option (a) is more likely.\n\nSo, the answer is (a) Pat would likely continue practicing and performing music.",

This is consistent with her current behavior and feelings towards Jake.\n\n3. Option (b) also states that Maria might ignore Jake's further attempts to contact her, but adds an additional condition - that she does so to learn more about a new recipe she found online.\n\n4. Probabilistically speaking, the likelihood of Maria ignoring Jake's attempts to contact her (a single event) is higher than the likelihood of Maria ignoring Jake's attempts to contact her AND learning about a new recipe online (a conjunction of two events).\n\n5. The additional information about the recipe in option (b) is extraneous and does not affect the probability of Maria ignoring Jake. It's an unnecessary detail that creates a conjunction fallacy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) Maria might ignore Jake's further attempts to contact her.

Option (a) involves a single event - Gregory taking the pills. Option (b) involves a conjunction of two events - Gregory taking the pills AND using them to organize his bookshelf.\n\n3.
