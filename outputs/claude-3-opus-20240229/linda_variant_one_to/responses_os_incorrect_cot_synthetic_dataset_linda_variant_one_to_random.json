This suggests he needed new, better-fitting pants.\n\n2. Jordan bought a new pair of bigger pants that fit him perfectly. He was happy with these new pants that were no longer too tight on him. \n\n3. Given Jordan is happy with the fit of the new pants, it's very likely he would continue wearing them in general, not just to a specific event like a musical concert.\n\n4. While it's possible Jordan might wear the new pants to a concert, the information provided doesn't mention anything about Jordan going to concerts or his musical interests.\n\n5. The passage focuses on Jordan's need for new pants that fit well due to his weight gain, and his satisfaction with the new pants he bought.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, option (a) \"Jordan would continue wearing the new pair of pants\" is more likely than option (b) \"Jordan would continue wearing the new pair of pants to a musical concert\". The key point is that Jordan would likely keep wearing the pants in general, not limited to a specific occasion like a concert which isn't mentioned in the context provided.",

She offered a nickel per day for flossing.\n3. Her son Rick didn't think the nickel reward was enough, so he didn't floss.\n4. As a result, Rick's siblings got cash rewards, while he ended up with gingivitis (gum disease).\n\nNow, let's look at the two options:\n\n(a) Marty would likely increase the reward to motivate Rick to floss.\n- This option makes sense because Marty's goal is to get her children, including Rick, to floss their teeth.\n- Since the current reward wasn't enough to motivate Rick, it's reasonable to think Marty would increase the reward to encourage him to floss.\n\n(b) Marty would likely increase the reward to motivate Rick to floss to watch more television.\n- This option doesn't make much sense based on the information provided.\n- The story doesn't mention anything about television or a connection between flossing and watching TV.\n- Marty's primary goal is to get her children to floss, not to encourage more TV watching.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and logical reasoning, option (a) is more likely: Marty would likely increase the reward to motivate Rick to floss.",

The question presents two options about what the protagonist is likely to do after seeing the restored 1965 Mustang.\n\n2. Based on the information provided, we know that the protagonist was curious about the covered car and excited enough about seeing the Mustang to take a selfie and post it on Snapchat. This suggests an interest in the car itself.\n\n3. Option (a) aligns with the protagonist's demonstrated interest in the Mustang. Asking the owner for a ride would allow the protagonist to experience the car firsthand and learn more about it.\n\n4. Option (b) introduces the idea of learning about astrophysics, which is not mentioned in the original text. There is no clear connection between the protagonist's interest in the Mustang and a desire to learn about astrophysics.\n\n5. Given the context provided, it is more likely that the protagonist's actions would be driven by their interest in the Mustang itself, rather than an unrelated subject like astrophysics.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given and the logical connection between the protagonist's interest and actions, option (a) is more likely: The protagonist would likely ask the owner for a ride in the Mustang.",

She entered a voice competition on TV, showing that she stepped out of her comfort zone to compete at a higher level.\n\n4. Despite singing the best she could, her clip was shown as a blooper, which likely means she made a mistake or had an embarrassing moment during her performance.\n\nNow, let's consider the two options:\n\n(a) Amelia would likely stop competing in singing competitions.\n- Given the embarrassing experience on TV, it's understandable that Amelia might feel discouraged and decide to stop competing in singing competitions.\n- Since she initially sang for fun, the negative experience could lead her to return to singing as a hobby rather than a competitive pursuit.\n\n(b) Amelia would likely stop competing in singing competitions to learn how to paint.\n- While the embarrassing experience might lead Amelia to stop competing in singing competitions, there is no indication in the given information that she has an interest in painting.\n- Switching to a completely different artistic pursuit seems less likely based on the provided context.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, option (a) is more likely: Amelia would likely stop competing in singing competitions.",

Hurricanes are severe and potentially dangerous storms, especially in coastal areas.\n\n3. The question asks what Kim, the protagonist, is more likely to do in this situation.\n\n4. Option (a) states that Kim would likely prepare for evacuation or seek shelter. This is a logical response to the news of an approaching hurricane. Evacuation orders are common in such situations, and seeking shelter is a wise precaution if evacuation isn't possible or necessary.\n\n5. Option (b) also mentions Kim preparing for evacuation or seeking shelter, but adds the detail \"to catch up on reading a new book.\" While reading a book could be a way to pass time while sheltering, it's not likely to be a primary motivation for seeking shelter in a hurricane situation.\n\n6. The hurricane ultimately passes by without hitting them, but this outcome was unknown to Kim at the time she needed to make a decision.\n\nGiven the severity of the situation and the potential danger posed by a hurricane, option (a) is more likely. The primary concern in such a scenario would be safety, rather than leisure activities like catching up on reading. Therefore, the most likely course of action for Kim would be (a) to prepare for evacuation or seek shelter.",

After such an encounter, it's natural that Sue's primary concern would be to check if she was stung by any of the bees during her escape. Bee stings can be painful and potentially dangerous, especially if Sue is allergic to bee venom.\n\n4. Checking her shoes to see if they are still tied is a much lower priority in this situation. While running, her shoelaces could have come untied, but that is a minor issue compared to the potential of being stung multiple times by angry bees.\n\n5.

It's unlikely that someone would go to a shoe store specifically to buy a cup of coffee, especially when they need new shoes.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and logical reasoning, the most likely answer is (a) Sam would likely go to a shoe store.",

The day before the marathon, Kevin discovered a painful blister on his foot, which made it difficult for him to jog. This blister is likely a result of the intense training he had been doing.\n\n3.

A date in this context usually refers to a social meeting between two people who are interested in a romantic relationship.\n\n4.

As a sheep owner, it's reasonable to assume that he would want to protect his sheep from potential threats, such as wolves.\n\n2. Joe stayed out one autumn night with his sheep, which suggests that he is dedicated to ensuring their safety.\n\n3. When Joe heard wolves howling in the distance, he went to investigate the noise. This action demonstrates his proactive approach to protecting his sheep.\n\n4. Upon seeing a wolf, Joe shot his rifle at it. This action directly shows his willingness to defend his sheep from the wolves.\n\n5. There is no mention of a local festival or any celebration in the given context.\n\nBased on the information provided and the logical steps, it is more likely that:\n\n(a) Joe would protect his sheep from the wolves.\n\nThe additional detail in option (b) about celebrating a local festival is not supported by the given context and seems less relevant to Joe's actions and motivations as a sheep owner facing a potential threat from wolves.",

The fact that the garden was \"blooming healthily in no time at all\" suggests that Kendall is dedicated to maintaining her garden.\n\n3. Option (a) states that Kendall would regularly water and tend to her garden, which is consistent with the information provided and the logical assumption that someone who puts a lot of effort into creating a garden would also take care of it.\n\n4. Option (b) introduces an unrelated skill - playing the violin - which has no connection to the context of Kendall's garden. There is no information provided that suggests Kendall is interested in or plays the violin.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and logical reasoning, option (a) is more likely: Kendall would regularly water and tend to her garden.",

The bird flew up to the podium, causing the crowd to cheer.\nWhich is more likely?\n(a) The protagonist would likely continue with the speech while acknowledging the bird's presence.\n(b) The protagonist would likely continue with the speech while acknowledging the bird's presence to discuss his upcoming policy changes.",

The presidential candidate is in the middle of giving a speech when a bird appears on stage and flies to the podium, distracting the crowd.\n\n2. As a seasoned public speaker, the candidate would likely try to maintain his composure and continue with the planned speech. Ignoring the bird entirely might seem odd or stiff.\n\n3. Acknowledging the bird's presence briefly with a lighthearted comment could help the candidate connect with the audience and appear more relatable. It shows he can adapt to the unexpected.\n\n4. However, discussing upcoming policy changes at that moment would be an abrupt change of topic. It risks confusing the audience or seeming like he's trying too hard to force the speech back on track.\n\n5. The best approach would be a brief, charming acknowledgement of the bird to put the crowd at ease, perhaps with a quip or joke, before smoothly transitioning back to his main speech topics.\n\nTherefore, option (a) is more likely - the candidate would probably continue with the speech as planned while briefly acknowledging the bird's presence to connect with the audience. But he would refrain from launching into complex policy discussions at that moment.",

Tom was injured by a piece of metal near a construction site, resulting in a scar on his cheek.\n2. The injury was significant enough that a doctor had to remove the metal shrapnel from Tom's face.\n3. The scar is still visible on Tom's cheek, indicating that it was a memorable and possibly traumatic event.\n\nNow, let's consider the two options:\n\n(a) Tom would likely tell the story of how he got his scar.\n- Given the unusual and potentially dramatic nature of the incident, it's reasonable to assume that Tom would share this story with others when asked about his scar.\n- People often share stories of significant events or injuries in their lives, especially when there is a visible reminder like a scar.\n\n(b) Tom would likely tell the story of how he got his scar to check if anyone needed help with their computer.\n- There is no clear connection between Tom's injury story and offering help with computers.\n- It seems unlikely that Tom would use his scar story as a segue to inquire about computer assistance, as the two topics are unrelated.\n\nBased on the information provided and the reasoning above, option (a) is more likely. Tom would probably share the story of how he got his scar when asked about it, given the memorable nature of the event and the visible reminder on his face.",

This logically follows from the information provided in the passage.\n\n3. Option (b) also suggests that Jodie might recommend the cleaners or rehire them, but it adds \"to plan her next vacation.\" However, there is no mention of vacation planning in the passage, and cleaners are typically not hired for vacation planning purposes.\n\nTherefore, option (a) is more likely, as it aligns with the information provided in the passage. The cleaners did a good job cleaning up the spilled grape juice, so it is reasonable to assume that Jodie would recommend them or rehire them for future cleaning needs.",
