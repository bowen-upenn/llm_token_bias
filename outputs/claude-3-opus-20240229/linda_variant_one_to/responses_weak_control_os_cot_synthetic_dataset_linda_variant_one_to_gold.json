The difference is that option (b) adds the additional reason of wanting to avoid further dental issues like gingivitis.\n\n2. Option (a) is more probable because it represents a single, straightforward motivation for Marty to increase the reward - to get Rick to start flossing like his siblings. This alone is a sufficient reason.\n\n3. Option (b), while plausible, is less likely because it is more specific. It assumes Marty's motivation includes not just wanting Rick to floss, but to do so specifically to avoid further dental problems. While this may be part of her reasoning, it's an additional assumption beyond what's needed to explain her likely action.\n\n4. In problems like this, the more general description of events is usually more probable than a more specific one. The specific description isn't wrong per se, but it's less likely to be the best answer compared to the more general case.\n\nTherefore, I would conclude that (a) \"Marty would likely increase the reward to motivate Rick to floss\" is the more likely scenario.

The protagonist is more likely to make another healthy breakfast using the eggs in general, rather than specifically making an omelette.",

It's reasonable to think Erin might want to share a photo of her accomplishment, as many people do in the age of social media. So option (a) seems quite likely.\n\n3. Option (b) is more specific - it posits that not only will Erin share a photo, but she'll do so with a specific group (her online sewing group) for a specific reason (to get feedback).\n\n4. While option (b) is certainly possible, it's a more specific scenario than option (a). Option (a) only requires that Erin decides to share a photo, while (b) requires that plus the specifics of who she shares it with and why.\n\n5. In probability, a more general scenario is always at least as likely, if not more likely, than a more specific version of that scenario. The specific scenario has additional conditions that need to be met.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) Erin might take a photo of the new skirt to share online.

While both options involve an apology, option (b) is a more specific subset of option (a). Every instance of (b) is also an instance of (a), but not vice versa.\n\n7. Therefore, option (a) is more probable, as it encompasses all possible apologies, including those made to ensure no hard feelings.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is (a) Dan would apologize to Joe. This is because (a) is a more general statement that includes the specific case mentioned in (b). The probability of a general statement is always greater than or equal to the probability of a more specific statement that falls within it.",

Everyone who visits a fair to ride more rides (option b) also visits a fair (option a). However, not everyone who visits a fair (option a) necessarily does so to ride more rides.\n\n5.

In the given scenario, Ted is excited about becoming an uncle and is visiting his sister and her newborn baby at the hospital.\n\n2. It is very common for people to take pictures of newborn babies, especially when they are close family members like an uncle. So, the probability of Ted taking pictures of the baby is quite high.\n\n3. Sharing pictures on social media is also a common practice, but not everyone does it. Some people prefer to keep family moments private or share them only with close friends and family through other means (e.g., private messaging or in person).\n\n4. The probability of Ted taking pictures of the baby (option a) includes both the scenarios where he shares the pictures on social media and where he doesn't. In other words, option (b) is a subset of option (a).\n\n5. Therefore, the probability of Ted taking pictures of the baby (option a) will always be greater than or equal to the probability of Ted taking pictures of the baby and sharing them on social media (option b).\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is (a) Ted would take pictures of the newborn baby. This is more likely than option (b), which is a more specific scenario that includes both taking pictures and sharing them on social media.",
