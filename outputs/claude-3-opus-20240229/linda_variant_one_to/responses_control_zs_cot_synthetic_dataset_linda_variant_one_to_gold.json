The question presents two possibilities: \n   (a) The protagonist asks the owner for a ride in the Mustang.\n   (b) The protagonist asks the owner for a ride in the Mustang to show it off to friends.\n\n2. Option (a) involves a single event - the protagonist asking for a ride in the restored Mustang. This is a simple, standalone possibility.\n\n3. Option (b), on the other hand, is a conjunction of two events - the protagonist asking for a ride AND the purpose being to show off the car to friends. It's a compound scenario.\n\n4. According to probability theory, the probability of a single event is always higher than or equal to the probability of a conjunction of events. In other words, P(A) \u2265 P(A and B).\n\n5. Therefore, without any additional information to suggest otherwise, we should assume that the single event in option (a) is more probable than the compound event in option (b).\n\nSo, the most likely answer is (a) - The protagonist would likely ask the owner for a ride in the Mustang.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the principle of the conjunction fallacy. We should resist the temptation to choose the more detailed or narrative-fitting scenario and instead rely on the fundamental rules of probability.",

We are presented with two options:\n   (a) Sam going to a shoe store\n   (b) Sam going to a shoe store specifically to find stylish, high-heeled shoes to replace the ruined ones\n\n2. Option (b) is a more specific version of option (a). It includes additional conditions (stylish, high-heeled shoes) beyond just going to a shoe store.\n\n3. In probability, the likelihood of a conjunction of events (A and B) is always less than or equal to the probability of each individual event (A or B). This is because for the conjunction to be true, both A and B must be true, which is a stricter requirement than just one being true.\n\n4. Applying this principle, the probability of Sam going to a shoe store AND looking for stylish, high-heeled shoes (option b) must be less than or equal to the probability of Sam simply going to a shoe store (option a).\n\n5. The additional details in option (b), while potentially relevant to Sam's story, do not increase the probability.

The question is asking us to compare the likelihood of two events:\n   (a) Erin might take a photo of the new skirt to share online.\n   (b) Erin might take a photo of the new skirt to share online to get feedback from her online sewing group.\n\n2. Event (a) is a single event: Erin taking a photo of the skirt to share online.\n\n3. Event (b) is a conjunction of two events: Erin taking a photo of the skirt to share online AND doing so specifically to get feedback from her online sewing group. This is a more specific case of event (a).\n\n4. According to the rules of probability, the probability of a single event is always greater than or equal to the probability of a conjunction of that event with another event. In other words, P(A) \u2265 P(A and B).\n\n5. Therefore, without needing to consider the background information about Erin's sewing skills or her feelings about the skirt, we can determine that event (a) is more likely than event (b), as (a) is a single event and (b) is a conjunction of events.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (a) Erin might take a photo of the new skirt to share online.",

Next, let's abstract the problem from its narrative context.
