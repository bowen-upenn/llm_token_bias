According to the given information, Eric has high functioning autism and sometimes experiences intense anger that can be different from how most people handle anger.\n\n2. Option (a) states that \"Eric might seek a quiet, isolated place to calm down.\" This aligns with a common coping strategy for individuals with autism who experience sensory overload or intense emotions. Seeking a calm, quiet environment can help them regulate their emotions and reduce stress.\n\n3. Option (b) also mentions that \"Eric might seek a quiet, isolated place to calm down,\" but adds \"to watch the sunset.\" While watching a sunset could be calming, the additional detail is not directly relevant to the information provided about Eric's autism and anger management.\n\n4. The passage does not mention anything about Eric's specific interest in sunsets or using them as a calming technique.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the step-by-step analysis, option (a) is more likely than option (b). The key difference is that option (a) focuses solely on seeking a quiet, isolated place to calm down, which is a more common coping strategy for individuals with autism who experience intense anger, while option (b) adds an extra detail that is not supported by the provided context.",

It's a secondary consideration that the manager might pursue after addressing the more pressing issues.\n\n(5) Therefore, option (a) is more likely - that the protagonist, as the new manager, would prioritize improving the efficiency of the post office operations.\n\nSo, based on this step-by-step analysis, I choose option (a) as the more likely scenario: The protagonist would likely improve the efficiency of the post office operations.",

Option (a) suggests that Ben would postpone the training session for another day, likely because he is tired from the earlier activities with the puppy.\n\n4. Option (b) also suggests that Ben would postpone the training session, but adds an unusual reason: to rearrange his sock drawer.\n\n5. Rearranging a sock drawer is a very specific and seemingly unrelated task to the situation at hand. It's unlikely that someone would prioritize this over resting when they are exhausted.\n\n6. On the other hand, postponing the training session to another day because of exhaustion is a more reasonable and likely response.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and logical reasoning, option (a) is more likely: Ben would postpone the training session for another day, as he is exhausted from the earlier activities with the puppy.",

On the first day of school this year, Adam surprised everyone by coming to school with a haircut.\n\n3. The fact that everyone was shocked suggests that Adam's new haircut was a significant change and unexpected.\n\n4. When someone makes a drastic change to their appearance, especially something they were known for, it often elicits reactions and attention from others.\n\n5. Option (a) directly relates to the story, as it mentions Adam enjoying the attention and reactions from his peers, which is a likely outcome of his dramatic haircut.\n\n6. Option (b) introduces a new element, the cafeteria menu, which is not mentioned in the story and seems irrelevant to Adam's haircut and the reactions it caused.\n\nBased on the given information and the step-by-step analysis, the most likely answer is (a) Adam would likely enjoy the attention and reactions from his peers.",

The fact that Joe stayed out at night with his sheep suggests he is vigilant and takes the safety of his flock seriously.\n\n3. Upon hearing wolves howling, Joe proactively went to investigate the noise, indicating his concern for the potential threat to his sheep.\n\n4. When Joe saw a wolf, he took immediate action by shooting at it with his rifle, demonstrating his willingness to defend his sheep against predators.\n\n5. The given information does not mention anything about a local festival or Joe's intention to protect his sheep for such an event.\n\nConsidering these points, it is more likely that:\n\n(a) Joe would protect his sheep from the wolves.\n\nThis conclusion is based on Joe's actions and his role as a sheep owner, which naturally entails protecting his flock from threats such as wolves. The additional detail about a local festival is not supported by the information provided in the question.",

This indicates she is dedicated to her garden project and willing to put in the time and effort.\n\n3. The garden is described as \"blooming healthily in no time at all.\" This suggests Kendall is taking good care of her garden for it to be thriving.\n\n4. Option (a) aligns with the information provided - it's logical that someone who put a lot of effort into creating a garden would regularly water and tend to it to maintain its health.\n\n5. Option (b) introduces new information about Kendall improving her violin skills. There is no prior mention of Kendall playing the violin or any connection between gardening and playing the violin.

This suggests he would aim to maintain a professional demeanor.\n\n2. The crowd's reaction to the bird is positive - they are laughing and cheering, not upset or concerned. This indicates the bird is a lighthearted distraction, not a major disruption.\n\n3. As a seasoned public speaker, the candidate would likely have the poise to acknowledge the amusing moment without letting it completely derail his speech. Making a brief, humorous comment would allow him to connect with the crowd.\n\n4. However, transitioning directly from the bird's appearance to discussing upcoming policy changes could come across as an abrupt and awkward change of topic. It may be more natural to simply acknowledge the levity of the moment before refocusing on his main points.\n\n5. Given the unexpected nature of the event, it's unlikely the candidate would have the perfect policy-related quip ready to seamlessly tie the bird's appearance to his political agenda.\n\nTherefore, option (a) seems more probable - the candidate would likely make a brief, good-natured acknowledgment of the bird before continuing with his prepared remarks. So (a) is the more likely scenario based on the information provided.",

Tom would probably share the story of how he got his scar because it was a significant event in his life, and people are often curious about the origins of visible scars.

Jodie was satisfied with the cleaners' work.\n\nNow, let's look at the two options:\n\n(a) Jodie might recommend the cleaners to others or rehire them in the future.\n- This option makes sense because Jodie was happy with the cleaners' performance. When people receive good service, they often recommend the service provider to others or use their services again in the future.\n\n(b) Jodie might recommend the cleaners to others or rehire them in the future to plan her next vacation.\n- This option doesn't make sense in the given context.
