This suggests a genuine appreciation for the classic car.\n\nWhile it's possible they might want to show off the car to friends, as suggested in option (b), there's no explicit indication of this motive in the given context.

However, more context would be needed to say definitively. The passage alone only directly states they fled to Oklahoma to start over, without mentioning if they sought help from others there.",

When experiencing intense anger or rage, it's common for autistic individuals to want to remove themselves from overwhelming or overstimulating environments. \n\nThe key detail that makes (b) more likely than (a) is the added reason of avoiding disruptions around others. Many high-functioning autistic people are self-aware enough to know their angry outbursts could be disturbing, confusing or upsetting to those around them. So isolating themselves is not just about calming down, but also considerately preventing a scene or negative impact on peers. The phrasing in (b) captures that additional social awareness and intent better than option (a).",
