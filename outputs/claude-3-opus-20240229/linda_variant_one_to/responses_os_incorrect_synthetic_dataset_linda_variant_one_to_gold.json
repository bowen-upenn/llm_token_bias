There is no specific information about Jordan wearing these pants to work. Therefore, the more general statement that he would continue wearing the new pair of pants is more probable, as it encompasses all situations, including work and other occasions.",

Given that Rick has now faced a negative health consequence due to not flossing, it seems probable that Marty would be even more motivated to get Rick to adopt better dental hygiene habits. Increasing the monetary reward is one likely approach she may take to provide Rick a stronger incentive to floss regularly and prevent additional dental problems like the gingivitis he experienced. The fact that he got gingivitis would likely make preventing further issues an important consideration for Marty in adjusting the reward system.",

Choosing to completely quit alcohol suggests Jon recognized he had a serious problem with drinking.\n\nOption (b) is more comprehensive and likely because it not only mentions Jon seeking support, but also specifies the purpose - to maintain his sobriety after deciding to quit. Attending meetings or counseling would provide ongoing support to help Jon stick with his decision and work through the underlying issues behind his excessive drinking. Option (a) mentions getting help, but doesn't connect it to his decision to get sober.",

It says he was \"relieved to have someone to play with,\" which suggests his immediate focus was on not being alone anymore and having an activity to engage in at recess. Making friends would be a probable positive outcome of joining the group to play, but not necessarily his driving reason in the moment.",

Exploring his skills further is a likely next step, but jumping to a professional career path is too much of an assumption based only on the details provided.",

While it's certainly possible they might post a photo on social media, there is no direct evidence to support this.
