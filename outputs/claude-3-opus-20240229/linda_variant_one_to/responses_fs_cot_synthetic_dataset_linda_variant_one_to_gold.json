Jordan was happy with the new pants because they were no longer too tight.\n\nNow, let's consider the two options:\n\n(a) Jordan would continue wearing the new pair of pants.\n- This option is broad and encompasses various situations where Jordan might wear the new pants, including at home, during leisure activities, and at work.\n\n(b) Jordan would continue wearing the new pair of pants to work.\n- This option is more specific and only refers to Jordan wearing the new pants in a work setting.\n\nGiven that Jordan is happy with the new pants and they fit him perfectly, it is more likely that he would continue wearing them in various situations, not just at work. Therefore, option (a) is more probable than option (b).\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is (a) Jordan would continue wearing the new pair of pants.",

The key difference is that option (b) adds the additional detail \"to restore its original beauty.\"\n\n2. The passage tells us that Brandon felt \"captive\" to the painting and was intently studying its \"various shades and hues.\" This suggests he had a strong appreciation for and connection to the painting's appearance and artistic qualities.\n\n3. Given Brandon's apparent fascination with the painting's aesthetic elements, if he were to repair it, his goal would very likely be to restore it to its original beautiful state that had him so captivated. Just repairing it without regard for its beauty seems less probable given his described attitude toward the painting.\n\n4. Option (b) is more specific than (a). In probability theory, a more specific outcome is generally less likely than a more general one that includes the specific case. However, the additional details in (b) seem to align with what we can reasonably infer about Brandon's motivations.\n\n5. Therefore, while option (b) may seem less likely in a pure probability sense, the context of the passage makes it the more probable scenario, since restoring the painting's beauty would likely be Brandon's intent if he attempted to repair it.\n\nSo in conclusion, the correct answer is (b) Brandon would attempt to repair the damaged painting to restore its original beauty.",

He brushes his teeth many times a day and has multiple toothbrushes.\n\n2. Brushing teeth immediately after eating candy shows James is proactive about preventing cavities and tooth decay.\n\n3. Option (a) states that James would likely replace his toothbrush regularly. This aligns with his concern for dental hygiene, as replacing toothbrushes regularly is a good practice to maintain their effectiveness.\n\n4. Option (b) also states that James would replace his toothbrush regularly, but adds the reason \"to ensure that it always remained effective at preventing cavities.\"\n\n5. While the reason in option (b) is likely true, it is an additional detail that is not necessary to answer the question. The question only asks which scenario is more likely, not why.\n\n6. According to the principle of Occam's razor, when faced with competing hypotheses that make the same predictions, one should select the solution with the fewest assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) James would likely replace his toothbrush regularly.

They have only seen each other about once every other year since then, suggesting they are not extremely close.\n\n3. The brother lives six hours away, which is a significant distance that could make frequent visits difficult.\n\n4. The brother is about to buy a house in the place where he lives, suggesting he is settled there and not likely to move closer to the protagonist.\n\n5. The protagonist is glad their brother is doing well but wishes they knew him better, implying a desire for a closer relationship.\n\n6. Given the physical distance and their history of infrequent visits, it's likely the protagonist would plan a visit to see their brother in general, rather than specifically to celebrate the purchase of the new house.\n\n7. While the new house could be a reason to visit, the protagonist's primary motivation seems to be the desire to know their brother better, rather than to celebrate this specific event.\n\nTherefore, option (a) \"The protagonist would likely plan a visit to see their brother\" appears more probable than option (b) \"The protagonist would likely plan a visit to see their brother to celebrate the purchase of his new house.\"",

The boy likely realizes there has been a misunderstanding, since a pillow is quite different from pudding and not something you would typically ask for after a dental procedure.\n\n4. To correct the misunderstanding, the boy has two main options:\n   (a) Gesture or write down what he meant, without specifying he wanted pudding again.\n   (b) Gesture or write down specifically that he wanted pudding, to reiterate his original request.\n\n5.

Since the question asks which is more likely, I would argue that option (a) is more probable.

The protagonist discovered the lack of oxygen while using a motorcycle in the tunnel.\n\nStep 1: Consider statement (a)\n- The protagonist is curious about why walking through the tunnel is prohibited.\n- It is likely that they would investigate the reason behind this prohibition.\n\nStep 2: Consider statement (b)\n- Statement (b) includes all the information from statement (a), but also adds a specific reason for the investigation (to find out about the oxygen levels).\n- However, the protagonist only discovered the lack of oxygen while using a motorcycle in the tunnel, which happened after they initially wondered why walking was prohibited.\n\nTherefore, statement (a) is more likely, as it does not assume the protagonist's prior knowledge of the oxygen levels being the reason for the walking prohibition. The protagonist's initial curiosity about the walking prohibition is more general, and the discovery of the oxygen levels came later.\n\nThe correct answer is (a) The protagonist would likely investigate why walking through the tunnel is prohibited.",

According to the principle of Occam's razor, when faced with competing hypotheses that make the same predictions, one should select the solution with the fewest assumptions.\n\n4. In this case, option (a) makes fewer assumptions and does not introduce any additional information that is not present in the original question.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is (a) Ray might start looking for a less stressful job or explore alternative ways to earn or save money for the computer.",

Option (b) adds additional information, saying that Joe's reason for protecting the sheep is \"to prevent them from getting hurt.\" While this is a logical reason for protecting the sheep, it is an extra detail not necessarily implied by the original story.\n\n3. In comparison, option (a) is a more concise and direct statement that follows from the story. It doesn't add any additional assumptions or details.\n\n4. When faced with two options like this, where one is a subset of the other, the more concise option is generally more probable. Adding extra details, even if they seem logical, reduces the probability of the statement as a whole being true.\n\nTherefore, the more likely answer is (a) Joe would protect his sheep from the wolves.",

The main reason is usually to keep the plants healthy and thriving.\n\n4. There is no information in the passage to suggest that Kendall's specific goal was to attract butterflies and hummingbirds. This additional detail makes option (b) less likely.\n\n5. Option (a) is a more general statement that aligns with the information given - that Kendall put effort into her garden and it was blooming healthily.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, option (a) \"Kendall would regularly water and tend to her garden\" is more likely than option (b).",

There is no indication in the prompt that Tom is attending a gathering with friends where he might be inclined to share this story to impress them.\n\nComparing the two options, (a) is more likely because it is a natural assumption that someone with a visible scar from an unusual incident would share the story when asked about it.
