The news mentions that Libya has been \"completely liberated\" according to the NTC vice chairman. This suggests a victorious and celebratory tone.\n\n2. In such situations, leaders often call for unity, patience and rebuilding after the conflict. Appeals for tolerance are common to bring people together.\n\n3. Option (a) fits this tone - a straightforward call for patience and tolerance by the NTC chairman in light of the liberation.\n\n4. Option (b), while conveying a similar message, seems unusually lengthy and detailed for a quote in this context. The specifics about \"international peace efforts\" and \"stability of the region\" seem less likely to be the focus here compared to a more domestically-oriented, succinct appeal.\n\n5. Concise, powerful statements tend to be more common and impactful in such triumphant moments, rather than detailed policy positions.\n\nTherefore, based on the tone and typical phrasing in such contexts, option (a) stating \"Mustafa Jalil, the NTC's chairman, calls on Libyans to be patient and tolerant\" seems more likely to be an actual quote or paraphrasing than the lengthier and more policy-heavy option (b).",

This shows they are a violent extremist group.\n\n3. The question is asking about their ties to al Qaeda.\n\nConsidering these points:\n\n(a) Simply states that the group has ties to al Qaeda. This is plausible given their violent extremist nature and opposition to Western influence, which aligns with al Qaeda's ideology.\n\n(b) Goes a step further by specifying the reason for the ties - to enhance capabilities and extend operations. While this is possible, the given information does not directly support this level of detail about the nature of the ties.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, option (a) is more likely. The group's ideology and actions suggest they could have ties to al Qaeda, but there isn't enough evidence to confidently say the ties are specifically for enhancing capabilities and extending operations as stated in option (b).",

Option (b) provides a plausible reason why an experienced moderator might admit to letting the discussion get sidetracked - so they could purposely steer things back to the intended topics.

This further suggests that the quality of the potato salad is not the main motivation for people donating.\n\n3. Option (a) simply states that donations have come from various countries. This is plausible given the viral nature of the Kickstarter. When something gains internet popularity, it often spreads internationally.\n\n4. Option (b) adds the suggestion that people from these countries are donating specifically so that Zack can learn to make better potato salad. This seems unlikely given points 1 and 2 - the quality of the potato salad doesn't seem to be the main driver of donations.\n\nTherefore, option (a) seems more likely.

Option (a) simply restates the given fact that the agency said bags were not properly screened. This aligns with the information provided.\n\n3. Option (b) adds an additional speculation that the reason the agency said bags were not properly screened was so that they could reduce staff workload.
