While it is true that jugs are a type of container and that many containers are made of glass, it does not necessarily follow that a significant number of jugs are made of glass.\n\nFor the conclusion to be logically sound, the argument would need to establish that a significant proportion of jugs are made of glass or that a significant proportion of glass containers are jugs.
