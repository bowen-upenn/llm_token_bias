The first premise states that \"butters belong to the category of dairy products.\" This is incorrect. Butter is made from the fat and protein in milk, but it is not considered a dairy product itself. Dairy products are foods made from milk that retain their calcium content, such as cheese, yogurt, and milk itself.\n\n2. The second premise, \"a selection of dairy products are particularly rich in calcium,\" is true. Many dairy products, such as milk, cheese, and yogurt, are indeed good sources of calcium.\n\n3. The conclusion, \"a subset of butters are also high in calcium,\" does not follow logically from the given premises. Since the first premise is false and butter is not a dairy product, the fact that some dairy products are high in calcium does not imply that some butters are high in calcium.\n\nIn fact, butter is not a significant source of calcium. While it does contain small amounts of calcium, it is primarily composed of fat and does not provide the same calcium content as genuine dairy products.\n\nTherefore, the argument presented is not logically sound due to the false first premise and the conclusion that does not follow from the premises.",
