Given his strong dedication and aspirations, it's unlikely he would simply give up after one person's negative reaction. \n\nInstead, the friend's harsh criticism would likely spur James to seek out additional perspectives beyond just that one friend's opinion. He would want to gather more feedback to determine if the book is truly terrible or if perhaps that friend just wasn't the target audience. The criticism could be a wake up call that relying on a single person's feedback is insufficient.\n\nSo while (a) is certainly a realistic possibility, (b) provides a more complete rationale for why James would revise and seek more opinions - because the experience made him realize the importance of getting diverse feedback to improve his writing and achieve his dream of being a great novelist. The friend's reaction alone isn't enough to conclude revision is needed, but it could be the catalyst for getting James to expand his feedback circle.",
