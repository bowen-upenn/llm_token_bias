Diarrhea and vomiting can lead to dehydration, as the body loses more fluids than it takes in. Dehydration is a common complication of gastroenteritis, especially in young children and older adults.\n\n3. Sunken eyes are a sign of moderate to severe dehydration. As the body becomes dehydrated, it tries to conserve water, leading to decreased skin turgor and sunken eyes.\n\n4. While sunken eyes can occur with dehydration, not all cases of dehydration will present with this symptom. Dehydration can range from mild to severe, and sunken eyes are more likely to appear in moderate to severe cases.\n\n5.

Fatigue is one of the most common symptoms of Hepatitis C, often being the first symptom to appear.\n\n4. Yellowing of the eyes (jaundice) is a more specific symptom that occurs when the liver is not functioning properly, causing a buildup of bilirubin in the body.\n\n5. While both fatigue and yellowing of the eyes are symptoms of Hepatitis C, fatigue is a more general and common symptom that is likely to be present in most cases.\n\n6. On the other hand, yellowing of the eyes is a more specific symptom that may not be present in all cases, especially in the early stages of the disease.\n\nBased on this analysis, option (b) \"He experiences fatigue\" is more likely than option (a) \"He experiences fatigue and yellowing of the eyes.\" While Robert may experience both symptoms, fatigue is more common and likely to occur, while yellowing of the eyes is a more specific symptom that may not be present in all cases.",

Malaise, which is a general feeling of discomfort, illness, or uneasiness, is a common symptom of many viral infections, including Dengue.\n\n3. Pain behind the eyes, also known as retro-orbital pain, is a distinctive feature of Dengue fever. It is often described as a severe pain that worsens with eye movement.\n\n4. The fact that Pat is 57 years old and transgender does not have any direct bearing on the likelihood of experiencing specific Dengue symptoms, as the virus affects individuals regardless of age or gender identity.\n\n5. Since both malaise and pain behind the eyes are common symptoms of Dengue, the likelihood of Pat experiencing both symptoms together is higher than experiencing just one of them.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the typical clinical presentation of Dengue, the most likely answer is:\n\n(a) Pat also experiences malaise and pain behind the eyes.",

Excessive hunger, medically termed polyphagia, can be a symptom of various conditions such as diabetes, hyperthyroidism, or certain psychiatric disorders. Acidity, or acid reflux, is a digestive disorder that causes stomach acid to flow back into the esophagus.\n\n4.

Impetigo is a highly contagious bacterial skin infection causing red sores on the face, primarily around a person's nose and mouth, and on hands and feet.\n\n2. The most common symptoms of impetigo are red sores that quickly rupture, ooze for a few days, and then form a yellowish-brown crust. The sores are often itchy but typically not painful.\n\n3. Skin rash is a characteristic symptom of impetigo, but high fever is not a typical symptom associated with this condition.\n\n4. In some cases, people with impetigo may experience a low-grade fever. However, a high fever would more likely indicate a different or additional infection.\n\n5. The presence of a skin rash alone, without mentioning fever, aligns more closely with the typical presentation of impetigo.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the typical symptoms of impetigo, option (b) \"She also experiences skin rash\" is more likely than option (a) \"She also experiences skin rash and high fever.\"",
