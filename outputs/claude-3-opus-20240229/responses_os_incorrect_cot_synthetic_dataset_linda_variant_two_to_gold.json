The key difference is that option (b) adds the additional detail that this strategy is meant \"to appease far-right base and losing moderate voters.\"\n\n3.

The principle of probability suggests that the option with fewer additional assumptions is more likely to be correct.\n\nTherefore, I would conclude that (a) is more likely to be the correct answer, as it sticks more closely to what is explicitly stated in the original text, without making the additional inference about losing moderate voters.",

A grand jury is a group of citizens that decides whether there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime and bring the case to trial. \n\n3. Grand jury proceedings are conducted in secret, without a judge or defense attorneys present. Only the prosecutor, grand jury members, and any witnesses testifying are allowed.\n\n4. For a federal grand jury, the general requirement is that at least 12 jurors must be present and at least 16 and no more than 23 members must be present to form a quorum to conduct business.\n\n5. Regarding the vote needed:\n(a) suggests that 9 out of 12 grand jurors must agree there is probable cause to press charges.\n(b) adds that this vote to press charges would bring the case to trial.\n\n6.
