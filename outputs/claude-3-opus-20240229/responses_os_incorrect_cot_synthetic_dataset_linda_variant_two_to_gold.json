        "init_model_answer": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n(1) The question is asking us to compare the probability of two statements about Demi's Lovelace role being filled by Chlo\u00eb Sevigny.\n\n(2) Statement (a) is a simple, straightforward claim: \"Demi's Lovelace role is rumoured to be filled by Chlo\u00eb Sevigny\". This is a single, self-contained piece of information.\n\n(3) Statement (b), on the other hand, makes the same claim as (a) but adds an additional claim: \"to co-star with Ryan Gosling in her next blockbuster film\". This additional information makes the statement more specific and complex.\n\n(4) In general, the more specific and detailed a claim is, the less likely it is to be true compared to a simpler claim. Each additional piece of information in a statement introduces another opportunity for the statement to be false.\n\n(5) Therefore, all else being equal, statement (a) is more likely to be true than statement (b), because (a) makes a single, simple claim while (b) makes that same claim and an additional claim.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (a) Demi's Lovelace role is rumoured to be filled by Chlo\u00eb Sevigny. This is more likely to be true than the more complex and specific statement (b).",

        "init_model_answer": "Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:\n\n1. The given information states that the grandmother, Joyce Garrard, faces a capital murder charge for forcing her 9-year-old granddaughter, Savannah Hardin, to run as punishment for eating chocolate, which led to the child's death.\n\n2. Option (a) suggests that the girl's stepmother will be indicted on a felony murder charge. This is plausible because the stepmother might have been involved in the incident or could be held responsible for not preventing the abuse.\n\n3. Option (b) also suggests that the girl's stepmother will be indicted on a felony murder charge, but with the additional reason of preventing her from influencing the grandmother's trial. This implies that the stepmother might have information or testimony that could impact the grandmother's case.\n\n4. Without additional information about the stepmother's involvement or potential influence on the grandmother's trial, option (b) makes an assumption that is not supported by the given facts.\n\n5. Occam's Razor principle suggests that when faced with competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the principle of Occam's Razor, option (a) is more likely: A grand jury indicts the girl's stepmother on a felony murder charge.",

        "question": "NEW: Powerful aftershock hits one month after deadly quake . \nJapan observes a minute of silence for disaster victims . \nThe quake has left more than 13,000 dead and 14,000 missing \nWhich is more likely?\n(a) \nThe crisis at a damaged nuclear plant is yet to be resolved \n(b) \nThe crisis at a damaged nuclear plant is yet to be resolved to and there are fears of radioactive leakage.",
        "target_answer": "(a) The crisis at a damaged nuclear plant is yet to be resolved",
        "retry": false,
        "use_multi_agents": false,
        "init_model_answer": "Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1. The additional details in option (b) about \"fears of radioactive leakage\" seem to fit with the context of a powerful aftershock hitting one month after a deadly earthquake in Japan that left over 27,000 people dead or missing. A damaged nuclear plant in such dire circumstances would understandably raise fears of potential radioactive leakage.\n\n2. However, option (b) is a subset of option (a). Option (a) just states that the crisis is unresolved, while (b) states that it is unresolved AND specifies fears about the nature of the unresolved crisis. \n\n3. Probability theory tells us that the probability of two events both occurring (A and B) is always less than or equal to the probability of either event alone (A or B). Therefore, the probability of \"The crisis is unresolved AND there are fears of leakage\" cannot be greater than the probability of just \"The crisis is unresolved\".\n\n4. Since option (b) cannot be more probable than option (a), the correct answer must be (a) - it is more likely that \"The crisis at a damaged nuclear plant is yet to be resolved.\"\n\nTherefore, (a) is the more likely scenario based on the information provided and the laws of probability.",

It provides additional relevant information without any redundancy.\n\n(b) \"No train passengers injured, official says to No passengers were injured in the train, official says, and the driver of the car was cited for reckless driving.\" This option starts with the same sentence as (a) but then unnecessarily repeats the information about no passengers being injured, just worded slightly differently. It then adds an extra detail about the driver being cited for reckless driving.\n\nGiven that (b) is unnecessarily repetitive while (a) conveys the key additional information concisely, the more likely and logical choice is (a) \"No train passengers injured, official says\".\n\nTherefore, (a) is more likely and the correct answer.",
