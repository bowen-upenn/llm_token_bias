Each spin is an independent event, and the probability of getting any specific sequence of five spins is (5/8)^3 * (3/8)^2, regardless of the order of silvers and navies.

Over a series of spins, we would expect roughly 5 A's for every 3 T's.\n\nSequence (c) has 5 A's and 3 T's, perfectly matching the expected 5:3 ratio based on the spinner's composition. The other sequences have too many T's compared to A's to be most probable.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that any specific sequence of 8 spins is actually equally likely. Picking the most representative sequence only maximizes the chances of winning if you assume the spinner will behave exactly according to probabilities over this small sample of spins.
