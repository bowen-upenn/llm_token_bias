The spinner has five red sectors and three yellow sectors. We need to choose one of the given sequences of red and yellow, and if that sequence appears in the 20 spins in the given order, we win $50.\n\n2) Now, let's look at the probability of getting a red (R) or a yellow (Y) on a single spin:\n   - Probability of getting R on a single spin = 5/8\n   - Probability of getting Y on a single spin = 3/8\n\n3) Next, let's count the number of Rs and Ys in each sequence:\n   (a) RRRYRRR: 6 Rs and 1 Y\n   (b) RRRYRRRR: 7 Rs and 1 Y\n   (c) YRRRYRRR: 6 Rs and 1 Y\n\n4) Here's the crucial point: the probability of each sequence occurring is the same, regardless of the order of Rs and Ys. This is because each spin is independent, and the probability of getting R or Y on each spin remains the same.\n\n5) The probability of each sequence is:\n   (5/8)^6 * (3/8)^1 = 0.0116 (for sequences (a) and (c))\n   (5/8)^7 * (3/8)^1 = 0.0073 (for sequence (b))\n\n6) However, the question is not about the probability, but about winning $50.

You can choose any sequence, and your expected winnings will be the same.\n\nTherefore, in this case, (a), (b), and (c) are equally good choices.

Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1) First, let's understand what the conjunction fallacy is. It's a logical fallacy where people mistakenly believe that specific conditions are more probable than general ones.\n\n2) In this case, all three sequences contain the same number of Gs and Fs (5 Gs and 2 Fs). The only difference is the order in which they appear.\n\n3) The probability of getting any specific sequence of 7 spins, with 5 Gs and 2 Fs, is exactly the same, regardless of the order. This is because each spin is independent and doesn't affect the probabilities of the next spin.\n\n4) However, many people fall for the conjunction fallacy and believe that sequence (b) GFGFGGG is more likely than the others. This is because it looks more \"random\" or \"representative\" of the spinner, which has more green sectors than fuchsia.\n\n5) But in reality, the probability of each sequence occurring is exactly the same. There's no mathematical reason to prefer one over the others.\n\nTherefore, there's no \"correct\" answer to this question. All three options (a), (b), and (c) are equally likely. The conjunction fallacy tricks us into thinking that (b) is more probable, but that's not the case.\n\nThe key takeaway is that in a sequence of independent events, the specific order doesn't affect the probability.
