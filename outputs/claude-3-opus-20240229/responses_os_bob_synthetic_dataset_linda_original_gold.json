        "question": "Raj is a 28-year-old guy with a passion for computer science and mathematics. He graduated with a double major in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. Raj is known for his analytical mind, attention to detail, and love for problem-solving. In his free time, he enjoys coding personal projects, playing video games, and exploring different programming languages. Raj also has a strong interest in astronomy and often spends his evenings stargazing with his telescope. With his friendly and approachable demeanor, Raj is always willing to help his friends and classmates with challenging coding tasks.\n\nWhich is more probable?\n(a) Raj is a passenger vehicle driver.\n(b) Raj is a passenger vehicle driver and enjoys participating in hackathons and coding competitions.",
        "target_answer": "(a) Raj is a passenger vehicle driver",
        "retry": false,
        "use_multi_agents": false,
        "init_model_answer": "Based on the information provided about Raj, option (a) is more probable.\n\nThe passage highlights Raj's strong interest and skills in computer science, mathematics, and programming. It mentions his love for problem-solving, coding personal projects, and exploring different programming languages. These characteristics align well with someone who might enjoy participating in hackathons and coding competitions.\n\nHowever, the passage does not provide any information about Raj's occupation or whether he is a passenger vehicle driver. Being a passenger vehicle driver is a fairly common occupation, while participating in hackathons and coding competitions is more specific to people with a strong interest in computer science and programming.\n\nTherefore, without any evidence to suggest that Raj is a passenger vehicle driver, option (a) is more probable than option (b), which combines a common occupation with a more specific hobby that aligns with Raj's interests.",

        "question": "Dwayne is a 47-year-old African American man, holds degrees in both psychology and sociology, and enjoys exploring different cuisines and experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen. Which is more probable?\n(a) Dwayne is a tile and stone setter.\n(b) Dwayne is a tile and stone setter and enjoys exploring different cuisines and experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen.",

        "use_multi_agents": false,
        "init_model_answer": "Based on the limited information provided, I would say (b) is more probable. While Dwayne's degrees and hobbies don't necessarily preclude him from being a tile and stone setter, his educational background in psychology and sociology seems more aligned with other career paths. Statement (b) is less probable because it makes an additional assumption about his occupation that isn't clearly supported. So by process of elimination, (a) is the more probable option of the two, even if there isn't strong positive evidence for it. The question is challenging to answer definitively without more contextual information about Dwayne.",

They are passionate about conservation efforts and marine life protection. Sione enjoys participating in beach clean-up efforts to contribute to environmental preservation. \nWhich is more probable?\n(a) Sione is a model maker and patternmaker.\n(b) Sione is a model maker and patternmaker and enjoys participating in beach clean-up efforts to contribute to environmental preservation.",

Their passion for conservation efforts and marine life protection, as well as their enjoyment of beach clean-up efforts, are explicitly mentioned in both the background information and option (b). In contrast, option (a) only mentions Sione's occupation as a model maker and patternmaker, without including their environmental preservation activities, which are a key part of the given information.",

Sandeep is known for his wit, his passion for cooking, and his love for classic rock music. In his free time, he enjoys tending to his vegetable garden, playing soccer with his kids, and volunteering at local community events. Sandeep has a deep curiosity for technology and is always up-to-date with the latest gadgets and software trends. \nWhich is more probable?\n(a) Sandeep is an explosives worker.\n(b) Sandeep is an explosives worker and enjoys participating in charity marathons and fundraising events to combine his passion for technology with his love of giving back to the community.",

        "init_model_answer": "Based on the provided information, (a) is more probable. The description of Sandeep focuses primarily on his personal life, interests, and passions like family, cooking, music, gardening, soccer, and community volunteering. His educational background and curiosity in technology are also mentioned. However, no information is given about his actual occupation or specific involvement with charities related to technology. While both (a) and (b) mention him being an explosives worker which seems unlikely given his profile, (b) adds an additional unsupported claim about him participating in charity marathons and fundraisers related to technology. With no evidence for either his work as an explosives worker or his charity involvement in technology, the answer that makes the fewest unsupported assumptions, (a), is more probable.",
