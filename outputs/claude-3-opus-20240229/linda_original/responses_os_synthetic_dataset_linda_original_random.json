This is because the probability of two events both being true (Alex being a carpenter AND enjoying model airplanes) is always less than or equal to the probability of either event alone.\n\nGiven Alex's described background in environmental science, public policy, climate advocacy, and interests in weaving, indigenous art and outdoor exploration, there is no particular reason to expect them to be a carpenter. Adding the model airplane hobby makes the combined probability even lower.\n\nThis illustrates the conjunction fallacy, where people tend to think more specific scenarios are more probable than general ones, even though probability theory shows the opposite must be true.",
