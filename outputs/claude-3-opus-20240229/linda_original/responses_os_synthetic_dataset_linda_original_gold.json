It's tempting to pick (b) because the additional details seem to fit well with the description of Shayla.

There are undoubtedly fewer people who are both audiologists and in Native American drum circles compared to those only in drum circles.\n\nThis question illustrates the conjunction fallacy in action - our tendency to misjudge more specific scenarios as being more probable than general ones. It's an important bias to be aware of when estimating probabilities. The correct approach is to consider the relative sizes of the categories rather than how well the specifics seem to match.",

Even if those traits and activities are an important part of who Jordan is, they don't necessarily make it more likely that Jordan has one job versus another.\n\nOn a purely statistical level, there are likely far more dredge operators in total than there are dredge operators who also organize LGBTQ+ workshops.

Jordan sounds like a multi-faceted individual with many important roles and interests beyond their day job. No matter what Jordan's profession is, their identity, heritage and community involvement are equally valid and integral parts of who they are.
