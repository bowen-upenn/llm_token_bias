Jordan is also an avid reader and enjoys exploring speculative fiction, finding parallels and lessons in its narratives that apply to their activism. Their personal blog, where they muse about social dynamics and personal experiences, has a dedicated following.\n\nWhich is more probable?\n(a) Jordan is a driver/sales worker.\n(b) Jordan is a driver/sales worker and enjoys birdwatching in a local park.",

Their interests and education suggest a path more aligned with social issues and activism.\n\n(b) Jordan is a driver/sales worker and enjoys birdwatching in a local park.\n- This option includes the same unlikely career choice for Jordan, with the additional detail of enjoying birdwatching.\n- Birdwatching is a hobby that anyone could enjoy, regardless of their career or background. However, it doesn't particularly align with or contradict what we know about Jordan.\n\nThe key point is that option (b) is a more specific version of option (a). It contains all the information in (a), plus an additional detail.\n\nIn probability, a more specific outcome is always less likely or, at most, equally likely as a more general one that encompasses it. This is because for (b) to be true, both the driver/sales worker aspect AND the birdwatching detail need to be true. Whereas for (a), only the driver/sales worker part needs to be true.\n\nTherefore, even though both options seem unlikely given Jordan's background, (a) is still more probable than (b), as it has fewer specific requirements.\n\nSo, the answer is (a) Jordan is a driver/sales worker.",

Nuclear power, while low-carbon, is often not considered a \"green\" energy source by many environmentalists.\n\n(b) Riley is a nuclear power reactor operator and tries birdwatching at a local park.\n- This option includes the unlikely scenario of Riley being a nuclear power reactor operator, and adds the additional condition of Riley trying birdwatching.\n- While the detail about birdwatching aligns with Riley's interest in nature and outdoors activities, it doesn't make the unlikely job of nuclear power reactor operator any more probable.\n\nIn probability theory, for two events A and B, the probability of both events occurring together (A and B) is always less than or equal to the probability of either event occurring alone. Mathematically, P(A and B) \u2264 P(A) and P(A and B) \u2264 P(B).\n\nTherefore, even without knowing the exact probabilities, we can logically deduce that the probability of Riley being a nuclear power reactor operator and trying birdwatching (option b) is always less than or equal to the probability of Riley being a nuclear power reactor operator (option a).\n\nSo, the more probable scenario is (a) Riley is a nuclear power reactor operator.",

Executives often possess strong communication and leadership skills, which Morgan seems to demonstrate through their advocacy work and writing. So the probability of (a) being true is reasonably high.\n\n(b) This option includes all the information from (a), but adds an additional detail about Morgan enjoying knitting colorful scarves. While this is certainly possible, the passage does not provide any information to support this specific hobby. Introducing this additional element makes the probability of (b) being true lower than the probability of (a).\n\nIn general, the more specific conditions you add to a scenario, the lower the probability becomes, unless you have supporting evidence for those conditions.\n\nTherefore, (a) is more probable than (b). The correct answer is (a) Morgan is a top executive.",

Passionate about technology and its potential to drive social change\n6. Mentors young women in STEM fields\n7. Enjoys exploring local art galleries\n8. Avid reader of biographies\n9. Enjoys jogging\n\nStep 1: Analyze option (a)\nBased on Angela's educational background in Computer Science and Data Analytics, as well as her passion for technology and mentoring young women in STEM, it is unlikely that she would be working as a textile winding, twisting, and drawing out machine setter, operator, and tender. Her skill set and interests align more with technology-related fields.\n\nStep 2: Analyze option (b)\nOption (b) includes the same information as option (a) but with an additional detail about building model airplanes. The given information about Angela does not mention any interest or experience in model airplanes or related hobbies.\n\nStep 3: Compare the probabilities\n- Option (a) is unlikely given Angela's background and interests.\n- Option (b) is even less likely because it includes the same unlikely scenario as option (a) with an additional detail that is not supported by the given information.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information and the analysis above, the more probable scenario is:\n\n(a) Angela is a textile winding, twisting, and drawing out machine setter, operator, and tender.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that even option (a) is unlikely given Angela's background and interests. The most probable scenario would be Angela working in a technology-related field, but this option was not provided in the question.",

Traditional weaving and indigenous art are mentioned as interests, but not carpentry.\n\n(b) Alex is a carpenter and enjoys building model airplanes.\n\nThis option includes the assumption from (a) that Alex is a carpenter, and adds an additional detail about enjoying building model airplanes. There's no information given about Alex's interest in model airplanes.\n\nWhen comparing the two options, (a) is more probable than (b).

Since each additional assumption reduces probability, (a) is more likely.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that neither (a) nor (b) are supported by the given information.
