Ignore the background information: Although the description of Kai Jordan might suggest a higher likelihood of participating in digital activism campaigns, this information should not influence the probabilistic reasoning. The background information is designed to mislead and trigger the representativeness heuristic.\n\n5.

According to the basic probability rule, the probability of a conjunction, P(A and B), is always less than or equal to the probabilities of its constituents, P(A) or P(B).\n\n4. Therefore, the probability of Ella being a waitress (option a) is always greater than or equal to the probability of Ella being a waitress and often attending economic forums to enhance her knowledge and network within her field (option b).\n\n5. The additional information provided about Ella's background, interests, and career is not relevant when answering this question from a purely probabilistic perspective.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is (a) Ella is a waitress, as it is more probable than the conjunction presented in option (b).",

We are given two options to compare: \n   (a) River is a bioengineer and biomedical engineer.\n   (b) River is a bioengineer and biomedical engineer and often participates in ecological restoration projects to revive native plant species and their natural habitats.\n\n2. Option (a) consists of a single conjunction: River being both a bioengineer and a biomedical engineer. Let's call this event A.\n\n3. Option (b) includes the conjunction in (a), but adds an additional condition - that River often participates in ecological restoration projects. Let's call this additional event B.\n\n4. So option (b) is essentially the conjunction of events A and B.\n\n5. From the basic rules of probability, we know that the probability of a conjunction P(A and B) is always less than or equal to the probability of its individual events P(A) or P(B).\n\n6. Therefore, the probability of option (b), P(A and B), must be less than or equal to the probability of option (a), P(A).\n\n7. So without needing to consider any of the background information about River, we can conclude that option (a) is more probable than option (b).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) River is a bioengineer and biomedical engineer, as it is statistically more probable than option (b) which includes an additional conjunctive condition.",
