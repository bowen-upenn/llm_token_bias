These qualities could certainly lend themselves to an executive-level role, perhaps at an environmental nonprofit or sustainability-focused company.\n\nHowever, no information is given about Morgan's actual occupation or whether they enjoy knitting as a hobby. The added detail about knitting colorful scarves in option (b) is unsupported by the provided background. With no evidence for that specific hobby, the compound probability of Morgan being both an executive and an avid knitter would be lower than the probability of them being an executive alone.\n\nSo in comparing the two options solely based on the biographical details provided, I conclude that (a) Morgan being a top executive is more probable than (b) Morgan being a top executive who enjoys knitting colorful scarves. The knitting detail is extraneous and lowers the probability of option (b) relative to (a).",
