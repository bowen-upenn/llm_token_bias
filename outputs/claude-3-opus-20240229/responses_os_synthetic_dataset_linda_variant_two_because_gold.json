It's extraneous unsupported information.\n\nSo while the passage doesn't directly state that polls show waning support, the context clues around uncertain Senate passage and it being a non-partisan issue suggest that public support is likely diminished, without the need for the additional speculation about reasons why that is provided in (b).\n\nTherefore, based on evaluating the two options against the original information provided, I conclude that (a) is more likely to be an accurate statement.",

This suggests a pattern of improper and possibly illegal conduct by the police department.\n\nStatement (a) logically follows, indicating the high number of arrests is straining the small department's resources. There's no clear mention of people finding it difficult to pay release fees as the primary reason for the strain.\n\nWhile (b) introduces the idea that difficulty paying fees is straining the department, this extra detail is not directly supported by the original text.
