While Maria could potentially experience both breathlessness and frequent headaches, adding the additional specific condition of headaches makes the joint probability lower than the probability of breathlessness alone.\n\nMathematically, if we denote P(B) as the probability of breathlessness and P(H) as the probability of frequent headaches, then P(B and H) = P(B) * P(H|B) where P(H|B) is the conditional probability of headaches given breathlessness. Since P(H|B) is a probability, it must be less than or equal to 1. Therefore, P(B and H) must be less than or equal to P(B).",

A study by Langguth et al. (2017) found that around 30-50% of migraine patients also experience tinnitus.\n\nGiven this information, both options are plausible.
