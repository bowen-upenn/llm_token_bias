        "use_multi_agents": false,
        "init_model_answer": "Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:\n\n1. The Rolling Stones are an extremely popular and successful band with a large, dedicated global fanbase. They have had numerous hit albums and sold-out tours over their long career.\n\n2. While the music industry has changed a lot and it's harder for older artists to chart highly with new albums these days, The Rolling Stones' popularity and legacy means a new album would likely generate a lot of interest and sales. It would be quite unlikely for a new Rolling Stones album to not chart at all in any country.\n\n3. Even if the album hypothetically didn't chart well, a world tour by The Rolling Stones would still be a huge event. Their fanbase would likely jump at the chance to see them perform live, especially if it was billed as a tour supporting a new album. Major venues around the world would almost certainly sell out.\n\n4. The scenario in (b), where the album charts poorly but the tour sells out, is a more specific case of the scenario in (a) where the album simply charts poorly. Probability theory tells us that the probability of a more specific event cannot be greater than the probability of a more general event that completely contains it.\n\n5. Therefore, even though both scenarios seem unlikely, (a) must be more probable than (b), because (b) cannot have a greater likelihood than (a).\n\nSo in conclusion, the answer is (a) The album won't chart in any country. This is more likely than the compound scenario of the album not charting but the tour still selling out.",

Most of his movies are well-received by critics and audiences alike. This makes option (a) less likely from the start.\n\n2) Option (b) is a more specific scenario than option (a). It describes the same situation as (a) - the movie receiving backlash and failing commercially - but with the additional detail of DiCaprio winning an award for his performance.\n\n3) In probability theory, a general rule is that the probability of the intersection of two events (A and B occurring together) is always less than or equal to the probability of either event alone. In other words, P(A and B) \u2264 P(A) and P(A and B) \u2264 P(B).\n\n4) Applying this to our scenario, the probability of the movie failing critically and commercially AND DiCaprio winning an award (option b) must be less than or equal to the probability of just the movie failing (option a).\n\n5) Therefore, option (a) is more likely than option (b).\n\nSo, after thinking it through, I would say (a) The movie receives critical backlash and fails at the box office is more likely.",

Charles De Gaulle was a prominent French statesman and army officer who led the Free French Forces against Nazi Germany in World War II. He later founded the Fifth Republic in 1958 and served as its first president from 1959 to 1969. This historical background suggests he had a deep understanding of the political issues of his time.\n\n2. However, the political landscape and issues have evolved significantly since De Gaulle's era. New challenges such as globalization, climate change, the rise of social media, and shifting geopolitical dynamics have emerged, which he might find unfamiliar.\n\n3. Despite this, De Gaulle's reputation as a strong leader who guided France through difficult times might still resonate with some segments of the French population. His historical stature could potentially attract a following.\n\n4. Nevertheless, to gain significant political support in the modern era, a deep understanding of current issues and the ability to propose relevant solutions is crucial. Reputation alone might not suffice to gain a large following.\n\n5. Considering these factors, while De Gaulle's historical reputation might grant him some initial attention, his lack of understanding of modern political issues would likely limit his ability to gain a significant following.\n\nTherefore, option (a) seems more likely: If Charles De Gaulle were to return to French politics today, he would not understand modern political issues, and this lack of understanding would hinder his ability to gain a substantial following, despite his historical reputation.",

While Bieber is a popular artist, not all of his albums have received Grammy nominations in the past. So it's certainly possible, perhaps even likely, that a new album might not get nominated.\n\n2) Now, let's consider the likelihood of a new Justin Bieber album having at least one Billboard No. 1 single. Bieber has had numerous No. 1 singles over his career, so it's very plausible that a new album would contain at least one song that tops the charts.\n\n3) The key here is to recognize that option (b) is a subset of option (a).

Many vaccine candidates don't make it past early safety and efficacy testing. So right off the bat, option (a) seems quite likely.\n\n2. However, the additional information given about Dr. David Ho is relevant. Dr. Ho is a renowned scientist who has made significant contributions to HIV/AIDS research and treatment. This track record suggests he and his team would be highly capable in developing an effective vaccine.\n\n3. Option (b) is more specific than option (a). It's essentially option (a) with an additional positive outcome tacked on - the vaccine eventually succeeding and becoming widely used after further development. \n\n4. In most cases, a more specific outcome is less likely than a more general one. Many things would need to go right for the initial vaccine failure to be overcome and for it to eventually become the leading pandemic vaccine.\n\n5. Without the specifics about Dr. Ho's expertise, option (a) would be the clear choice as the more likely outcome. But his involvement does increase the plausibility of the vaccine ultimately succeeding even if it encounters initial setbacks.\n\n6. That said, overcoming a failed initial trial is still a steep uphill battle for any vaccine. Many initially promising candidates never make it, even with top scientists behind them.\n\nSo in weighing these considerations, I believe (a) is still more likely than (b). Dr. Ho's involvement makes the outcome in (b) more plausible than it would be otherwise, but it's still a less likely result than the vaccine simply failing initial trials and not moving forward, as many vaccine candidates do.\n\nTherefore, I select (a) as the more likely outcome: The vaccine fails in initial trials.",

Opening concerts of major tours by big-name acts are usually highly-anticipated events and tend to sell out quickly, especially if it's been a while since the band last toured.

It's plausible that even if Musk flew with another company (which seems unlikely), he might still use SpaceX technology for habitat construction, leveraging his company's expertise in that area.\n\n5. But overall, the combination of flying with another company AND using SpaceX tech for the habitat seems less likely than simply flying with another company, given his strong ties to SpaceX.\n\nTherefore, considering the information given, I would say that option (a) is more likely: If Elon Musk decided to live on Mars by 2040, he would be more likely to fly with another aerospace company than to fly with another aerospace company AND use SpaceX technology to build a habitat.",

Pope Francis' emphasis on mercy and forgiveness:\n   - Throughout his papacy, Pope Francis has consistently emphasized the importance of mercy, forgiveness, and compassion as central to the Christian message.\n   - He has often spoken about the need to show mercy to those on the margins of society, including prisoners and those who have committed crimes.\n\n3.

Many critically panned albums have still been hugely commercially successful.\n\n4) On the other hand, for an album to be both critically panned and top the charts, it would need to have the relatively rare combination of being very popular but also disliked by critics.\n\n5) Probabilistically, the intersection of two events (poor reviews AND topping the charts) is always less likely or at most equally likely compared to either event alone (poor reviews). \n\nTherefore, when considering the two options:\n\n(a) The album receives critically poor reviews.\n(b) The album receives critically poor reviews but tops the Billboard charts.\n\nOption (a) is more likely. An album getting poor reviews is more probable than an album getting poor reviews and also being a chart-topper. So I would choose (a) as the answer.",

While it's certainly possible for an album to not chart well initially but gain popularity over time and eventually hit a milestone like going platinum, this is a less probable scenario for an artist as high-profile as Jay-Z.\n\n5. Jay-Z's albums are typically heavily promoted and highly visible, making a slow-burn to success less likely compared to a strong debut.\n\nTherefore, option (a) \"The album does not chart on its first week\" is more likely than option (b) \"The album does not chart on its first week but eventually goes platinum.\" \n\nThe additional condition in (b) of going platinum despite not charting is an extra constraint that makes it less probable than (a) on its own.",

Becoming a celebrated artist in the contemporary art scene typically requires years of dedicated practice, training, and building up a strong body of innovative work and reputation in the art world. The odds of any new painter, even with natural talent, quickly becoming a celebrated artist are quite low.\n\n2. However, as a former U.S. President, anything George W. Bush does will automatically draw significant public attention and interest due to the novelty and notoriety of his former office. If he were to start painting, his works would likely attract outsized interest, publicity and even potential sales compared to an unknown artist, regardless of the artistic merits.\n\n3. The contemporary art world does appreciate innovation and artistic vision. But it is also drawn to novelty, celebrity, and buzz. Paintings by a former world leader would have a compelling hook beyond just their pure artistic value.\n\nSo in weighing the two options, while both are unlikely, I believe (b) is more probable than (a). The chances of George W. Bush becoming a top celebrated artist purely on the artistic merits of his landscape paintings are extremely slim. But the chances of his paintings gaining major attention, appreciation and even celebration more so for their novelty coming from a former president are somewhat higher, even if the artistic innovation is lacking.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that (b) is the more likely scenario, even though both are improbable. The publicity hook of his past presidency makes the celebrated artist scenario more plausible, with the recognition driven more by novelty than pure artistic prowess.",

This seems to contradict the initial statement about Truman being the most influential post-war president.

She does not have a background as a professional actress in other types of roles.\n\n2) Winning an Academy Award for Best Actress is extremely difficult, even for the most talented and experienced professional actresses. Many great actresses have never won this award in their entire careers.\n\n3) If Judge Judy were to win an Academy Award, it seems more plausible that it would be for a role that aligns with her existing persona and experience - i.e. playing a judge.\n\n4) The probability of her winning Best Actress for any role is very low, given her lack of acting experience. But if she were to win, the probability seems higher that it would be for playing a judge compared to playing a completely different kind of character.\n\n5) Therefore, even though both scenarios are unlikely, option (b) is more probable - that if Judge Judy were to win an Academy Award for Best Actress, it would be more likely for a role where she plays a judge, compared to a different kind of role.\n\nSo in conclusion, I would say (b) is the more likely scenario, even though both have a low probability of occurring. The additional specificity of her playing a judge in option (b) makes it more probable than her winning for playing a different type of character.",

A book about his life would generate significant interest and likely strong initial sales, making it quite plausible that it would become a bestseller in the first week of release.\n\n2) While it's certainly possible the book could contain some controversial opinions, assuming this with no other information is unwarranted speculation. There's no particular reason to expect controversy.\n\n3) More importantly, even if the book did contain controversial content, this would not necessarily make it more likely to be a bestseller. Controversy can sometimes increase sales but can also deter some buyers. The Pope's stature alone would be the main driver of high sales.\n\n4) Probability theory tells us that the probability of two events both occurring (book is a bestseller AND has controversial content) is always less than or equal to the probability of either event occurring alone. So even if controversial content made bestseller status equally likely, (a) would still be more probable than (b).\n\nTherefore, without any additional information to suggest otherwise, (a) is the more likely scenario based on the Pope's prominence and the book's assumed broad appeal.",

Initial criticism is not uncommon.\n\n(3) That said, even if Rowling's new book receives some harsh initial criticism, her reputation and the loyalty of her fans make it likely that the book will still sell very well.

Becoming a bestseller usually requires not just a famous author, but strong word-of-mouth and sales momentum.\n\n(5) Therefore, while both (a) and (b) are plausible, (a) is more likely. Receiving some harsh criticism is more probable than becoming a bestseller in under a year, even for a highly popular author.\n\nIn conclusion, (a) is the more likely scenario: That J.K.

        "init_model_answer": "Okay, let's think this through step by step:\n\n1. George C. Marshall was a brilliant military leader and diplomat who served as U.S. Secretary of State from 1947 to 1949. He was the architect of the Marshall Plan, which helped rebuild Western Europe after World War II.\n\n2. If Marshall were to come back to modern times, he would face a significantly different geopolitical landscape compared to the post-WWII era. The Cold War is over, new global powers have emerged, and the nature of international conflicts has changed.\n\n3. Given his vast experience and intellectual prowess, it's likely that Marshall would initially struggle to grasp the complexities of contemporary geopolitics. He would need time to study and adapt to the new context.\n\n4. However, Marshall was known for his exceptional ability to analyze complex situations, think strategically, and find innovative solutions. These qualities would likely help him navigate the modern geopolitical landscape.\n\n5. While brokering a groundbreaking international agreement would be a significant challenge, it's not impossible for someone with Marshall's skills and reputation. He was able to achieve this in the past with the Marshall Plan.\n\n6. That said, the likelihood of Marshall single-handedly brokering a major agreement in a new era is lower than the likelihood of him struggling to understand contemporary geopolitics.\n\nConsidering these points, I believe that option (a) \"He struggles to understand contemporary geopolitics\" is more likely than option (b) \"He struggles to understand contemporary geopolitics but eventually brokers a groundbreaking international agreement.\"",

        "question": "Suppose Kamala Harris is planning to run in the 2024 presidential election. Which is more likely:\n(a) Kamala Harris will lose in the primary elections.\n(b) Kamala Harris will lose in the primary elections but be chosen as the vice-presidential candidate again.",

        "use_multi_agents": false,
        "init_model_answer": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n(1) Kamala Harris is the current vice president. Incumbent vice presidents have historically had a strong chance of winning their party's presidential nomination if they choose to run. However, Harris' approval ratings as VP have been relatively low.\n\n(2) If Harris were to lose in the Democratic primary elections, it would be unusual for her to then be chosen again as the vice-presidential running mate. Typically, the presidential nominee chooses a new running mate.\n\n(3) Harris' chances of winning the Democratic nomination likely depend on factors such as the strength of other primary candidates, the state of the economy and world affairs in 2024, and her ability to increase her popularity and support base in the coming years. But an incumbent VP would generally be considered one of the frontrunners.\n\n(4) The probability of Harris losing the primaries and then being chosen as VP again anyway seems quite low, as it would be an unusual occurrence, especially given no clear reason why the eventual nominee would choose her again after she lost.\n\nTherefore, I believe the best answer is (a) Kamala Harris will lose in the primary elections. While this is certainly not guaranteed, it appears more probable than the dual case of her losing the nomination but still being chosen as vice-presidential nominee again.",

        "question": "Suppose Nikita Khrushchev is giving a speech at the United Nations. Which is more likely:\n(a) He will receive a standing ovation from all present.\n(b) He will receive a standing ovation from all present but then dramatically remove his shoe and bang it on the table.",
        "target_answer": "(a) He will receive a standing ovation from all present",
        "retry": false,
        "use_multi_agents": false,
        "init_model_answer": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n(1) Nikita Khrushchev was the leader of the Soviet Union during the Cold War, a period of great tension between the Soviet Union and the United States. Given this context, it's unlikely that he would receive a standing ovation from all present at a UN speech, as many Western representatives would likely have reservations about his policies and rhetoric.\n\n(2) The shoe-banging incident did actually occur during a United Nations General Assembly meeting in 1960. However, this was a singular, famous event, not something that happened regularly.\n\n(3) If we assume that Khrushchev received a standing ovation (which is already unlikely), the probability that he would then proceed to bang his shoe on the table is even lower. This is because even if he did receive an ovation, it's a leap to assume he would then engage in such a dramatic and unconventional gesture.\n\n(4) In general, the probability of two independent events both occurring (in this case, receiving a standing ovation and banging his shoe) is always lower than the probability of just one of those events occurring.\n\nTherefore, (a) is more likely than (b). While both scenarios are improbable, it's even less likely that Khrushchev would both receive a unanimous standing ovation and bang his shoe than that he would just receive the ovation.",

He was a key figure in the Iranian Revolution and the establishment of an Islamic republic in Iran.\n\n2. Khomeini's political and religious views were often at odds with Western political philosophy and values. He was a staunch critic of the United States and its policies in the Middle East.\n\n3. Given Khomeini's political and religious views, it is unlikely that his book on political philosophy would align with mainstream American political thought.\n\n4. However, the book might gain attention in the United States due to Khomeini's prominent role in recent history and the ongoing tensions between Iran and the United States. This attention could potentially lead to high sales, making it a bestseller.\n\n5. If the book does become a bestseller in the USA, it is highly likely that Western scholars would heavily criticize it due to the stark differences between Khomeini's views and Western political philosophy.\n\nTherefore, option (b) is more likely: The book becomes a bestseller in the USA but is heavily criticized by Western scholars. The added condition of heavy criticism from Western scholars makes option (b) more probable than option (a), which only states that the book becomes a bestseller in the USA.",

        "init_model_answer": "Let's break this down step-by-step:\n\n(1) John J. Sirica was a U.S. District Court judge who became famous for presiding over the Watergate trials in the 1970s. In that role, he was known for his tough stance and integrity in upholding the law, even under immense political pressure.\n\n(2) The question posits a hypothetical future scenario where Sirica becomes involved in another major political trial. \n\n(3) Option (a) suggests that in this scenario, Sirica would compromise his legal principles. Based on his history, this seems unlikely - he was known for his unwavering commitment to the law.\n\n(4) Option (b) is a subset of option (a). It suggests that even if Sirica were to compromise his principles at some point, he would ultimately still uphold the integrity of the legal process in the end.\n\n(5) However, option (b) cannot be more likely than option (a). Any scenario where (b) occurs is by definition also a scenario where (a) occurs, but not vice versa. The probability of (a) will always be greater than or equal to the probability of (b).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) He compromises his legal principles. The question is an example of the conjunction fallacy, where a more specific scenario is incorrectly judged to be more probable than a more general one that includes it.",
