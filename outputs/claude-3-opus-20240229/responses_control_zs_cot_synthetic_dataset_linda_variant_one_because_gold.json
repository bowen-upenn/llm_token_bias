Option (b) is a conjunction of two events: Tom arranging pickup AND being eager to furnish his new apartment. Option (a) is a single event: Tom arranging pickup.\n\n3. From probability theory, we know that the probability of a conjunction (A and B) is always less than or equal to the probability of its individual constituents (A or B).\n\n4. Therefore, without needing to consider the specific narrative details, we can conclude that the probability of option (a) must be greater than or equal to the probability of option (b).\n\n5. The additional information in option (b) about Tom's eagerness and new apartment, while potentially plausible, is extraneous to the probability judgment. It doesn't change the fundamental probability rule.\n\nSo, by focusing on the abstract probabilistic structure and ignoring the tempting narrative details, the correct answer is (a) Tom would arrange to pick up the furniture he purchased on Craigslist. This single event is necessarily more probable than the conjunction presented in option (b).",
