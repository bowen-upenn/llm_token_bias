Option (a) states a single event: Chlo\u00eb Sevigny is rumored to fill Demi's role in Lovelace.\n\n2. Option (b) is a conjunction of two events: \n   (i) Chlo\u00eb Sevigny is rumored to fill Demi's role in Lovelace, AND \n   (ii) Chlo\u00eb Sevigny is rumored to co-star with Ryan Gosling in her next blockbuster film.\n\n3. The probability of a single event (a) is always greater than or equal to the probability of that event occurring in conjunction with another event (b).\n\n4. This is because for (b) to be true, both the events (i) and (ii) must occur together. If either of these events does not occur, (b) becomes false, while (a) could still be true.\n\n5. Therefore, the probability of (a) is always greater than or equal to the probability of (b).\n\nSo, without needing to consider any other information or the likelihood of the individual events, we can conclude that (a) is more likely than (b).\n\nThe correct answer is (a) Demi's Lovelace role is rumoured to be filled by Chlo\u00eb Sevigny.",

        "init_model_answer": "Okay, let's analyze this step by step using probabilistic thinking:\n\n1. Option (a) states a single event: the girl's stepmother being indicted on a felony murder charge by a grand jury.\n\n2. Option (b) includes the event in option (a), but adds an additional condition or reason for the indictment: to prevent the stepmother from influencing the grandmother's trial outcome.\n\n3. Probabilistically, the likelihood of a single event (option a) is always greater than or equal to the likelihood of that event occurring in conjunction with another event or condition (option b).\n\n4. The additional condition in option (b) - the reason for the indictment being to prevent influence on the grandmother's trial - is an extra constraint that makes (b) less likely than (a) or at most equally likely.\n\n5. The background information about the girl's death and the grandmother facing charges is not directly relevant to determining the likelihood of the stepmother's indictment.\n\nTherefore, based on the laws of probability and ignoring the extraneous details, option (a) is more likely than option (b). The correct answer is (a): a grand jury indicts the girl's stepmother on a felony murder charge.",
