Premise 2: A subset of horses are fast runners.\n   This means that within the set of horses, there is a smaller set of horses that are fast runners.\n\n3. Conclusion: Therefore, a subset of foals are fast runners.\n   Since all foals are horses (Premise 1), and a subset of horses are fast runners (Premise 2), it logically follows that a subset of foals must also be fast runners.\n\nThe conclusion necessarily follows from the premises because if all foals are horses, and some horses are fast runners, then it must be true that some foals are also fast runners.

Conclusion: Therefore, a subset of shorts shrink when washed.\n   The conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nThe reasoning is as follows:\n- We know that all shorts are clothing (Premise 1).\n- We also know that some clothing items shrink when washed (Premise 2).\n- Since shorts are a type of clothing, and some clothing items shrink when washed, it logically follows that some shorts must also shrink when washed.\n\nThe key here is that the conclusion is not claiming that all shorts shrink when washed, but rather that a subset (some) of shorts do.
