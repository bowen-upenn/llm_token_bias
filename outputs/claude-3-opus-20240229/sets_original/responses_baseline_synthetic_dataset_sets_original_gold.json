The same logical structure applies to the argument about trains and electric-powered vehicles.\n\nTo conclude that some trains are electric-powered, we would need an additional premise that connects electric-powered vehicles to trains, such as \"Some electric-powered vehicles are trains.\" Without this, the argument commits the fallacy of the undistributed middle term.",
