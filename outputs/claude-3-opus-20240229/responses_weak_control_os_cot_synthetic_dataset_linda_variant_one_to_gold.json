Option (b) adds additional information: \"to avoid further dental issues like gingivitis.\" This is a more specific reason for why Marty would increase the reward.\n\n3. The question stem already tells us that Rick got gingivitis as a result of not flossing. So the information in option (b) about avoiding further dental issues is redundant - we already know this from the question itself.\n\n4. Option (a) is more concise and does not include the redundant information. It is a simpler statement.\n\n5. Importantly, option (b) is a subset of option (a).

The key difference is that option (b) adds the reason \"to avoid the risk of further embarrassment.\"\n\n2. The passage tells us that Amelia's singing clip was shown as a blooper, which would likely be quite embarrassing for her. It's reasonable to infer that this negative experience could discourage her from competing again.\n\n3. However, option (b) assumes the specific reason for Amelia stopping competitions is to avoid further embarrassment. While this is a plausible reason, the passage doesn't explicitly confirm it. There could be other reasons she stops competing, such as losing confidence or interest.\n\n4. Option (a) makes a more general statement that Amelia would likely stop competing, without specifying the reason. This aligns with the information given in the passage, without making additional assumptions.\n\n5. This question is a Linda Problem, designed to test the conjunction fallacy. The conjunction fallacy occurs when we assume that specific conditions are more probable than a single general one.

Option (a) states that Erin might take a photo of the new skirt to share online. This is a reasonable action for someone who is proud of their work and wants to show it off.\n\n3. Option (b) is more specific. It states that Erin might take a photo of the new skirt to share online to get feedback from her online sewing group. While this is also a reasonable action, it's a more specific scenario than option (a).\n\n4. The conjunction fallacy tells us that people tend to think that specific conditions are more probable than general ones. However, in reality, the probability of two events occurring together (in \"conjunction\") is always less than or equal to the probability of either one occurring alone.\n\n5. In this case, option (b) is a subset of option (a). Every time Erin shares a photo of her skirt with her online sewing group, she is also sharing a photo online. But not every time she shares a photo online is she necessarily sharing it with her sewing group.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) Erin might take a photo of the new skirt to share online. This general scenario is more probable than the specific one outlined in option (b).",

Option (b) is more specific, stating that they would want to visit another fair or carnival specifically to ride more rides.

Anyone who visits a fair to ride more rides (b) would also be visiting a fair soon (a). However, someone could visit a fair soon (a) for other reasons, not just to ride rides.\n\nTherefore, option (a) is more likely: based on their positive overall experience, the protagonist would likely visit another fair or carnival soon. Option (b) is too specific and restrictive compared to the more general and inclusive option (a).",

The background information tells us the protagonist and their brother are not very close - they only see each other about once every other year since their parents' divorce when the protagonist was 14. \n\n3. The protagonist expresses a wish to know their brother better, suggesting they would like to have a closer relationship. Planning a visit would align with this desire.\n\n4. However, the brother lives six hours away, which is a significant distance. This might make frequent visits difficult or unlikely.\n\n5. The brother purchasing a house could certainly be an occasion to prompt a visit from the protagonist. However, given their historically infrequent contact, it's not certain the protagonist would plan a visit specifically to celebrate this milestone.\n\n6.

The additional information in option (b) does not change the probability of the event occurring. Tom calling security or the police is the core event, regardless of his specific reason for doing so.\n\n3. According to the conjunction rule in probability theory, the probability of two events occurring together (a conjunction) is always less than or equal to the probability of either event occurring alone. In other words, P(A and B) \u2264 P(A) and P(A and B) \u2264 P(B).\n\n4. In this case, option (b) is a conjunction of two events: Tom calling security or the police, AND his reason being to ensure the safety of all staff members. Option (a) only includes the event of Tom calling security or the police.\n\n5. Therefore, the probability of (a) must be greater than or equal to the probability of (b).\n\nBased on this analysis, the most likely answer is (a) The protagonist, Tom, would likely call security or the police to handle the situation.",

Taking photographs of memorable, beautiful scenes is a common human behavior.\n\n4) However, the passage provides no information about the protagonist's social media habits or even access to social media. We cannot assume they would post the photo online just because they took it.\n\n5) Posting on social media is an additional specific action that is not directly supported by the information provided, whereas simply taking the photo is a more general action that aligns with the focus on the visual beauty.\n\nTherefore, option (a) \"The protagonist would likely take a photograph of the scenery\" is more probable based solely on the given information.

However, at the gift opening, Tom realized all the other gifts were 'Roll Tide' themed. 'Roll Tide' is the rallying cry for the University of Alabama's sports teams, most notably the Alabama Crimson Tide football team.\n\n3. This suggests that when Tom's sister said her husband loves Alabama, she likely meant he's a fan of the University of Alabama football team, not necessarily the state or its music.\n\n4. Given this misunderstanding, Tom would likely feel his gift was inappropriate and would want to rectify the situation.\n\n5. Both options (a) and (b) involve Tom apologizing for the misunderstanding and offering to exchange the gift.

Since the context clues (the 'Roll Tide' themed gifts) strongly suggest that Tom's brother-in-law is a fan of the Alabama Crimson Tide football team, the more specific and contextualized option (b) is more probable.\n\nTherefore, the more likely scenario is (b) Tom would apologize for the misunderstanding and offer to exchange the gift to get something related to the Alabama Crimson Tide football team.",
