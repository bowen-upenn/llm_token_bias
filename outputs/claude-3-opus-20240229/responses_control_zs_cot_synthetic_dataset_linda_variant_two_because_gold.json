Option (b) is a conjunction of two events: \n   - The family learning to budget and save\n   - Rob LeBlanc understanding the importance of financial responsibility after their circumstances changed\n\n4. Based on the basic probability rule, the probability of a conjunction P(A and B) is always less than or equal to the probabilities of its constituents, P(A) or P(B).\n\n5.

Mudslides will remain a threat for the next few days, AND \n2. The heavy rains have already saturated the soil and increased the risk of further mudslides.\n\nAccording to probability theory, the probability of a conjunction P(A and B) is always less than or equal to the probability of its individual constituents P(A) or P(B).\n\nTherefore, the probability of (b) cannot be greater than the probability of (a), since (b) contains (a) as well as an additional condition.\n\nThe background information about the heavy rains and saturated soil, while potentially relevant, does not change the fundamental probability rule. We should base our answer solely on the probability of the events, not how representative or plausible they seem given the context.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (a). Mudslides will remain a threat for the next few days is more likely than the conjunction in (b).",
