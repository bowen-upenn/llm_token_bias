Given these principles, even though both options are plausible, option (a) is more likely as it makes fewer assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is (a) The protagonist would likely contact their professor to explain the situation and request a makeup exam.",

Both options state that Jenny would buy more dog food. The difference is that option (b) adds the reason \"because the dog liked the rice.\"\n\n4. While it's good that the dog enjoyed the rice, it's not a typical or complete diet for dogs. Dog food is specifically formulated to meet a dog's nutritional needs.\n\n5. As a responsible pet owner, Jenny is likely to buy more dog food regardless of whether the dog liked the rice or not, because she knows that dog food is the appropriate regular diet for her pet.\n\n6. The dog liking the rice is additional information that doesn't necessarily affect Jenny's decision to buy more dog food.\n\nTherefore, option (a) \"Jenny would buy more dog food\" is more likely, as it doesn't rely on the additional condition of the dog liking the rice.",

From the information given, we know that:\n   - Nina had never taken the subway before\n   - She found the experience wasn't difficult\n   - She realized this while sitting during the commute\n\n3. Based on this, it's reasonable to infer that Nina had a positive first experience with the subway. This makes it likely she would consider using it again in the future.\n\n4. However, option (b) makes a more specific claim about her reasoning. While the story suggests the subway was easier than she expected, it doesn't explicitly say anything about efficiency or stress.\n\n5. Option (a) only states that she's likely to use the subway again, without specifying why. This is a safer inference based on the information given.\n\nTherefore, while both (a) and (b) could be true, (a) is more probable given the information provided in the story.

The board unfortunately broke during one of his tricks. This was an accident and not due to Reese's lack of interest in skateboarding.\n\n4. Given Reese's dedication to save up for the board, and his excitement to use it, it's likely that one accident wouldn't deter him from skateboarding altogether.\n\n5. While both options indicate Reese would likely buy a new skateboard, option (b) provides the additional relevant context that he wouldn't give up skateboarding just because of one accident, which aligns with his demonstrated dedication and enthusiasm.\n\nTherefore, while both (a) and (b) are probable, I believe (b) is more likely: \"Reese would likely buy a new skateboard because he doesn't want to give up skateboarding just because of one accident.\"",

Jumping into the shower indicates she wants to quickly get away from the area where the spiders are dropping.\n\n2. Since multiple spiders have already dropped on her, it's reasonable to assume Xena would want to wash off any other spiders that might be on her body that she hasn't noticed yet. Turning on the shower water would help do this.\n\n3. Even if there aren't other spiders on her, Xena is probably feeling \"crawly\" or \"itchy\" just from the thought of spiders being on her. Running water from the shower could provide a feeling of cleaning off that sensation, even if no spiders are actually there.\n\n4. Hiding in the shower without the water running wouldn't be as effective at washing away spiders or providing that cleansing feeling as actually turning on the water would be.\n\n5. Therefore, given Xena's startled and fearful reaction, and her quick decision to jump into the shower to get away from the spiders, it seems more likely that she would indeed turn on the shower water to wash away any potential spiders on her body and to get that physical sensation of washing away the spiders.\n\nSo in conclusion, (b) is the more likely scenario - Xena would likely turn on the shower water because she wanted to wash away any other spiders that might be on her.

The man got a tattoo of his girlfriend's name.\n2. The girlfriend broke up with him.\n3. The man went back to the tattoo artist to modify the tattoo.\n4. The tattoo artist changed the tattoo into an eagle.\n\nStep 1: Consider the man's motivation for getting the tattoo modified.\nIt's reasonable to assume that the man wanted to change the tattoo because it reminded him of his ex-girlfriend and their failed relationship. He likely wanted to replace the painful memory with something else.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the new tattoo's significance.\nAn eagle tattoo is a common choice and often symbolizes freedom, strength, and a new beginning. It's a significant change from the previous tattoo of his girlfriend's name.\n\nStep 3: Compare the two options.\n(a) The protagonist might show off his new eagle tattoo.\nThis option suggests that the man is proud of his new tattoo and wants to display it, but it doesn't provide any context about why he got the tattoo modified.\n\n(b) The protagonist might show off his new eagle tattoo because he wants to cover up the painful memory of his past relationship.\nThis option not only suggests that the man is proud of his new tattoo but also provides context about his motivation for getting it modified. It ties together the information given in the prompt.\n\nConclusion:\nOption (b) is more likely because it considers the man's motivation for modifying the tattoo and connects it to his desire to show off the new eagle tattoo.

The fact that Neil suddenly panicked and froze during the first measure of Purple Rain suggests that something unexpected and powerful triggered this reaction. It's unlikely that simply forgetting lyrics in the past would cause such a strong reaction, given Neil's outgoing nature.\n\n3. When someone experiences a sudden, unexpected panic reaction, it's common to seek reassurance or support from trusted friends or people nearby. This is a natural human response to fear or distress.\n\n4. Option (b) tries to explain Neil's reaction by referencing a past embarrassing incident. However, this explanation seems unlikely given what we know about Neil's personality and his lack of embarrassment in general.\n\n5. Option (a) doesn't try to explain the cause of Neil's panic, but focuses on his likely immediate response - seeking help and reassurance from his friends who are with him.\n\nBased on this analysis, option (a) seems more likely: Neil would seek help or reassurance from his friends.

The additional information in option (b) about Marci being worried that the object might have been harmful doesn't add much to the probability of her checking on the dog.

The passage tells us that Pete wanted to move to the city and found a place in Brooklyn, but it was too expensive for him to afford on his own. \n\n2. Faced with this obstacle, Pete had a few potential options:\n   (a) Look for more affordable housing in Brooklyn\n   (b) Consider finding a roommate to split costs\n   (c) Give up on Brooklyn and move back to New Jersey\n\n3.

The difference is that scenario (b) provides a reason - because they were exhausted from their busy day and needed to recover.\n\n3. The additional information in (b) does not make the scenario more or less probable than (a). It simply provides a rationale for why the person would sleep in or rest.\n\n4. In fact, adding this extra detail makes scenario (b) less probable than (a) according to probability theory. This is because (b) is a more specific case of (a). All instances of (b) are also instances of (a), but not all instances of (a) are instances of (b).\n\n5.

The key difference is that option (b) provides a reason - that he still holds the same beliefs and attitudes that initially led him to crime.\n\n2. The question states that Jeremy is currently in jail at age 35 and is categorized as a career criminal. This suggests a long pattern of criminal behavior since his youth.\n\n3. However, the question does not provide any information about Jeremy's current beliefs and attitudes. We don't know if they have changed during his time in jail or remained the same as when he first started committing crimes as a youth.\n\n4. Option (b) makes an additional assumption about Jeremy's current mindset that is not supported by the information provided. We cannot conclude he holds the same beliefs from the passage alone.\n\n5. Option (a) makes no such unsupported assumptions. It only states the likelihood of recidivism based on Jeremy's long criminal history, which is supported by the facts presented.\n\nTherefore, (a) is more likely to be correct based solely on the information provided in the question. Selecting (b) would be making an additional unsupported inference about Jeremy's current beliefs and attitudes.",

Paul's mom allowed him to get a hermit crab, likely because it wouldn't trigger her allergies. \n\n3. The passage states that the crab was \"silly and fun to play with.\" This directly tells us that Paul enjoyed playing with his new pet.\n\n4.
