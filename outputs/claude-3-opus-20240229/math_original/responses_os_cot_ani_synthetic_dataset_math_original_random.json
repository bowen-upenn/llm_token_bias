This will require 6 races, one for each group.\n\nStep 3: Race the top 3 hyenas from each group.\nAfter Step 2, we will have the top 3 hyenas from each of the 6 groups, which means we have 18 hyenas left. We can race these 18 hyenas in 3 more races, each with 6 hyenas.\n\nStep 4: Identify the overall top 3 hyenas.\nFrom the 3 races in Step 3, we can identify the top 3 hyenas overall, as they will be the fastest among the 18 hyenas raced.\n\nTherefore, the total number of races needed is:\n6 races (Step 2) + 3 races (Step 3) = 9 races\n\nSo, you need 9 races to find the fastest 3 hyenas in a group of 36 hyenas, racing 6 hyenas at a time.",
