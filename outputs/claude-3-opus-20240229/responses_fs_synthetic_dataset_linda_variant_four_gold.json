While it may seem intuitively more likely that a Robert Downey Jr. action movie would gross over $500 million despite poor reviews (given his track record with films like the Iron Man and Avengers series), option (b) cannot be more probable than option (a).\n\nThis is because option (b) contains an additional condition - not only must the movie receive poor reviews, but it also needs to gross over $500 million. Probability theory dictates that the probability of two events both occurring (a conjunction) will always be less than or equal to the probability of either one occurring alone.\n\nSo even if poorly reviewed Robert Downey Jr. action movies have often made over $500 million, the probability of that conjunction (poor reviews AND over $500M gross) cannot exceed the probability of just getting poor reviews by itself. Therefore, (a) must be more likely than (b).",
