While this is possible, it's an additional specific condition that makes the overall probability lower than option (a).\n\nStep 3: Identify the conjunction fallacy\n- Option (b) falls into the conjunction fallacy trap by adding an extra condition (catching up on schoolwork) to the original condition (staying at home while grounded).\n- According to the conjunction rule, the probability of two events occurring together (A and B) is always less than or equal to the probability of either event occurring alone (A or B).\n\nTherefore, I would select option (a) as the more likely scenario. Shane might stay at home while grounded, but adding the specific condition of catching up on schoolwork makes option (b) less probable due to the conjunction fallacy.",

These symptoms can be potentially serious and would likely worry most people.\n\n2) Given the severity of her reaction, it's very probable that Sally would seek medical attention to get her symptoms under control and ensure there are no further complications. This is just common sense when dealing with a significant allergic reaction.\n\n3) While it's possible Sally might be additionally motivated to seek treatment so as not to miss work the next day, the primary and most likely reason for seeking medical care would simply be to treat the allergic reaction itself, regardless of her work schedule. \n\n4) The additional detail about wanting to treat the reaction to avoid missing work is an extra assumption that isn't necessary to explain the likelihood of her seeking treatment. It's an additional condition that makes the scenario more specific and therefore less probable than the more general scenario of just seeking treatment for the reaction alone.\n\n5) This is an example of the conjunction fallacy, where a more specific scenario is judged to be more probable than a more general one, even though in probability theory, the probability of a conjunction (A and B) cannot exceed the probability of its constituents (A alone).\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is (a) Sally would seek medical attention for her allergic reaction. The additional condition related to her work schedule is extraneous and makes option (b) less likely than (a).",

This suggests she was predisposed to not enjoying such an experience.\n\n2. When she did ride the roller coaster, she hated the experience, confirming her fears and discomfort.\n\n3. The physical reaction of throwing up immediately after the ride indicates a strong negative physiological response to the experience.\n\n4. Lilly's vow to never go on a roller coaster again shows a strong determination to avoid repeating the experience.\n\nNow, let's look at the two options:\n\n(a) This option simply states that Lilly would avoid roller coasters in the future, which is consistent with her vow and negative experience.\n\n(b) While this option includes the same statement as (a), it also adds specific reasons for avoiding roller coasters - to avoid feeling nauseous and scared.\n\nHere's the key: Option (b) is a subset of option (a). Everyone who avoids roller coasters to not feel nauseous and scared (b) is also someone who avoids roller coasters (a). But not everyone who avoids roller coasters (a) necessarily does so to avoid nausea and fear.\n\nTherefore, option (a) is more probable as it encompasses all reasons for avoiding roller coasters, including but not limited to the specific reasons in (b).\n\nSo, I would select option (a) as the more likely scenario. This question demonstrates the conjunction fallacy, where people tend to think more specific scenarios are more likely than general ones, even though the opposite is true.",

Option (b) also states that Kim would likely prepare for the arrival of her baby, but it adds the specific detail that she would decorate the nursery based on the baby's gender.\n\n3. Option (b) is a more specific case of option (a). Every instance of (b) is also an instance of (a), but not vice versa.\n\n4. According to the rules of probability, the probability of a specific event (b) cannot be greater than the probability of a more general event (a) that includes the specific event.\n\nTherefore, option (a) is more likely than option (b). The addition of the specific detail in option (b) makes it a subset of option (a), and hence, less likely or at most equally likely.",
