However, coma is a rare and severe complication that only occurs in a small percentage of Hepatitis E cases, typically in pregnant women or individuals with pre-existing liver conditions.\n\nSince the question doesn't provide additional information about the man's health status or complications, the likelihood of him experiencing only jaundice is higher than experiencing both jaundice and coma together.",

This is because the combined scenario (b) is a subset of the single condition scenario (a).\n\nTherefore, even though the additional detail in option (b) may make it seem more plausible, probability tells us that option (a) must be more likely, or at the very least, equally likely.\n\nSo the correct answer is (a) She also experiences breathlessness.",

This is because the bleeding in the brain typically affects one hemisphere, leading to contralateral (opposite side) weakness or paralysis.\n\nWhile headaches can also occur with brain hemorrhages, they are not as directly related to the paralysis as the weakness on one side of the body.
