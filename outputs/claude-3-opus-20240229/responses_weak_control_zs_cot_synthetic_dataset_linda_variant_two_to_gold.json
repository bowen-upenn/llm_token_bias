The conjunction fallacy occurs when we assume that specific conditions are more probable than a single general one.\n\n2. Option (a) is a general statement: \"Denuta, 62, felt neglected as she raised their eight children.\"\n\n3. Option (b) is a more specific version of (a), with an additional condition: \"Denuta, 62, felt neglected as she raised their eight children to become successful, independent adults.\"\n\n4. Logically, the probability of two events occurring together (in \"conjunction\") is always less than or equal to the probability of either one occurring alone.\n\n5. Therefore, the probability of Denuta feeling neglected while raising eight children to become successful, independent adults (two conditions) is less than or equal to the probability of her feeling neglected while raising eight children (one condition).\n\n6. So, even if we feel that option (b) is more representative or characteristic of Denuta based on our stereotypes or intuitions, it is still logically less likely than option (a).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) Denuta, 62, felt neglected as she raised their eight children. This is more likely than option (b).",

This is a single event.\n\n3) Option (b) states that IHOP will give away pancakes on February 24 (same as option a) AND that this giveaway will be to raise money for charity. This is a compound event - it's the intersection of two events.\n\n4) Probability theory dictates that the probability of the intersection of two events is always less than or equal to the probability of either event alone. In other words, P(A and B) \u2264 P(A) and P(A and B) \u2264 P(B).\n\n5) Therefore, the probability of IHOP giving away pancakes on February 24 to raise money for charity (option b) is always less than or equal to the probability of IHOP just giving away pancakes on February 24 (option a).\n\n6) Thus, option (a) is more likely than option (b).\n\nThe correct answer is (a) Competitor IHOP to give away pancakes on February 24.",

However, \"major\" hurricanes are defined as Category 3, 4 or 5 storms, not just Category 5.\n\n3) Option (a) states that the warm temperatures are expected to boost storms in general, without specifying the intensity. This aligns with the prediction of several major hurricanes.\n\n4) Option (b), on the other hand, specifically states that the storms will be boosted to Category 5 intensity. This is a more specific and extreme case compared to option (a).\n\n5) In probability theory, a more general event is always at least as likely as a more specific event. In other words, the probability of a subset (Category 5 storms) cannot be greater than the probability of the set that contains it (all boosted storms).\n\n6) Therefore, option (a) is more likely than option (b).\n\nThis is an example of the conjunction fallacy, where people tend to think that a more specific scenario is more probable than a more general one, even though the opposite is true.",

Option (a) states that \"Cervarix will be available later this year, according to GlaxoSmithKline\". This aligns with the information provided about the FDA approving GlaxoSmithKline's HPV vaccine Cervarix.\n\n2. Option (b) includes the same statement as (a), but adds \"to help prevent cervical cancer and flu symptoms.\" While the given information does mention that Cervarix is designed to help prevent cervical cancer, there is no mention of it helping with flu symptoms.\n\n3. The conjunction fallacy occurs when we assume that specific conditions are more probable than a single general one. In this case, option (b) is a more specific statement compared to option (a).\n\n4. Logically, the probability of two events occurring together (Cervarix preventing cervical cancer AND flu symptoms) is always less than or equal to the probability of either one occurring alone.\n\nTherefore, option (a) is more likely than option (b). The additional information in (b) about flu symptoms makes it less probable, as it's an unsupported claim that makes the statement more specific.",
