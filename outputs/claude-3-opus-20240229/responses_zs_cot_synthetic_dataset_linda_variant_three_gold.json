Loss of appetite is a common symptom of Hepatitis B, as the liver plays a crucial role in digestion and metabolism. When the liver is inflamed due to the viral infection, it can lead to a decrease in appetite.\n\n3. Itching, also known as pruritus, is a less common symptom of Hepatitis B compared to loss of appetite.

It is more common in older adults, and women are more likely to develop arthritis than men.\n\n2. There are different types of arthritis, but the most common types are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoarthritis usually affects the hands, knees, hips, and spine, while rheumatoid arthritis typically affects the hands, wrists, and feet.\n\n3. Stiffness is a common symptom of arthritis, particularly in the morning or after periods of inactivity. This stiffness can affect the joints as well as the surrounding muscles.\n\n4. While neck stiffness can be a symptom of certain types of arthritis, such as cervical spondylosis or rheumatoid arthritis, it is not as common as stiffness in other joints like the hands, knees, or hips.\n\n5. Movement stiffness, or a general feeling of stiffness throughout the body, is a more common symptom of arthritis than isolated neck stiffness.\n\nGiven the information provided and the reasoning above, the most likely answer is:\n\n(a) She also experiences a stiff neck and movement stiffness.\n\nThis is because movement stiffness is a more common and generalized symptom of arthritis, while neck stiffness, although possible, is less common and more specific to certain types of arthritis.",

As the condition progresses, it can lead to the following symptoms:\n   - Neck pain and stiffness\n   - Headaches\n   - Grinding or popping noise when turning the neck\n   - Muscle weakness\n   - Numbness or tingling sensations in the shoulders, arms, or hands\n\n3.

While both options include neck pain, which is a common symptom of cervical spondylosis, option (a) also includes weakness in limbs.\n\n5. Weakness in limbs is a possible symptom of cervical spondylosis, but it typically occurs in more advanced stages of the condition when there is significant pressure on the nerves or spinal cord.\n\n6.

Coma, on the other hand, is a rare and severe complication of Hepatitis E. It may occur in cases of fulminant hepatic failure, which is a rapid deterioration of liver function.

This happens because the heart is not able to pump blood effectively, leading to fluid buildup in the lungs.\n\n3. Sweating is another typical symptom that often accompanies a heart attack. This is due to the body's stress response and the activation of the \"fight or flight\" system.\n\n4.
