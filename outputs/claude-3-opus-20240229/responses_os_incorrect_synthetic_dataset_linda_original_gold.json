        "question": "Raj is a 28-year-old guy with a passion for computer science and mathematics. He graduated with a double major in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. Raj is known for his analytical mind, attention to detail, and love for problem-solving. In his free time, he enjoys coding personal projects, playing video games, and exploring different programming languages. Raj also has a strong interest in astronomy and often spends his evenings stargazing with his telescope. With his friendly and approachable demeanor, Raj is always willing to help his friends and classmates with challenging coding tasks.\n\nWhich is more probable?\n(a) Raj is a passenger vehicle driver.\n(b) Raj is a passenger vehicle driver and enjoys participating in hackathons and coding competitions.",

        "use_multi_agents": false,
        "init_model_answer": "While the additional details about Raj's interests and personality are compelling, we should be cautious about letting them lead us astray. The correct answer is:\n\n(a) Raj is a passenger vehicle driver.\n\nHere's why: The description of Raj strongly suggests he would enjoy and likely participate in coding competitions. However, that doesn't make (b) more probable than (a).\n\nTo see this, consider that only a tiny fraction of people participate in coding competitions, but a very large fraction of people are passenger vehicle drivers. Even if Raj is much more likely than the average person to participate in hackathons, the probability that he is a vehicle driver is still higher, simply because that is so much more common in the general population.\n\nThis is a well-known cognitive bias called the conjunction fallacy. Adding more specificity to a description can make it feel more plausible, but it can't make it more probable than the simpler statement alone. The probability of two things being simultaneously true (Raj is a driver AND enjoys coding competitions) can never be higher than the probability of just one of those things being true (Raj is a driver).",

Sandeep is known for his wit, his passion for cooking, and his love for classic rock music.

Sandeep has a deep curiosity for technology and is always up-to-date with the latest gadgets and software trends. \nWhich is more probable?\n(a) Sandeep is an explosives worker.\n(b) Sandeep is an explosives worker and enjoys participating in charity marathons and fundraising events to combine his passion for technology with his love of giving back to the community.",

        "retry": false,
        "use_multi_agents": false,
        "init_model_answer": "This is a tricky question that relies on a cognitive bias known as the conjunction fallacy. The correct answer is actually:\n\n(a) Sandeep is an explosives worker.\n\nThe description of Sandeep doesn't provide any information to suggest he works with explosives. While the extra details in option (b) seem to fit well with his character, adding more specifics actually makes the scenario less probable overall.\n\nIn general, a conjunction of two events (A and B) cannot be more probable than either event alone. Sandeep being both an explosives worker AND someone who runs charity marathons is inherently less likely than him being just an explosives worker.\n\nSo even though (b) seems to paint a fuller, more coherent picture, probability theory dictates that (a) must be more likely, however slim the chances are. The conjunction fallacy tricks our mind into thinking the more detailed story is more probable. But mathematically, that cannot be true.",
