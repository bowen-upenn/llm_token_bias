Felony murder is a serious charge that can be brought against individuals who participate in a felony that results in someone's death, even if they did not directly cause the death.\n\nStep 2: Assess the likelihood of the stepmother being charged to prevent her from influencing the grandmother's trial.\nWhile it is possible that prosecutors might charge the stepmother to prevent her from influencing the grandmother's trial, this is not a typical reason for bringing charges. Charges are usually brought based on the evidence of the individual's involvement in the crime.\n\nStep 3: Compare the likelihood of the two options.\nOption (a) is more likely because if the evidence suggests that the stepmother was involved in the events leading to Savannah's death, she would likely face charges based on her own actions. Option (b) introduces an additional motive for the charges that is less common in the legal process.\n\nTherefore, option (a) \"A grand jury indicts the girl's stepmother on a felony murder charge\" is more likely based on the information provided.",

The passage mentions that it's unclear how many affected structures are residential homes, implying that there are various types of structures affected by the flooding, not just homes.\n\n2. The flooding was caused by the failure of the Lake Delhi dam due to heavy rainfall in the region.\n\n3. Iowa Governor Chet Culver plans to tour the affected region, suggesting that the flooding is significant and warrants attention from high-level officials.\n\nNow, let's look at the two options:\n\n(a) No injuries were reported in the flooding\n- This statement is more general and encompasses all affected structures, not just residential homes.\n- Given the severity of the flooding, it's possible that no injuries were reported overall.\n\n(b) No injuries were reported in the flooding to residential homes specifically\n- This statement is more specific, focusing only on residential homes affected by the flooding.\n- The passage doesn't provide clear information about the impact on residential homes or any injuries related to them.\n\nConsidering the lack of specific information about residential homes and injuries, option (a) appears more likely. The passage suggests a broad impact of the flooding, and stating that no injuries were reported in general seems more probable than specifying no injuries in residential homes.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, option (a) \"No injuries were reported in the flooding\" is more likely.",
