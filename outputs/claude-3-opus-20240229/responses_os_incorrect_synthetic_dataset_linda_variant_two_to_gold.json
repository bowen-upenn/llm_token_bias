This aligns with the first part of the information given, that NOAA is predicting 3-7 major hurricanes.\n\nOption (b) is more specific, saying the warm temperatures will boost storms specifically to category 5 intensity. However, category 5 is the highest level on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale. It's relatively rare to have even one Category 5 storm in a season, let alone multiple ones.\n\nSo while (b) is possible, (a) is the more likely scenario based on typical hurricane seasons. The warm waters will fuel an active hurricane season overall, but won't necessarily generate numerous Category 5 storms.\n\nTherefore, I believe the answer is (a) Unusually warm tropical Atlantic surface temperatures are expected to boost storms.
