It's compared to a \"canary in the coal mine\" signaling impending danger. This suggests the report likely states that human activities are causing temperatures to rise with high certainty.\n\nHowever, the details in (b) about temperature rises reaching critical levels that threaten global food security and cause severe weather patterns, while potentially true, are not explicitly backed up by the quotes provided. The passage does not specifically mention food security threats or altered weather patterns.\n\nTherefore, (a) sticks more closely to what can be reasonably inferred from the given information, while (b) inserts some additional claims that, although possibly correct, go beyond what is directly supported by the limited context.

This aligns with the first part of the information given, that NOAA is predicting 3-7 major hurricanes.\n\nOption (b) is more specific, saying the warm temperatures will boost storms specifically to category 5 intensity. However, category 5 is the highest level on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale. It's relatively rare to have even one Category 5 storm in a season, let alone multiple ones.\n\nSo while (b) is possible, (a) is the more likely scenario based on typical hurricane seasons. The warm waters will fuel an active hurricane season overall, but won't necessarily generate numerous Category 5 storms.\n\nTherefore, I believe the answer is (a) Unusually warm tropical Atlantic surface temperatures are expected to boost storms.
