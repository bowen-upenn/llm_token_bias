        "question": "Raj is a 28-year-old guy with a passion for computer science and mathematics. He graduated with a double major in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. Raj is known for his analytical mind, attention to detail, and love for problem-solving. In his free time, he enjoys coding personal projects, playing video games, and exploring different programming languages. Raj also has a strong interest in astronomy and often spends his evenings stargazing with his telescope. With his friendly and approachable demeanor, Raj is always willing to help his friends and classmates with challenging coding tasks.\n\nWhich is more probable?\n(a) Raj is a passenger vehicle driver.\n(b) Raj is a passenger vehicle driver and enjoys participating in hackathons and coding competitions.",

Which is more probable?\n(a) Dwayne is a tile and stone setter.\n(b) Dwayne is a tile and stone setter and enjoys exploring different cuisines and experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen.",

        "init_model_answer": "The correct answer is (a) Dwayne is a tile and stone setter.\n\nThe additional detail about Dwayne enjoying exploring cuisines and experimenting with recipes is irrelevant to determining his occupation. The conjunction of two details (one relevant and one irrelevant to his occupation) cannot be more probable than a single relevant detail alone.\n\nThis question illustrates the conjunction fallacy - the tendency to believe that specific conditions are more probable than general ones. Just because the second option provides more details does not make it inherently more likely to be true compared to the first option with fewer details.",

They are passionate about conservation efforts and marine life protection. Sione enjoys participating in beach clean-up efforts to contribute to environmental preservation. \nWhich is more probable?\n(a) Sione is a model maker and patternmaker.\n(b) Sione is a model maker and patternmaker and enjoys participating in beach clean-up efforts to contribute to environmental preservation.",

        "init_model_answer": "The correct answer is (a) Sione is a model maker and patternmaker.\n\nThis question follows the same pattern as the Linda problem, where the conjunction of two probabilities (Sione being a model maker and patternmaker AND participating in beach clean-ups) is less likely than just one of those probabilities alone (Sione being a model maker and patternmaker).\n\nEven though Sione's background and interests align with environmental preservation and beach clean-up efforts, the addition of a specific occupation (model maker and patternmaker) makes the conjunct probability (b) less likely than the single probability (a), according to probability theory.",

Sandeep is known for his wit, his passion for cooking, and his love for classic rock music. In his free time, he enjoys tending to his vegetable garden, playing soccer with his kids, and volunteering at local community events. Sandeep has a deep curiosity for technology and is always up-to-date with the latest gadgets and software trends. \nWhich is more probable?\n(a) Sandeep is an explosives worker.\n(b) Sandeep is an explosives worker and enjoys participating in charity marathons and fundraising events to combine his passion for technology with his love of giving back to the community.",

Adding extra details to that unlikely scenario doesn't make it more probable than the simpler unlikely statement alone.",
