Celebrating his birthday alone could be seen as an act of defiance, without an explicit protest message about his political stance.\n\nHowever, more context would be needed to say definitively.

For a competitor like IHOP to respond, it seems more probable that they would tie their own pancake giveaway to a charitable cause rather than simply giving away food for free. Partnering the promotion with a charity fundraiser provides additional positive publicity and rationale for the event beyond just competing with Denny's promotion head-on. So while IHOP certainly could decide to hand out free pancakes to directly rival Denny's, doing it as a charity event seems like the more likely competitive response given the details provided.",
