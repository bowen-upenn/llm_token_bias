It would make sense that other restaurant owners in the area might take notice and also adopt similar measures in response to the flu, leading the Thai restaurant owner to observe \"a big response\" from them.\n\nOption (b) introduces an irrelevant detail about the restaurant adopting a pet goldfish named Bubbles, which does not logically connect to other owners having a big response to their flu prevention measures.",
