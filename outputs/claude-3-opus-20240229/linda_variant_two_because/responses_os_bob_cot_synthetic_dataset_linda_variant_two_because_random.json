The question states that Qatar offered to re-establish trade relations with Israel and provide economic aid to Gaza.\n\n2. It's known that Hamas, which is considered a terrorist organization by many countries including Israel, controls Gaza.\n\n3. Option (a) suggests that Israeli officials fear any aid to Gaza would bolster Hamas. This is a reasonable concern for Israel given Hamas's control over Gaza and the tense relations between Israel and Hamas.\n\n4. Option (b) adds additional information - that Qatar has a new emir who is eager to improve relations in the region. While this could potentially be a factor, the statement in option (a) stands on its own as a likely concern for Israel, independent of the new emir's intentions.\n\n5. Occam's razor principle suggests that when faced with competing hypotheses, one should select the solution with the fewest assumptions. In this case, option (a) makes fewer assumptions compared to option (b).\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and the reasoning above, option (a) \"Israel fears any aid would bolster Hamas, officials say\" is more likely than option (b).",

Receiving a SAG Life Achievement Award indicates she had a successful and acclaimed acting career.\n3. It's reasonable that she might rank her role in one of her most famous and beloved movies as a personal favorite.\n4. The additional detail in option (b) about baking cookies on Sundays seems irrelevant to her acting career or personal favorite roles.\n\nTherefore, option (a) \"Actress ranks 'Singin' in the Rain' as her favorite role\" is more likely, as it logically connects to the information provided about Debbie Reynolds receiving the SAG Life Achievement Award. The extra information in option (b) does not have a clear connection or relevance.\n\nSo the answer is (a) Actress ranks \"Singin' in the Rain' as her favorite role.",

They enforce rules on women's clothing, such as wearing socks, headscarves, and prohibiting bras.\n3. They use violence to enforce these rules, as evidenced by the mention of men with whips in the streets.\n4. These actions, including the use of violence and strict control over the population, are typical of groups designated as terrorist organizations.\n\n(b) Al-Shabaab is considered a terrorist organization by the United States because they prefer hot sauce on their pizza.\n\n1.

MacDonald maintains his innocence and has accused the author McGinniss of betraying him, suggesting there was some prior relationship or interaction between them.\n\n3.

Cynthia McKinney, a former U.S. Representative, was on a boat that violated Israel's blockade and entered Gazan waters. It's common for activists and human rights groups to attempt to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza, as the region has been under a strict blockade by Israel. So, it makes sense that a human rights group would state the ship's purpose was to deliver humanitarian aid.\n\n(b) Human rights group says ship was carrying humanitarian aid to Gaza because the captain of the ship is a skilled cook.\n\nWhile this option also mentions the ship carrying humanitarian aid, the reason provided - that the captain is a skilled cook - seems irrelevant and unlikely to be the reason stated by a human rights group. The cooking skills of the captain don't have a clear connection to the ship's purpose of delivering aid.\n\nTherefore, option (a) is more likely, as it provides a logical and contextually relevant statement that a human rights group would plausibly make in this situation, without including any unlikely or irrelevant details.",

Option (b) has the same promise but adds \"because he feels confident wearing his lucky socks.\" This addition seems flippant and inappropriate given the seriousness of the oil disaster and Hayward's precarious public standing. It's unlikely a major company ad would include such a trivial, superstitious reason.\n\n5. Therefore, option (a), the simple, serious promise, is much more likely to be what Hayward and BP would put in an official ad, rather than (b) with the odd mention of lucky socks.\n\nSo in conclusion, (a) is the more likely option based on the context provided.",
