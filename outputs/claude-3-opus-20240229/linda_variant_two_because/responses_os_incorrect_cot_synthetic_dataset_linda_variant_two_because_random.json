This suggests there were previously trade relations between Qatar and Israel that had been suspended or broken off.\n\n2. Qatar also wanted to provide economic aid to Gaza. Gaza is a Palestinian territory governed by Hamas, which Israel considers a terrorist organization.\n\n3. Option (a) states that Israel fears any aid would bolster Hamas. This aligns with the context - Israel likely sees economic aid to Gaza as potentially strengthening Hamas.\n\n4. Option (b) adds additional information - that Qatar has a new emir who is eager to improve relations in the region. While this could be a factual statement, it is not directly supported by the information provided in the question.\n\n5. When considering which option is more likely, we should rely on the information given. Option (a) directly follows from the context provided, while option (b) introduces new information that we can't verify based on the question alone.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, option (a) \"Israel fears any aid would bolster Hamas, officials say\" is more likely to be true than option (b).",

The question is asking about Debbie Reynolds, a well-known actress, receiving the SAG Life Achievement Award, which is a significant recognition in the acting profession.\n\n2. Option (a) states that the actress ranks her role in the classic musical film \"Singin' in the Rain\" as her favorite. This is a plausible statement, as \"Singin' in the Rain\" is a highly acclaimed film, and it would be reasonable for an actress to consider a role in such a film as a personal favorite.\n\n3. Option (b) also mentions the actress ranking \"Singin' in the Rain\" as her favorite role but adds an unrelated detail about her enjoying baking cookies on Sundays. This additional information seems irrelevant to the context of the question, which is focused on her acting career and the SAG Life Achievement Award.\n\n4. When comparing the two options, (a) is more concise and directly related to the context of the question, while (b) includes an unnecessary detail that does not contribute to the likelihood of the statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the relevance of each option, (a) is more likely: Actress ranks \"Singin' in the Rain\" as her favorite role.",

This suggests they are an extremist organization.\n\n2. The group is reported to have punished women for violating strict dress codes, including not wearing headscarves and wearing bras. Dispatching men with whips to enforce this also indicates the group uses violence and intimidation. \n\n3. The United States government typically designates groups as terrorist organizations if they engage in acts of violence, especially against civilians, to pursue political or ideological goals.\n\n4. There is no logical connection between the United States designating a group as a terrorist organization and that group's pizza topping preferences. This detail about hot sauce is absurd and irrelevant.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and reasonable inferences, the answer is clearly:\n\n(a) Al-Shabaab is considered a terrorist organization by the United States\n\nThe violent enforcement of strict laws and use of whippings against women for dress code violations aligns with extremist tactics that would likely result in the U.S. labeling Al-Shabaab a terrorist group.

Option (a) aligns with this context - a human rights group stating the ship was carrying humanitarian aid fits logically with the boat trying to enter Gaza despite the blockade.\n\n5. Option (b) adds an extra detail about the captain being a skilled cook.
