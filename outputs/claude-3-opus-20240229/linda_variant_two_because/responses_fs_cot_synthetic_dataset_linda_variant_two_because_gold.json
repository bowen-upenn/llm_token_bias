It is more probable for someone to simply state their favorite role than to elaborate on the reasons why in this context.\n\nTherefore, option (a) \"Actress ranks 'Singin' in the Rain' as her favorite role\" is more likely to be the correct answer.",

The passage mentions that the talks are between North and South Korea about reunions for families torn apart by the Korean War. It does not mention any third party involvement like the IRC (International Rescue Committee, I assume).\n\n3. Answer option (a) introduces the idea of the IRC sending delegates to mediate the talks in North Korea. This is new information not supported by the passage, making it less likely.\n\n4. Answer option (b) builds upon the unlikely scenario in (a) by adding an unsupported reason for IRC's involvement - a belief that it will lead to peaceful resolution. Adding more unsupported specifics makes an already unlikely scenario even less probable.\n\n5. Between the two options, (a) is less unlikely than (b), as (b) makes a bigger leap from the information given.\n\nTherefore, while neither scenario is likely based on the passage, the correct answer must be (a) IRC sending delegates to mediate the talks to be held in North Korea, as it is comparatively more probable than option (b).",

However, this detail is not supported by the information provided and seems to contradict the idea of an unexpected death.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and logical reasoning, the correct answer is more likely to be (a) The entertainer had struggled with addiction problems.",
