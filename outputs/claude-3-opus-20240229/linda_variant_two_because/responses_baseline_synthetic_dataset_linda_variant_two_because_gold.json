His lawyers characterizing this timing as an extortion attempt seems a plausible response, without making the additional claim in option (b) about her seeking revenge and trying to damage his reputation. While those could be potential motivations, option (a) is a more direct and likely initial response from his legal team to these public interviews.",

However, the brief excerpts do not give any information about potential motives or the progress of the police investigation. \n\nStating that no motive has been determined yet, specifically because the investigation is still in its early stages, is a reasonable and common way for news reports to convey that more time is needed to gather evidence and draw any conclusions about the perpetrator's possible motives. Option (b) adds that important context, making it the more informative and likely phrasing, in my assessment.",

These proactive steps go beyond what most restaurants would typically do, especially during a flu outbreak.\n\nIt's more likely that other restaurant owners would be impressed by these measures and respond positively, rather than simply noting a \"big response\" without a reason. The additional context in option (b) makes it the more probable scenario given the restaurant's actions to prevent the spread of the flu.",

Even though the evacuations have been lifted, the risk of mudslides persists due to the soil conditions. The winter storm warning for the Sierra Nevada also suggests that more precipitation is expected, which could further exacerbate the mudslide risk in the coming days.",
