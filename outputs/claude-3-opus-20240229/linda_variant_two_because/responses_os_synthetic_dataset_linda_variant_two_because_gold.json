The statement argues Rubio is putting politics over immigrant well-being, and urges him to instead use his office to properly prioritize these children's needs over political calculations, as doing so is rare for politicians.

The convenience factor likely plays a role.\n\n3) While tweets can provide direct insight into a politician's perspective, they are often quite biased and don't go through the same fact-checking rigor as journalists aim for in their own reporting. So journalists likely recognize tweets aren't always reliable sources on their own.\n\n4) Journalists aim to use reliable sources to inform their reporting, but may view politicians' tweets more as supplemental quotes or color rather than foundational reliable information.\n\nSo in summary, I believe journalists frequently include politician's tweets for valid journalistic reasons, but more as a convenient source of direct quotes than as a consistently reliable informational source.
