It would be logical and relevant for the restaurant owner to comment that other restaurant owners are also responding to the flu threat by taking similar precautions.\n\nOption (b) introduces an irrelevant detail about adopting a pet goldfish named Bubbles, which has no connection to the flu measures or the response from other restaurant owners. This additional unrelated information makes option (b) much less likely compared to the more straightforward and pertinent statement in option (a).",
