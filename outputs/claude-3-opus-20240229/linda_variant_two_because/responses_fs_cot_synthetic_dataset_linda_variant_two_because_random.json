In problems like this, the correct answer is typically the one that is fully relevant without introducing extraneous or irrelevant details. Adding extra details often makes an option less likely to be correct.\n\nTherefore, (a) \"Israel fears any aid would bolster Hamas, officials say\" is more likely to be the correct answer, as it provides directly relevant information without introducing tangential or unnecessary details.",

This logically follows from the points she made about countering misconceptions, highlighting the real drivers of food stamp use, and implying the program is necessary but could be improved.\n\n(b) Makes the same call for improving the program, but adds an odd non-sequitur about winning a cooking competition.

The United States generally considers groups to be terrorist organizations based on their use of violence, especially against civilians, to achieve political or ideological goals.\n\n4. It's highly unlikely that the United States would label a group a terrorist organization based on their pizza topping preferences, as this is not a serious criterion for such a designation.\n\nTherefore, option (a) \"Al-Shabaab is considered a terrorist organization by the United States\" is far more likely to be true based on the information provided. The group's strict enforcement of religious laws and use of violence against civilians who violate these laws aligns with common definitions of terrorism.\n\nOption (b) introduces an absurd and irrelevant detail about pizza toppings, which makes it much less likely to be a factual statement.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (a) Al-Shabaab is considered a terrorist organization by the United States.",

The question gives some key information: Monteith, an actor from Glee, was found dead in his hotel room after missing his checkout time. The director had spoken to him the day of his death and Monteith sounded happy. Police have ruled out foul play.\n\n2. Option (a) provides an additional relevant piece of information: Monteith, who was 31 years old, had spent time in rehab earlier that year. This suggests he may have struggled with substance abuse or addiction issues.\n\n3. Option (b) contains the same information as (a) about Monteith's time in rehab, but adds an irrelevant and oddly specific detail about playing with puppies in a park on a sunny day. This additional information does not fit logically with the rest of the known facts.\n\n4. Given that Monteith was found dead unexpectedly at a young age, and police have ruled out foul play, the fact that he had recently been in rehab points to a potential cause of death related to substance abuse or addiction.\n\n5. The added detail in option (b) about playing with puppies seems out of place and does not add any meaningful information to help answer the question of which scenario is more likely.\n\nTherefore, based on the relevant information provided and logical reasoning, the correct answer is (a) Monteith, 31, spent time in rehab this year.",

The passage provides context about BP CEO Tony Hayward testifying before a House subcommittee regarding the oil disaster.

Option (a) suggests that in a BP ad, Hayward promises, \"We will get this done.\" This aligns with the context of the oil disaster and Hayward's role as the CEO taking responsibility and committing to resolving the issue.\n\n3. Option (b) also starts with Hayward promising, \"We will get this done,\" but adds an unusual reason - \"because he feels confident wearing his lucky socks.\" There is no mention of lucky socks in the given context, and it seems unlikely for a CEO to publicly attribute a major corporate commitment to a personal superstition, especially in the midst of a serious crisis.\n\n4. Comparing the two options, (a) is much more likely and reasonable given the context. It's a straightforward and appropriate public statement for a CEO to make in response to a major issue his company is facing.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) In BP ad, Hayward promises, \"We will get this done.\"",

There is no information provided that suggests Mugabe's footwear would be a relevant factor at all.\n\n5. In contrast, while unlikely, option (a) is still comparatively more plausible than (b).

When a major sponsorship deal ends, it's common for speculation to arise about potential new sponsors.\n- Sahara (an Indian conglomerate) and Saudi Telecom (a large telecommunications company) are both feasible candidates given their size and potential interest in the exposure a Manchester United sponsorship would provide.\n\n(b) India's Sahara and Saudi Telecom have been tipped as potential sponsors because they both have logos that contain the color blue, which is Manchester United's primary color.\n\n- While it's true that Manchester United's primary color is blue, the color of a potential sponsor's logo is unlikely to be a major factor in sponsorship negotiations.\n- Sponsorship deals of this magnitude are generally based on financial considerations, brand synergy, and the sponsor's marketing strategies, rather than superficial factors like logo colors.\n- The reasoning given in this statement for why these companies are potential sponsors is far-fetched and unrealistic.\n\nTherefore, statement (a) is significantly more likely than statement (b).

Option (a) presents a plausible response from Strauss-Kahn's lawyers:\n   - They characterize the interviews as a \"last-ditch effort to extort money\"\n   - This suggests they believe the interviews are a tactic to pressure Strauss-Kahn, perhaps into a settlement\n   - Accusing an alleged victim of extortion or financial motivations is a common defense tactic\n\n3.
