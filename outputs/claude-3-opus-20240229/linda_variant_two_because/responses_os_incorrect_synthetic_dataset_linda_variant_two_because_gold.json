This aligns well with working for a renewable energy company.\n\n- He volunteers weekends at local park clean-ups and led a successful campaign to reduce his college campus's carbon footprint. This level of activism makes it likely he is an active member of a local environmental advocacy group.\n\nWhile option (b) is also quite possible given Bob's background, the additional detail in (a) about him being an active member of an advocacy group, which fits his profile, makes (a) the more likely scenario based on the information provided.",
