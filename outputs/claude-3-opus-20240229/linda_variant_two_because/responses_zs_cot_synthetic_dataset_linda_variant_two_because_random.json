Option (b) includes the same information as option (a) but adds an additional detail: that Qatar has a new emir who is eager to improve relations in the region.\n\n4. The additional information in option (b) provides a possible explanation for why Qatar is offering aid and seeking to re-establish trade relations.\n\n5. However, the question does not provide any information to confirm whether the new emir's eagerness to improve relations is the reason behind Qatar's offer.\n\n6. Option (a) directly addresses Israel's concern about the aid bolstering Hamas, which is a key factor in Israel's decision-making process regarding accepting aid for Gaza.\n\n7. While the new emir's desire to improve relations could be a contributing factor, it is not essential to explain Israel's fears about the aid strengthening Hamas.\n\nGiven the available information, option (a) is more likely because it directly addresses Israel's primary concern without relying on additional, unconfirmed information.\n\nTherefore, I select option (a): Israel fears any aid would bolster Hamas, officials say.",

Dr. Seuss books are beloved children's classics that are often read aloud by parents and public figures. The whimsical story of \"Green Eggs and Ham\" seems like an appropriate and entertaining choice for the occasion.\n\n(b) The claim that Obama read \"Green Eggs and Ham\" specifically because he once cooked and loved the dish seems much less likely. \"Green Eggs and Ham\" is a fictional story, not a recipe book. The green eggs and ham in the story are not meant to be taken literally as an actual dish. It's very unlikely Obama would have cooked this fictional meal for his family.\n\nAdditionally, option (b) provides an overly specific reason that seems unrealistic. Public figures usually select well-known children's books for these events, not because of a personal affinity for cooking the title dish.\n\nTherefore, option (a) is far more likely to be true compared to the elaborate backstory provided in option (b). The simpler, more straightforward explanation is almost certainly the correct one in this case.",

The given information about Al-Shabaab's violent and strict practices aligns with the characteristics of a terrorist organization, making it plausible that the United States would consider them as such. Option (b) is not supported by the provided information and appears to be a joke or a distraction from the serious nature of the topic.\n\nTherefore, the more likely answer is:\n(a) Al-Shabaab is considered a terrorist organization by the United States.",

The Republican Party (GOP) criticizing her record as Secretary of State regarding how she handled the Boko Haram terrorist group seems to be a political move to weaken her as a potential opponent.\n\n(b) The GOP attacks seek to weaken Clinton for her possible 2016 presidential run because she once wore a blue hat to a public event, and some people think blue hats are bad luck.\n\nThis option is quite far-fetched. While it also suggests the GOP attacks are to weaken Clinton for a possible presidential run, the stated reason - that she once wore a blue hat considered by some as bad luck - is not a serious or credible political critique. It's very unlikely that the GOP would base their attacks on such a trivial and superstitious reason.\n\nTherefore, after comparing the two options, I select option (a) as the more likely explanation. The GOP's criticisms of Clinton's handling of Boko Haram while Secretary of State appear to be politically motivated to weaken her as a potential presidential candidate, rather than based on any superstitions about fashion choices.",

The article mentions that ex-U.S. Rep. Cynthia McKinney was on a boat that entered Gazan waters, violating the Israeli blockade. It's likely that a humanitarian mission would attempt to bring aid to Gaza, despite the blockade.\n\n(b) Human rights group says ship was carrying humanitarian aid to Gaza because the captain of the ship is a skilled cook.\n\nWhile this option also mentions the ship carrying humanitarian aid, the reasoning given - that it's because the captain is a skilled cook - seems irrelevant and unlikely. The cooking skills of the captain would not be a primary reason for a human rights group to state the ship's purpose.\n\nTherefore, option (a) is more likely. The ship's violation of the blockade and the detainment of McKinney suggest a humanitarian mission to Gaza, which a human rights group would plausibly comment on. The captain's cooking ability mentioned in (b) does not logically connect to the human rights group's statement or the ship's likely purpose.",
