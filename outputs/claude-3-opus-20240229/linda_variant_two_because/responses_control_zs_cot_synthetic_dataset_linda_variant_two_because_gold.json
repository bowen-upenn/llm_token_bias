It includes all the information in (a), plus an additional detail about why the other owners are responding.\n\n3) In probabilistic terms, option (b) is a conjunction of two events:\n   - Event A: Restaurant owner says there is \"a big response\" from other owners\n   - Event B: Other owners are impressed with the proactive steps taken to prevent the spread of flu\n\n4) Option (a) is just Event A alone.\n\n5) A basic rule of probability is that the probability of a conjunction P(A and B) is always less than or equal to the probability of its constituents P(A) or P(B).\n\n6) Therefore, the probability of option (a) occurring must be greater than or equal to the probability of option (b) occurring.\n\n7) So, without even considering the specific details of the situation, we can deduce that option (a) is more likely, simply because it involves a single event rather than a conjunction of events.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a): Restaurant owner says there is \"a big response\" from other owners.
