The new information tells us there was a crude device that injured three people in a hospital reception area in Agra, India, home of the Taj Mahal tourist attraction.\n\n2. This suggests some kind of explosive device or bomb injured people at the hospital. The fact that it happened in a major tourist city at a hospital could point to terrorism, but that's speculative based on the limited information given.\n\n3. Option (a) states no motive has been determined yet. This is very likely to be true in the immediate aftermath of such an incident before investigators have had time to gather evidence and explore possible motives.\n\n4. Option (b) also states no motive has been determined yet, but adds the qualifier \"because the investigation is still ongoing.\" While this is likely true as well, it is more specific than option (a).\n\n5. Logically, option (a) is more probable than option (b). Option (b) cannot be true unless option (a) is also true, since (b) includes (a) plus additional information. But (a) can be true even if the second part of (b) is false.\n\nTherefore, option (a) \"No motive has been determined yet\" is more likely to be true based on the information provided. This is an example of the conjunction fallacy, where people tend to think more specific scenarios are more likely than more general ones, even though logically a conjunction of events cannot be more probable than either event on its own.",

The information given tells us that a Thai restaurant in Madrid is taking preventative measures against H1N1 flu, including checking employee temperatures, opening windows for ventilation, and providing sanitizing gel.\n\n2. Option (a) states that the restaurant owner says there is \"a big response\" from other owners. This could mean a positive or negative response, or simply that many other restaurant owners are reacting to the measures.\n\n3. Option (b) is more specific. It states that the \"big response\" from other owners is because they are impressed with the proactive steps taken by this restaurant to prevent the spread of flu.\n\n4. Option (b) is a subset of option (a). All cases of (b) are included in (a), but (a) also includes additional possibilities, such as a negative response from other owners or a response unrelated to being impressed.\n\n5. Probability theory tells us that the probability of a subset cannot exceed the probability of the larger set it is part of. Therefore, the probability of (a) must be greater than or equal to the probability of (b).\n\nSo, the correct answer is (a) Restaurant owner says there is \"a big response\" from other owners. This is more likely than the specific case outlined in (b).",

        "init_model_answer": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n(1) The information given tells us that there have been heavy rains in California, leading to flooding and mudslides in some areas like Kern County.\n\n(2) A winter storm warning being in effect for the Sierra Nevada suggests that more rain or snow is expected in the near future.\n\n(3) When soil becomes saturated from heavy rains, the risk of mudslides increases and can remain elevated for some time even after the rains have stopped.\n\n(4) However, adding the specific reason for the continued mudslide threat (heavy rains saturating the soil) does not make the statement more probable - it's just providing an explanation for the threat. \n\n(5) Occam's Razor suggests that the simplest explanation (mudslides remaining a threat for the next few days) is more likely to be correct than a more complex one (mudslides remaining a threat AND here's the specific reason why).\n\nTherefore, option (a) \"Mudslides will remain a threat for the next few days\" is more likely to be true than option (b).
