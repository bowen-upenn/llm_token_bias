He then expresses amazement at Moscow's alleged heavy espionage in the U.S. currently. \n\nThis suggests that while the U.S. was previously the KGB's top priority, that has changed, and Kalugin is surprised by the apparent high level of Russian espionage now. So logically, (a) follows - that the U.S. is now priority No. 1 again for the KGB, which Kalugin finds remarkable compared to the past.\n\nChoice (b) incorrectly connects his amazement to the U.S. being the No. 1 priority. But Kalugin's surprise stems from the U.S. regaining that status, not amazement causing the U.S. to be No. 1 again. Therefore, (a) is the more likely conclusion based on Kalugin's statements.",
