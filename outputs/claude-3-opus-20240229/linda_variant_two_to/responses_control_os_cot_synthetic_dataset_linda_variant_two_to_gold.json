        "init_model_answer": "To determine which option is more likely, let's approach this step-by-step using probabilistic reasoning:\n\n1) Option (a) states a single event: the funeral company has stringent security patrols in general. Let's call the probability of this event P(A).\n\n2) Option (b) states a conjunction of two events: the funeral company has stringent security patrols AND these patrols are specifically to keep fans from visiting Michael Jackson's grave site. Let's call the probability of the first event P(A), same as in option (a), and the probability of the second event P(B).\n\n3) The probability of two events occurring together, P(A and B), is always less than or equal to the probability of either event occurring alone, P(A) or P(B). Mathematically, P(A and B) \u2264 P(A) and P(A and B) \u2264 P(B).\n\n4) Therefore, the probability of the funeral company having stringent security patrols in general, P(A), is greater than or equal to the probability of the company having stringent security patrols specifically to keep fans from Michael Jackson's grave, P(A and B).\n\n5) Based on this reasoning, option (a) is more likely than option (b).\n\nSo the correct answer is (a) Funeral company has stringent security patrols. The additional specific detail in option (b) makes it less probable than the more general statement in option (a).",

In other words, P(A) \u2265 P(A and B).\n\n4) Therefore, without needing to consider the specific context or details of the situation, we can conclude that option (a) is more likely than option (b).\n\n5) The correct answer is (a) \"We are just all devastated,\" says her father, Mickey Harte.\n\nThis is because the probability of Mickey Harte simply saying this phrase is higher than the probability of him saying it AND saying it to reporters after hearing the news. The conjunction fallacy tricks us into thinking the added detail makes the event more probable, but statistically, adding more conditions always reduces (or at best, leaves unchanged) the probability.",
