The additional detail about tourism in option (b) seems out of place and irrelevant to the topic at hand.",

It is logical that game developers would take advantage of the larger screen sizes to enhance their games. Mentioning specific game titles like Vainglory and Asphalt 8 as examples of games that will benefit from the bigger screens is a reasonable statement.\n\nOption (b) adds an unrelated element (a free coffee coupon) that has no connection to the context of the iPhone release or the games mentioned. This makes option (b) less likely and less coherent compared to option (a).",

This suggests that the funeral company is focused on maintaining privacy and security around the grave.
