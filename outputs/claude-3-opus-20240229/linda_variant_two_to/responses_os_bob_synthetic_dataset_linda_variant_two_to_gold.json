This suggests she has likely become an inspirational figure for pursuing education in general. \n\nOption (b) is more specific in saying she has inspired girls to become doctors or engineers. While it's possible some may be inspired to pursue those particular fields, the passage does not provide evidence she has motivated girls specifically towards medicine or engineering. The more general statement about pursuing education in option (a) aligns better with the idea of her opening doors for others to study where they desire.\n\nSo in the absence of more details, (a) seems the more probable conclusion from the limited information given. The key point is she has likely become a role model for education, without specifying certain career paths.",
