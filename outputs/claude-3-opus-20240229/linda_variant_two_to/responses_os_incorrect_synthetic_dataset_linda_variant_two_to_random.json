While Hillary Clinton affirmed an enduring U.S. commitment to Israel, she also said the U.S. would continue to rebuke Israel when necessary, likely in reference to the controversial building in East Jerusalem that Netanyahu said would continue. Therefore, the passage points to strained U.S.-Israeli ties rather than the two countries celebrating Thanksgiving together.",

        "init_model_answer": "Based on the information provided, option (a) is more likely:\n\n(a) Games taking advantage of screen size will include Vainglory, Asphalt 8\n\nThe passage mentions that the new iPhone 6 and 6 Plus offer bigger screens and new features. It logically follows that some games would take advantage of the increased screen size to enhance the gaming experience. Mentioning specific game titles like Vainglory and Asphalt 8 as examples of such games is a reasonable and likely statement.\n\nIn contrast, option (b) adds an unrelated detail about a free coffee coupon, which does not fit the context of the passage discussing the new iPhones and their features. There is no logical connection between the iPhone screen sizes, games, and a coffee coupon.\n\nTherefore, (a) is the more likely and fitting continuation of the given information.",

It also states that the Forest Lawn Memorial Park employees are not disclosing whether his body is actually there. \n\nGiven the high profile nature of Michael Jackson and the expected public interest in his gravesite, it is more probable that the funeral company would employ stringent security patrols to control access and protect the privacy of the site. \n\nOption (b) mentions eco-friendly practices, which are not directly relevant to the core issue presented in the passage about the celebrity grave and public access to it.
