It states that no injuries were reported among people who had previously visited the dam before the incident.

Option (b) contains all the information from option (a), but adds an additional detail - that Denuta watched the sunset every evening while raising her eight children. This additional detail makes the scenario more specific and less probable.\n\n3. According to the laws of probability, the probability of two events occurring together (a conjunction) is always less than or equal to the probability of either event occurring alone.

The given information about Denny's serving 2 million free breakfasts and the cost of their promotion is not directly relevant to answering the question about IHOP's potential promotion.\n\n2. Option (a) states that IHOP will give away pancakes on February 24. This is a single, standalone event.\n\n3. Option (b) also states that IHOP will give away pancakes on February 24, but adds the additional detail that this giveaway is to celebrate the anniversary of IHOP's founding.\n\n4. Option (b) is a more specific version of option (a). It contains all the information in (a), plus an additional detail.\n\n5. In probability theory, a more general event (like option a) is always more likely or equally likely to occur compared to a more specific event (like option b) that includes additional conditions.\n\n6. Therefore, option (a) \"Competitor IHOP to give away pancakes on February 24\" is more likely than option (b) \"Competitor IHOP to give away pancakes on February 24 to celebrate the anniversary of its founding.\"\n\nThe correct answer is (a) Competitor IHOP to give away pancakes on February 24.\n\nThis is an example of the conjunction fallacy, where people tend to incorrectly believe that a more specific scenario is more likely than a general one.",

There's no clear reason why Nokia would introduce gaming and slider phones specifically to increase visibility at food festivals.\n\n4. The conjunction fallacy reminds us that the probability of two events occurring together (A and B) is always less than or equal to the probability of either event occurring alone (A or B). \n\n5. Therefore, even if statement (a) is unlikely, adding the extra claim in (b) makes it even less likely, since (b) requires both the claim in (a) to be true AND the additional claim about food festivals to be true.\n\nSo, based on the information given and the conjunction rule, the more probable statement is (a) \"Nokia introduced phone gaming and the 'slider' style of handset\".",

        "init_model_answer": "To answer this, let's break it down logically:\n\n(a) states that games like Vainglory and Asphalt 8 will take advantage of the bigger screen sizes on the new iPhones. This makes sense, as larger screens provide more real estate for gaming graphics and controls.\n\n(b) makes the same claim as (a), but adds \"to include a free coffee coupon.\" There's no logical connection between the iPhone's screen size, the mentioned games, and a free coffee coupon. It's an extra, unrelated element.\n\nIn probability, the likelihood of two events occurring together (a conjunction) is always less than or equal to the probability of either event occurring alone. \n\nTherefore, even if we have no idea about the actual probabilities involved, (b) cannot be more likely than (a), because (b) is (a) with an additional condition.\n\nThe correct answer is (a). Games taking advantage of the larger iPhone screen sizes is more probable than those same games also somehow including a free coffee coupon, which seems arbitrary and unrelated.\n\nThis illustrates the conjunction fallacy, where people sometimes incorrectly judge a more specific scenario as more likely than a more general one.",

        "retry": false,
        "use_multi_agents": false,
        "init_model_answer": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The question is asking us to compare the probability of two statements about the funeral company's security practices.\n\n2. Statement (a) says that the funeral company has stringent security patrols. This makes sense given the context that the graves of celebrities like Michael Jackson attract many visitors and fans. Strict security would be needed to control crowds and prevent vandalism.\n\n3. Statement (b) also states that the funeral company has stringent security patrols, but adds an additional claim - that the purpose of the patrols is to promote eco-friendly practices. There's no information given in the prompt to support this additional claim.\n\n4. The conjunction rule in probability theory states that the probability of two events occurring together (A and B) is always less than or equal to the probability of either event occurring alone (A or B). \n\n5. Applying the conjunction rule here, the probability of the funeral company having stringent security patrols and those patrols being for the purpose of promoting eco-friendly practices must be less than or equal to the probability of the company simply having stringent security patrols.\n\nTherefore, statement (a) is more likely to be true based on the information given. The additional claim in statement (b) makes it less probable, even though it's not impossible.",

        "target_answer": "(a) We are just all devastated,\" says her father, Mickey Harte",
        "retry": false,
        "use_multi_agents": false,
        "init_model_answer": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) Option (a) is a straightforward statement that the father, Mickey Harte, said \"We are just all devastated\". This is a natural reaction for a father upon learning of his daughter's tragic death, especially in shocking circumstances on her honeymoon.\n\n2) Option (b) adds additional specific detail - that he said this to a passing waiter while ordering dinner. While it's possible he could have said this to a waiter at some point, the added specificity of it being while ordering dinner makes this scenario less probable. \n\n3) In general, more specific scenarios are less likely than more general ones. The extra details in option (b) make it a subset of the scenarios covered by option (a).\n\n4) Additionally, upon just learning of his daughter's devastating death, it seems unlikely the father would be ordering dinner at that exact moment. His quote expresses a state of devastation, shock and grief.\n\n5) Therefore, by the conjunction rule of probability, option (a) is more likely than option (b). The additional details in (b) make it less probable than the more general statement in (a).\n\nSo in conclusion, option (a) \"We are just all devastated,\" says her father, Mickey Harte - is more likely than option (b). The conjunction fallacy makes option (b) less probable by adding extra specific details.",
