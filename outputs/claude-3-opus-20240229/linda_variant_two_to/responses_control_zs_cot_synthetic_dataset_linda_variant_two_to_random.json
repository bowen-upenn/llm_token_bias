Option (a) is a single event, while option (b) is a conjunction of two events: the event in (a), AND the additional event of doing so to celebrate a traditional American holiday.\n\n3) From probability theory, we know that the probability of a conjunction (A and B) is always less than or equal to the probability of its individual parts (A or B).

        "init_model_answer": "Okay, let's approach this step-by-step using probabilistic reasoning:\n\n(a) The statement \"-Israeli ties\" refers to a single event - the relationship between the U.S. and Israel. Throughout the given context, there are several references to the U.S.-Israel relationship, both positive (Clinton's commitment to Israel) and strained (tensions over East Jerusalem construction). So this single event has a clear basis in the provided information.\n\n(b) The statement \"-Israeli ties to celebrate Thanksgiving together\" is a conjunction of two events: \n1) The U.S.-Israel relationship \n2) The U.S. and Israel celebrating Thanksgiving together\nWhile the first event is well-established in the context, there is no mention at all of the U.S. and Israel celebrating Thanksgiving together. Thanksgiving is a distinctly American holiday, not an Israeli one.\n\nBased on the conjunction rule of probability, the probability of two events occurring together (a conjunction) is always less than or equal to the probability of either event occurring alone.\n\nTherefore, even without the specific details, option (a), which consists of a single event, is inherently more probable than option (b), which is a conjunction of two events.\n\nFurthermore, given that one of the conjoined events in (b) - the U.S. and Israel celebrating Thanksgiving together - has no basis in the provided context, the probability of (b) is even lower, close to zero.\n\nTherefore, I would select option (a) as the more likely statement. The single event in (a) is more probable than the conjunction of events in (b), both in general and especially given the lack of contextual support for the second part of the conjunction in (b).",

This is a single event.\n\n(b) States the same as (a), but adds an additional condition - that the games will include a free coffee coupon. This is a conjunction of two events: the games taking advantage of screen size AND including a free coffee coupon.\n\nFrom probability theory, we know that the probability of a single event is always greater than or equal to the probability of the conjunction of that event with another event.\n\nIn other words: P(A) \u2265 P(A and B)\n\nTherefore, without needing to consider the specific probabilities, we can say that (a) is more likely than (b).\n\nThe additional information about the iPhone release is not relevant to the probability comparison.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (a) Games taking advantage of screen size will include Vainglory, Asphalt 8.",
