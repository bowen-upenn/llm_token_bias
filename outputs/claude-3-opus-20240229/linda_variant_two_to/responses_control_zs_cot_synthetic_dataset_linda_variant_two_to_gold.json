Event B is a conjunction of Event A and an additional event (the children becoming successful, independent adults). Therefore, the probability of Event B occurring is always less than or equal to the probability of Event A occurring alone.\n\nStep 5: Select the more likely event based on the probability rule.

Option (b) is a conjunction of two events: \n   Event 1: The ship set the trans-Atlantic speed record and hosted famous stars.\n   Event 2: The ship will avoid being scrapped by being transformed into a stationary entertainment complex and museum.\n\n3. The probability of two events occurring together (a conjunction) is always less than or equal to the probability of either event occurring alone. Mathematically:\n   P(Event 1 and Event 2) \u2264 P(Event 1) and P(Event 1 and Event 2) \u2264 P(Event 2)\n\n4.

That the construction plans in East Jerusalem have strained U.S.-Israeli ties, AND \n2. That the ongoing disagreements over these construction plans will negatively affect U.S.-Israeli ties going forward.\n\nSince (b) is a conjunction of two events, it is necessarily less likely or at most equally likely to the single event described in (a).\n\nTherefore, by the rules of probability, (a) must be the more likely scenario.\n\nThe additional details about Netanyahu's statements and Hillary Clinton's affirmation of the U.S. commitment to Israel, while providing context, do not change the underlying probability calculation.\n\nSo in summary, I choose option (a) as the more likely outcome based on the information provided and the laws of probability.",

This is a single event.\n\n(b) states that games taking advantage of the screen size will include Vainglory and Asphalt 8, AND that they will feature exclusive gameplay enhancements. This is a conjunction of two events - the games taking advantage of screen size, AND those games having exclusive gameplay enhancements.\n\nAccording to probability theory, the probability of a single event (a) is always greater than or equal to the probability of a conjunction of events (b). \n\nThis is because for (b) to be true, both the event of the games taking advantage of screen size AND the event of those games having exclusive enhancements must occur. Whereas for (a) to be true, only the single event needs to occur.\n\nTherefore, ignoring the narrative details and focusing purely on the probabilistic structure, (a) is inherently more likely than (b).\n\nSo the answer is (a) - Games taking advantage of screen size will include Vainglory, Asphalt 8.",
