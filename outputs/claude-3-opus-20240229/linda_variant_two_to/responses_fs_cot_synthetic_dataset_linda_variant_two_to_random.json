The given information states that the grandmother, Joyce Garrard, faces a capital murder charge for forcing the 9-year-old girl to run as punishment for eating chocolate, which led to the girl's death.\n\n2. Option (a) suggests that a grand jury indicts the girl's stepmother on a felony murder charge. This is plausible because:\n   - The grandmother is already facing charges, so it's possible that the stepmother was also involved in the incident.\n   - A felony murder charge is a serious accusation, which aligns with the severity of the situation that led to the child's death.\n\n3. Option (b) includes the same information as option (a) but adds \"to celebrate the local town festival.\" This additional detail seems irrelevant and unlikely because:\n   - The incident revolves around the girl's tragic death due to punishment, which is unrelated to a town festival.\n   - Indicting someone on a felony murder charge is a serious legal matter and would not be done to celebrate a festival.\n\n4. Comparing the two options, option (a) is more probable because it focuses on the relevant aspects of the case without adding any unlikely or unrelated details.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) A grand jury indicts the girl's stepmother on a felony murder charge.",

The context provided is about a tragic shooting incident where the bodies of a gunman, his wife, and two children were found at their home in Lakeland, Florida. Additionally, a 13-year-old boy was chased down the street and fired at but managed to escape unharmed.\n\n2. Option (a) states that the gunman used a high-powered rifle with a scope, according to the authorities. This piece of information is directly related to the shooting incident and seems to provide additional details about the weapon used by the gunman.\n\n3. Option (b) also mentions the high-powered rifle with a scope but adds an unrelated and seemingly absurd statement about using the rifle to paint a landscape. This addition is out of context and does not fit the serious nature of the incident being described.\n\n4. Considering the grim context of the shooting incident, it is more likely that the authorities would provide factual information about the weapon used rather than making an unrelated and inappropriate comment about painting landscapes.\n\nTherefore, based on the given context and the logical analysis of the two options, the correct answer is (a) The gunman used a high-powered rifle with a scope, according to the authorities.",

This suggests they were likely working in Nigeria, as it would be unusual for such a diverse group to be in Nigeria for tourism or other reasons.\n\n3. Option (a) states that the foreigners worked for a construction firm in northern Nigeria. This is a plausible reason for the diverse group of foreigners to be in Nigeria, as international companies often employ workers from various countries.\n\n4. Option (b) adds to option (a) by suggesting that the foreigners were working for the construction firm to learn how to cook traditional Nigerian dishes. This is highly unlikely, as construction work and learning to cook are typically unrelated activities. Moreover, it's improbable that a group of foreigners from different countries would all be in Nigeria primarily to learn cooking.\n\n5. Therefore, option (a) is far more likely than option (b).

Option (a) provides the additional information that homosexuality was removed from the list of mental disorders in 1975, but despite this, some programs still attempt to treat it.\n\n3.

The question tells us that Botswana recognizes Ouattara as the rightful winner of Ivory Coast's election, and that Botswana's government is concerned the situation threatens peace and security in Africa.\n\n2. We need to determine which of the two options is more likely:\n   (a) The leaders of Botswana also opposed the outcome of Zimbabwe's elections two years ago\n   (b) The leaders of Botswana also opposed the outcome of Zimbabwe's elections two years ago to improve their culinary skills\n\n3. Option (a) suggests that Botswana's leaders have a history of taking stances against election outcomes they perceive as threatening to peace and security in Africa. This is consistent with the information provided about their stance on Ivory Coast's election.\n\n4. Option (b) is essentially the same as option (a), but with the added detail that they opposed Zimbabwe's election outcome \"to improve their culinary skills.\" This added detail seems irrelevant and nonsensical in the context of international politics and security concerns.\n\n5. According to the conjunction rule in probability theory, the probability of two events occurring together (A and B) is always less than or equal to the probability of either event occurring alone (A or B). In this case, option (b) is a conjunction of option (a) and an additional, unlikely event, so it is necessarily less probable than option (a) alone.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) The leaders of Botswana also opposed the outcome of Zimbabwe's elections two years ago.",
