The call to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions by 2100 also implies human-caused emissions are driving temperature increases.\n\nHowever, the details do not specify that the temperature rises are currently reaching critical levels that threaten global food security and severe weather, as stated in option (b). While such outcomes may be possible in the future, the passage focuses more on the report's high confidence that human activities are causing warming in general, making the more concise option (a) the most likely conclusion based strictly on the information given.",

It's common in such cases for the disciplinary measures to include not just awarding the match to the opposing team, but also imposing additional punishments on the team found at fault, such as playing games behind closed doors (without fans present) and monetary fines.

This suggests strong opposition by the Chinese government to the Dalai Lama and Tibetan separatism.\n\nOption (a) aligns with this by indicating Tibetans may have been shot while celebrating the Dalai Lama's birthday, an act the Chinese government likely sees as supporting Tibetan independence. \n\nIn contrast, option (b) seems less likely, as it states the Tibetans were shot while celebrating the birthday specifically to protest the \"'Tibet independence' stance\". Given the Chinese official's comments, it's improbable Tibetans would be protesting against Tibetan independence in this context.\n\nSo based on the information provided, (a) appears to be the more plausible scenario compared to (b).",

By overcoming those challenges, it's likely she has become an inspiring example for other girls in the West Bank to pursue education in general, regardless of the specific field. \n\nWhile some of those girls may be inspired to become doctors or engineers as in option (b), specifying those particular careers makes it a less likely answer.

Option (a) makes a more limited claim that fits the details provided without introducing additional unsubstantiated elements.\n\nSo in comparing the two options solely based on the statements given, (a) is a bit more likely as it requires fewer assumptions.
