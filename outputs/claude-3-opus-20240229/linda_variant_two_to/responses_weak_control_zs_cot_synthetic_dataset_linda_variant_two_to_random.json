Option (b) includes the same information as option (a), but adds \"to include a free coffee coupon\". This additional detail seems unrelated to the games or the iPhone screen sizes. It's an extra, specific claim that doesn't logically follow from the premise.\n\n4. The addition of the unrelated coffee coupon detail in option (b) makes it less likely than option (a). Option (a) is a more general, standalone statement that directly relates to the context provided.\n\nTherefore, by the principle of Occam's razor, the simpler explanation - option (a) - is more likely to be true. Adding the extraneous detail about the coffee coupon in option (b) reduces its probability compared to (a).\n\nSo the answer is (a) - Games taking advantage of screen size will include Vainglory, Asphalt 8.\n\nThis is an example of the conjunction fallacy, where people tend to think more specific scenarios are more probable than general ones, even though probability theory states that the probability of a conjunction of events is always less than or equal to the probability of either event alone.",

The question is asking which of the two options is more likely, given the context about Michael Jackson's grave and the public interest in visiting it.\n\n2. Option (a) states that the funeral company has stringent security patrols. This directly relates to the context, as strict security measures would help control and manage the influx of fans and visitors trying to access Michael Jackson's burial site.\n\n3. Option (b) also mentions stringent security patrols, but adds an additional condition - that these patrols are to promote eco-friendly practices within the cemetery. While eco-friendly practices are commendable, they seem less directly relevant to the immediate concern of managing access to a celebrity's grave.\n\n4. The addition of the eco-friendly element in option (b) makes it a more specific and thus less likely scenario compared to option (a), which is a more general statement that directly addresses the security needs arising from the context.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the principle of the conjunction fallacy, where a more specific scenario is less likely than a more general one, I would conclude that:\n\n(a) Funeral company has stringent security patrols \n\nis more likely than \n\n(b) Funeral company has stringent security patrols to promote eco-friendly practices within the cemetery.",

The question presents two options related to a statement made by Michaela McAreavey's father, Mickey Harte, after her tragic death on her honeymoon in Mauritius.\n\n2. Option (a) simply states the quote from Mickey Harte: \"We are just all devastated.\"\n\n3. Option (b) adds additional context to the quote, suggesting that Mickey Harte said this to a passing waiter while ordering dinner.\n\n4. The additional details in option (b) are not mentioned in the original context provided. It's important to note that this is a Linda Problem, which is designed to test the conjunction fallacy.\n\n5. The conjunction fallacy occurs when people believe that a more specific scenario is more likely than a more general one. In this case, option (b) is more specific than option (a).\n\n6. However, the additional specificity in option (b) does not make it more likely. In fact, the additional details make it less likely, as they are unsupported by the original context.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is (a) \"We are just all devastated,\" says her father, Mickey Harte. Option (a) is more probable than option (b), as it does not include any additional unsupported details.",
