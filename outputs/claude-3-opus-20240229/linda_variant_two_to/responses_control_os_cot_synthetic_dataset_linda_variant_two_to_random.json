Therefore, without even knowing the actual historical details, we can conclude that option (a) is more likely than option (b), simply because (a) is a single event while (b) is a conjunction of two events, one of which seems quite improbable.\n\nSo, the more likely option is (a): The ship set the trans-Atlantic speed record, hosted stars like Grace Kelly, Duke Ellington.",

The background information mentions police detaining suspects, halting gatherings, and violence resulting in deaths and injuries. This suggests there is ongoing unrest or conflict in the Xinjiang region.\n\n2. Option (a) states that ethnic Uyghur residents in Urumqi took to the streets. Given the context of unrest, this option aligns with the background information and seems plausible.\n\n3. Option (b) also states that ethnic Uyghur residents took to the streets, but specifies it was to celebrate a local food festival. While possible, the addition of the food festival reason makes this a more specific scenario, a conjunction of two events (Uyghurs protesting AND it being for a food festival).\n\n4. The rules of probability state that the probability of a single event (option a) is always greater than or equal to the probability of that event occurring in conjunction with another event (option b). \n\n5. Therefore, without any additional information to suggest a food festival is involved, the most probable answer based solely on the given information is (a) Ethnic Uyghur residents in Urumqi, capital of Xinjiang region, take to streets.\n\nThe conjunction of the protest event with the specific reason of a food festival in (b) makes it less probable than (a) which only mentions the protest event.

Remember, the conjunction of two events (A and B) is always less likely or at most equally likely compared to the probability of either event alone (A or B). \n\n5. In this case, the likelihood of games being updated for new screen sizes AND including a specific promotional offer (the free coffee coupon) is less than the likelihood of just the games being updated.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a). It is more likely that games like Vainglory and Asphalt 8 will take advantage of the new iPhone screen sizes than it is for those games to both be updated for the new screens AND include a free coffee coupon.",

We have two options:\n   (a) The funeral company has stringent security patrols\n   (b) The funeral company has stringent security patrols to promote eco-friendly practices within the cemetery\n\n2. Option (a) involves a single event: the funeral company having stringent security patrols.\n\n3. Option (b) involves a conjunction of two events: the funeral company having stringent security patrols AND the purpose of those patrols being to promote eco-friendly practices.\n\n4. According to the rules of probability, the probability of a single event (option a) is always greater than or equal to the probability of a conjunction of events (option b).\n\n5. The background information about celebrities' graves becoming public shrines and people trying to visit Michael Jackson's burial site suggests a reason for stringent security patrols, but it does not provide any information about eco-friendly practices.\n\n6. Without any additional information linking security patrols to eco-friendly practices, we must assume that the conjunction of these two events is less probable than the single event of having security patrols.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is (a) The funeral company has stringent security patrols.",

        "use_multi_agents": false,
        "init_model_answer": "Okay, let's analyze this step-by-step using probabilistic reasoning:\n\n1. Option (a) describes a single event: Mickey Harte saying \"We are just all devastated.\"\n\n2. Option (b) describes a conjunction of two events: Mickey Harte saying \"We are just all devastated\" AND him saying it to a passing waiter while ordering dinner.\n\n3. The probability of a single event (option a) is always greater than or equal to the probability of a conjunction of that event with another event (option b). This is because for the conjunction to be true, both events must occur, which is less likely than just one event occurring.\n\n4. The additional details in option (b) about saying it to a waiter while ordering dinner are irrelevant to the probability comparison. They serve as a distractor that might lead to the conjunction fallacy if we rely on the representativeness heuristic.\n\n5. Therefore, without needing to consider the background information or how representative each option seems, we can conclude that option (a) is more likely, as it involves a single event, whereas option (b) involves a conjunction of events.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (a) \"We are just all devastated,\" says her father, Mickey Harte.",
