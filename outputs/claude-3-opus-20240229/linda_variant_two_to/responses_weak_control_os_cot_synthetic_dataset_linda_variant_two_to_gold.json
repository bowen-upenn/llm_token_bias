This is because residential homes are a subset of all affected structures.\n\n5. If there were no injuries in residential homes, that doesn't necessarily mean there were no injuries in other affected structures like businesses. But if there were no injuries overall, that guarantees there were no injuries in homes.\n\nTherefore, option (a) \"No injuries were reported in the flooding\" is more likely or at least as likely as option (b) \"No injuries were reported in the flooding to residential homes specifically.\"\n\nThe correct answer is (a).",

Option (b) also states that Denuta felt neglected as she raised their eight children, but adds the additional information that the children became successful, independent adults.\n\n4.

The information about Denny's serving 2 million free breakfasts and the cost of their promotion is not directly relevant to answering the question about IHOP's actions. However, it does suggest that giving away free food can be a viable promotional strategy for restaurant chains.\n\n2. IHOP is a direct competitor to Denny's in the breakfast restaurant market. It's plausible that they would respond to Denny's promotion with one of their own.\n\n3. Option (a) states that IHOP will give away pancakes on February 24. This is a simple, straightforward promotion that directly competes with Denny's.\n\n4. Option (b) adds an additional detail - that IHOP's giveaway will be to raise money for charity. This makes the promotion more complex and introduces an additional motivation beyond simply competing with Denny's.\n\n5. Based on the conjunction fallacy, the addition of extra details makes an event less likely, even if those details seem plausible. A simple pancake giveaway is more probable than a pancake giveaway that also raises money for charity, because the latter has more conditions that need to be met.\n\nTherefore, option (a) \"Competitor IHOP to give away pancakes on February 24\" is more likely than option (b) \"Competitor IHOP to give away pancakes on February 24 to raise money for charity\".",

This aligns with the NOAA prediction of an above-average number of major hurricanes.\n\n3) Option (b) makes the more specific claim that the warm temperatures will boost storms to Category 5 intensity (winds 157 mph or greater). While warm ocean temperatures do fuel hurricane intensity, Category 5 is the most extreme level.\n\n4) Probability-wise, it is more likely that the warm temperatures will boost the number of major hurricanes in general (option a), rather than specifically causing Category 5 storms (option b). Category 5 storms are a subset of all major hurricanes.\n\n5) Therefore, option (a) is more probable - the warm temperatures fueling an active season with multiple major hurricanes, as NOAA predicts.

        "init_model_answer": "Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The information given suggests there are some tensions between the U.S. and Israel over construction plans in East Jerusalem. Netanyahu says building will continue, while Clinton says the U.S. will rebuke Israel when necessary over this issue.\n\n2. Option (a) simply states that there are \"U.S.-Israeli ties\". This is clearly true based on the information provided and general knowledge. The U.S. and Israel have a long-standing alliance.\n\n3. Option (b) is more specific. It states that the U.S.-Israeli ties will be negatively affected by the disagreements over construction plans. While the passage suggests these disagreements are causing some strain, it doesn't provide conclusive evidence that the overall ties will be significantly and negatively impacted. Clinton still emphasizes the U.S. commitment to Israel as \"unwavering, enduring and forever\".\n\n4. Comparing the two options, (a) is a more general statement that is clearly supported, while (b) is a more specific and stronger claim that goes beyond what the passage definitively establishes.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, option (a) is more probable than option (b). The passage supports the existence of U.S-Israeli ties, but doesn't provide enough evidence to conclude those ties will be negatively affected in a substantial way by this one issue.",

        "retry": false,
        "use_multi_agents": false,
        "init_model_answer": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. Statement (a) says that games like Vainglory and Asphalt 8 will take advantage of the bigger screen size on the new iPhones. This is a fairly broad and reasonable prediction given that many game developers optimize their games to utilize the latest hardware capabilities.\n\n2. Statement (b) makes the same claim as (a), but adds that these games will feature \"exclusive gameplay enhancements.\" This is a more specific claim than (a).\n\n3. The conjunction fallacy tells us that the probability of two events occurring together (in \"conjunction\") is always less than or equal to the probability of either one occurring alone.\n\n4. In this case, statement (b) is the conjunction of statement (a) and an additional claim (that there will be exclusive gameplay enhancements). \n\n5. Therefore, the probability of (b) being true cannot be greater than the probability of (a) being true. It can only be equal to or less than the probability of (a).\n\n6. Given that (b) is a more specific and restrictive claim, it's likely that the probability of (b) is actually less than (a), not just equal to it.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (a): \"Games taking advantage of screen size will include Vainglory, Asphalt 8.\" This statement is more likely to be true than statement (b).",

        "use_multi_agents": false,
        "init_model_answer": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We know that Michael Jackson was a hugely popular celebrity with many devoted fans.\n\n2. It's stated that celebrities' graves often become public shrines that fans want to visit. \n\n3. The passage suggests there is uncertainty about whether Michael Jackson's body is actually at Forest Lawn Memorial Park. But regardless of whether he is buried there or not, the fact that people think he might be could draw fans to look for his grave there.\n\n4. Given Michael Jackson's fame, it's reasonable to expect that if fans believed he was buried at Forest Lawn, many would try to visit his gravesite specifically.\n\n5. A stringent security patrol in general, while providing tight security, would not necessarily be aimed at keeping fans away from any particular grave.\n\n6. However, implementing stringent security patrols with the specific aim of keeping fans away from Michael Jackson's grave (whether he's actually buried there or not), would be a logical step for the funeral company to take given the expectation of high fan interest.\n\nTherefore, considering the points above, option (b) is more likely - that the funeral company has stringent security patrols in place specifically to keep fans from visiting Michael Jackson's grave site. The key is that the security is aimed at his grave in particular, rather than just being generally stringent.",

This implies the woman has died under potentially suspicious circumstances.\n\n3) A quote is provided, presumably from the woman's father Mickey Harte, saying \"This is too horrible to contemplate\" and \"We are just all devastated\". This is almost certainly in response to the tragic news of his daughter's death.\n\n4) Option (a) provides just the devastating reaction quote from the father. \n\n5) Option (b) provides the same quote, but adds the additional detail that it was said to a group of reporters after hearing the news.\n\n6) Option (b) is a more specific version of option (a). Option (a) is fully contained within option (b).\n\n7) Based on probability, the less specific option (a) is more likely to be true than the more specific option (b). There are more possible scenarios that fit option (a) compared to option (b).\n\nTherefore, using the conjunction rule of probability, the correct answer is (a) \"We are just all devastated,\" says her father, Mickey Harte.\n\nThis is an example of the conjunction fallacy, where people tend to incorrectly think the combined specific conditions are more probable than the single general one.
