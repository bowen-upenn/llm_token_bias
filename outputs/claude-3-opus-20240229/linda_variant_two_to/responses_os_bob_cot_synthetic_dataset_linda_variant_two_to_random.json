Option (b) contains irrelevant information and is grammatically incorrect, making it less likely to be a genuine statement or rumor.\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is (a) Demi's Lovelace role is rumoured to be filled by Chlo\u00eb Sevigny.",

Japan observed a minute of silence for the disaster victims, indicating the severity of the disaster and the loss of life.\n\n3.

There is likely demand for such a vaccine.\n\n3. Cervarix will compete with Merck & Company's Gardasil, another HPV vaccine. This indicates there is an existing market for HPV vaccines that Cervarix will enter.\n\n4. Option (a) states that Cervarix will be available later this year, according to GlaxoSmithKline. This is a reasonable statement given the FDA approval and the likely desire to bring the vaccine to market promptly.\n\n5. Option (b) adds that the release will be timed \"to boost holiday season sales.\" This seems less likely, as the timing of a vaccine release is more likely to be based on regulatory approval and production readiness than seasonal sales considerations. Vaccines are not typically marketed as holiday gifts.\n\nTherefore, option (a) is more likely: Cervarix will be available later this year, according to GlaxoSmithKline. The additional detail about holiday season sales in option (b) seems less plausible given the nature of the product.",

This suggests that providing shelter and livelihood are the primary priorities for the aid groups at the moment.\n\n3.

Option (b) starts with the same definition as (a), but then adds an irrelevant and unlikely qualifier about enjoying ice cream on Sundays.

There is no information in the provided context that connects drone strikes or civilian deaths to weather forecasting.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, option (a) is much more likely to be true than option (b).
