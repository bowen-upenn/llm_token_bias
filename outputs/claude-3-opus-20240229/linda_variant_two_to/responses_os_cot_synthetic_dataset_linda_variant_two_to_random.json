Statement (a) is a single, straightforward claim - that Chlo\u00eb Sevigny is rumored to be filling Demi's role in a Lovelace film. It contains one piece of information.\n\n2. Statement (b) makes the same claim as (a), but adds an additional claim - that Chlo\u00eb Sevigny enjoys skiing as a hobby in her personal life. It contains two pieces of information.\n\n3. Probability theory tells us that the probability of two events both being true (as in statement b) is always less than or equal to the probability of either event alone being true (as in statement a). \n\n4. Unless there is some clear connection or dependency between Chlo\u00eb Sevigny filling this acting role and her enjoying skiing (which seems unlikely), adding the claim about her hobby makes the overall statement less probable, not more.\n\n5. With no other information to go on, the statement making the single claim is more likely to be true than the one making two independent claims.\n\nTherefore, (a) \"Demi's Lovelace role is rumoured to be filled by Chlo\u00eb Sevigny\" is more likely.",

It is a logical next step that the stepmother could also face serious charges, like felony murder, for her potential involvement or failure to intervene in the abusive punishment that led to the girl's death.\n\n3.

Statement (b) says: \"The crisis at a damaged nuclear plant is yet to be resolved to celebrate a local festival.\" This statement doesn't make much sense. Resolving a nuclear plant crisis and celebrating a local festival are two unrelated things. It's unlikely that a festival would be the reason to resolve such a serious crisis.\n\n4. The context also mentions that the quake left many people dead and missing, indicating a very serious disaster. In such dire circumstances, it's much more probable that efforts would be focused on critical issues like resolving a nuclear plant crisis, rather than on celebrating local festivals.\n\nTherefore, based on the context and the logical inconsistency in statement (b), the answer is (a) - \"The crisis at a damaged nuclear plant is yet to be resolved\" is more likely.",

Based on the principle of Occam's razor, which suggests that the simplest explanation is usually the correct one, option (a) is more likely to be true as it does not include any extraneous information.\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is (a): Strategy of proving tea party cred in extreme ways is backfiring, Granderson says.",

The fact that a user was able to grab an address with CEO Steve Ballmer's name is an interesting anecdote, but it doesn't directly relate to the likelihood of Hotmail users being switched over to Outlook.\n\n3.

Wootton Bassett is noted as the town where the bodies of war dead are traditionally brought when they return to the UK. This reinforces that Choudary's proposed march is related to the war.\n\n4. Option (a) states that the British Prime Minister said there would be \"no support\" for the march. Given the controversial and sensitive nature of the proposed march, it's very plausible that the Prime Minister would oppose it.\n\n5. Option (b) adds that the purpose of the march was \"to increase public awareness about recycling.\" This seems highly unlikely and inconsistent with the rest of the information provided. Choudary's accusations and the proposed coffin march are clearly related to the war, not recycling.\n\nTherefore, (a) is much more likely than (b). The Prime Minister opposing the march is far more probable than the march being about recycling, which seems unrelated to all the other details provided.",
