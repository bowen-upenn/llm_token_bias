In probability theory, a general rule is that the probability of a specific event (with more conditions) is always less than or equal to the probability of a more general event. This is because the specific event is a subset of the general event.\n\n4. Applying this rule here, the probability of Denuta feeling neglected while raising eight children who specifically became successful and independent (option b) cannot be greater than the probability of her simply feeling neglected while raising eight children (option a), regardless of how those children turned out.\n\n5. Therefore, option (a) is more likely, or at least as likely, as option (b).\n\nSo, the answer is (a) Denuta, 62, felt neglected as she raised their eight children.\n\nThis is an example of the conjunction fallacy, where people tend to incorrectly think that a more specific scenario is more likely than a general one. But in reality, adding more conditions to a scenario can only make it less likely or at most equally likely, never more likely.",

The conjunction fallacy is a logical fallacy where people misjudge that a specific condition is more probable than a single general one.\n\nGiven:\n- Ambassador Susan Rice says the cease-fire is not holding in Syria.\n- At least 70 people were found dead in Syria on Tuesday, according to an opposition group.\n\nThe two options are:\n(a) A sanctions group deplores sales of arms to Syria\n(b) A sanctions group deplores sales of arms to Syria to support the regime.\n\nStep 1: Identify the general condition and the specific condition.\n- General condition (a): A sanctions group deplores sales of arms to Syria.\n- Specific condition (b): A sanctions group deplores sales of arms to Syria to support the regime.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that the specific condition (b) contains an additional detail compared to the general condition (a).\n- Option (b) specifies that the arms sales are to support the regime, while option (a) does not mention the purpose of the arms sales.\n\nStep 3: Understand that the probability of a general condition is always greater than or equal to the probability of a specific condition.\n- The general condition (a) includes all possible reasons for deploring arms sales to Syria, while the specific condition (b) only includes one reason (to support the regime).\n\nTherefore, option (a) is more likely than option (b). A sanctions group deploring sales of arms to Syria, in general, has a higher probability than a sanctions group deploring sales of arms to Syria specifically to support the regime.",

        "init_model_answer": "Okay, let's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1) The question is asking us to compare the likelihood of two statements about the Kepler telescope's findings.\n\n2) Statement (a) says that Kepler has found 3,538 planet candidates in total. This is a broad statement about all of Kepler's findings.\n\n3) Statement (b) is more specific. It says that Kepler has found 3,538 planet candidates that have at least one potentially habitable planet. This is a subset of the total planet candidates found by Kepler.\n\n4) The question also provides the information that 22% of sun-like stars have possibly habitable planets. \n\n5) Now, let's think about probabilities. The probability of a star having a planet candidate (regardless of habitability) is certainly higher than the probability of a star having a potentially habitable planet candidate. This is because habitable planets are a subset of all planets.\n\n6) Therefore, the number of total planet candidates (statement a) is very likely to be higher than the number of potentially habitable planet candidates (statement b).\n\nSo, based on the given information and logical reasoning, I would say that option (a) \"Kepler has found 3,538 planet candidates to date\" is more likely than option (b) \"Kepler has found 3,538 planet candidates to date to have at least one potentially habitable planet.\"",

Hillary Clinton affirms the U.S.'s unwavering commitment to Israel.\n3. Clinton also says the U.S. will rebuke Israel when necessary.\n4. Construction plans in East Jerusalem have strained U.S.-Israeli ties.\n\nStatement (a) simply mentions \"U.S.-Israeli ties\" without any qualifiers. This is a general statement that doesn't provide specific information about the current state of the relationship.\n\nStatement (b) is more specific, stating that U.S.-Israeli ties are likely to be negatively affected by the disagreements over construction plans. This aligns with the information given, particularly points 1, 3, and 4.\n\nPoint 1 shows that Israel intends to continue the construction, which, according to point 4, has already strained ties. Point 3 suggests that the U.S. is willing to criticize Israel over issues like this, despite the commitment mentioned in point 2.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, statement (b) is more likely: U.S.-Israeli ties are likely to be negatively affected by the ongoing disagreements over construction plans in East Jerusalem.",

This is a stand-alone statement.\n\n2) Option (b) makes the same claim as (a), but adds an additional detail - that these games will feature exclusive gameplay enhancements.\n\n3) Logically, the probability of two events occurring together (a conjunction) is always less than or equal to the probability of either one occurring alone. \n\n4) Therefore, the probability of Vainglory and Asphalt 8 taking advantage of the screen size AND featuring exclusive gameplay enhancements (option b) cannot be greater than the probability of them simply taking advantage of the screen size (option a).\n\n5) Even if it seems plausible or likely that these games would have exclusive enhancements for the new iPhones, adding that extra detail makes the overall statement less probable, not more.\n\nSo in conclusion, I select option (a) as the more likely scenario.

It specifies the reason for the security patrols (to keep fans from Michael Jackson's grave), while (a) just states that there are security patrols.\n\n3) In general, a more general statement is more likely to be true than a more specific one. This is because the specific statement must meet more conditions to be true.\n\n4) For (b) to be true, the funeral company must not only have stringent security patrols, but these patrols must also be specifically to keep fans from Michael Jackson's grave. If the security patrols exist for any other reason, (b) would be false while (a) could still be true.\n\n5) The additional specificity in (b) makes it less likely to be true than (a).
