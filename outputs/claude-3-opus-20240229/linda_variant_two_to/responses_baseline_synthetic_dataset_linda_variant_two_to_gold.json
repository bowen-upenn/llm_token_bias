This relates to the famous conformity experiments by Solomon Asch in the 1950s, which showed the powerful influence of group pressure on individual opinions and perceptions.\n\nGiven these findings, it would be reasonable for the researcher to suggest rethinking the use of committees that decide by unanimous consent. Requiring unanimous agreement could lead to individuals conforming their true perceptions and opinions to match the group consensus.\n\nWhile the brain imaging provides additional neurological evidence for this effect, expertise in brain imaging studies (option b) does not seem as directly relevant to the implications for group decision-making processes. The core insight is about the psychological influence of group opinion on individuals, which was demonstrated in Asch's work even without modern brain imaging techniques.\n\nTherefore, option (a), suggesting to reconsider unanimous consent in committees in light of the conformity effect, appears to be the more likely conclusion drawn by the researcher based on the information provided.",

As journalists they may have been there to report, but that extra detail is more speculative.\n\nSo (a) sticks more closely to the known facts, while (b) inserts an additional unconfirmed reason for their presence. Therefore, (a) seems more likely based solely on what's stated in the question.",

The suggestion is coming from a former head of U.N. peacekeepers in Syria, who would be concerned about reducing violence and protecting civilians.\n\nA no-fly zone is a measure sometimes proposed or implemented in conflict zones to prevent airstrikes by combatants and thereby reduce casualties, especially among civilians. So given the context of many deaths in Syria, it's plausible that a former peacekeeper would suggest this to limit further airstrikes and deaths.\n\nOption (a) is truncated and lacks the reasoning for why a no-fly zone would be proposed.
