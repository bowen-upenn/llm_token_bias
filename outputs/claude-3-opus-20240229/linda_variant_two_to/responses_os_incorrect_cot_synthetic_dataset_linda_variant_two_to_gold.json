Both scenarios (a) and (b) mention that a grand jury indicts the girl's stepmother on a felony murder charge.\n\n3. Scenario (b) adds an additional reason for the indictment: to prevent the stepmother from influencing the grandmother's trial.\n\n4. In a criminal case, a grand jury typically indicts an individual based on the evidence presented and the likelihood that a crime has been committed by the accused. The primary purpose of an indictment is not to prevent the accused from influencing another trial.\n\n5. Without additional information about the stepmother's involvement in the crime or her potential to influence the grandmother's trial, it is more likely that the grand jury would indict the stepmother based on her role in the crime itself.\n\nTherefore, scenario (a) is more likely: A grand jury indicts the girl's stepmother on a felony murder charge, based on the available information.",

Given the severity of the earthquake and the fact that aftershocks are still occurring, it is likely that there is ongoing damage and potential crises.\n\n4.

Statement (b) includes the same information as (a), but adds more details:\n   - Denuta is 62 years old.\n   - She felt neglected while raising their eight children.\n   - The eight children grew up to become successful, independent adults.\n\n3. Comparing the two statements:\n   - Statement (b) is more specific and provides additional information about the outcome of Denuta's efforts in raising her children.\n   - The extra detail in (b) suggests that despite feeling neglected, Denuta's hard work and dedication led to her children becoming successful and independent.\n\n4. Assessing likelihood:\n   - Without additional context, it is more likely for a statement to be true if it is more general, as in statement (a).\n   - The added specificity in statement (b) makes it less likely to be true compared to (a), as it requires more conditions to be met.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the principle that a more general statement is more likely to be true than a more specific one, statement (a) is more likely.",

Option (a) states: \"Richards: Proposal, aimed at thwarting Obamacare, amounts to $483 million tax on women\"\n   - This option mentions a $483 million tax on women but does not provide context for where this figure comes from or how it relates to the cost of over-the-counter birth control.\n\n3.

The zoo claims the giraffe was killed to avoid inbreeding.\n\nNow, let's compare the two statements:\n\n(a) Giraffe's carcass was fed to zoo's carnivores.\n- This statement aligns with the common practice of zoos feeding the carcasses of euthanized animals to carnivores.\n- It is a simple and direct statement that does not require additional assumptions.\n\n(b) Giraffe's carcass was fed to zoo's carnivores to prevent disease transmission among zoo animals.\n- This statement makes an additional assumption about the reason for feeding the carcass to carnivores, which is to prevent disease transmission.\n- While preventing disease transmission is important, it is not explicitly mentioned as a reason in the given information.\n\nBased on the given information and the analysis above, statement (a) is more likely because it does not require any additional assumptions and aligns with common zoo practices.

The new study shows that people's perception of the beauty of images changes based on group opinion. Brain imaging confirms this by showing that perception actually shifts in the brain.\n\n2. Solomon Asch's famous conformity experiment from the 1950s also demonstrated the power of group influence on individual opinions and perceptions.\n\n3. Given the findings of this new study and Asch's classic work, it's clear that group dynamics can significantly impact individual decision-making and even alter perceptions.\n\n4. When committees make decisions by unanimous consent, there is a risk of conformity and group influence overriding individual opinions, as demonstrated by these studies.\n\n5. Therefore, the researcher is likely to recommend rethinking the structure or process of committees that decide by unanimous consent, to mitigate the potential negative effects of group influence.\n\n6. While brain imaging was used in the new study, expertise in brain imaging itself is not directly relevant to the question of how committees should be structured to make decisions. The key takeaway is the power of group influence on individual perceptions and decisions.\n\nBased on this analysis, statement (a) \"Researcher: Rethink committees that decide by unanimous consent\" is more likely than statement (b) \"Researcher: Rethink committees that decide by unanimous consent to include members who have expertise in brain imaging studies\".",

Given the context of the criticism and the suggestion of connecting dots, it's more likely that Whitson would attribute a specific motive (strategic interests) to the U.S. silence, rather than just stating the silence itself.\n\nTherefore, option (b) \"U.S. slammed flogging by its ally, but is silent on routine, grotesque abuses of Saudi citizens to conceal its strategic interests in the region.\" appears more likely to be the correct continuation of Whitson's statement.",

Astronomers used Kepler telescope data to extrapolate the number of planets in the Milky Way.\n2. 22% of sun-like stars have possibly habitable planets, according to research.\n\nNow, let's analyze the two statements:\n\n(a) Kepler has found 3,538 planet candidates to date.\n- This statement suggests that the Kepler telescope has detected 3,538 potential planets so far.\n- It does not specify whether these planets are habitable or not.\n\n(b) Kepler has found 3,538 planet candidates to date to have at least one potentially habitable planet.\n- This statement claims that all 3,538 planet candidates detected by Kepler have at least one potentially habitable planet.\n- However, this contradicts the information given that only 22% of sun-like stars have possibly habitable planets.\n\nBased on the given information, statement (a) is more likely to be true. The Kepler telescope has likely found 3,538 planet candidates in total, but not all of them necessarily have potentially habitable planets. Statement (b) is less likely because it implies that all 3,538 planet candidates have at least one potentially habitable planet, which goes against the 22% statistic provided.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (a) Kepler has found 3,538 planet candidates to date.",

The U.S. has expressed disapproval of Israel's construction plans in East Jerusalem, and these plans have already strained the relationship between the two countries.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, option (b) is more likely: U.S.-Israeli ties are likely to be negatively affected by the ongoing disagreements over construction plans in East Jerusalem.",

The passage states that celebrities' graves often become public shrines for fans and followers.\n\n2. It also mentions that grave hunters believe people will try to visit Michael Jackson's burial site specifically.\n\n3. However, the employees at Forest Lawn Memorial Park (where Michael Jackson may be buried) refuse to confirm whether his body is actually there.\n\n4. Statement (a) says the funeral company has stringent security patrols in general. This aligns with the idea that celebrity graves attract attention and may require extra security measures.\n\n5. Statement (b) goes a step further, claiming that the stringent security patrols are specifically to keep fans from visiting Michael Jackson's grave site.\n\n6. The passage does not provide evidence that the security measures are targeted specifically at Michael Jackson's grave. It only suggests that his grave, like those of other celebrities, may attract fan attention.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, statement (a) is more likely. The passage supports the idea of general stringent security around celebrity graves, but does not specifically confirm that the measures are aimed at protecting Michael Jackson's grave in particular.\n\nSo, is statement (b) more likely than statement (a)? No.",

The context is that a 27-year-old woman was on her honeymoon with her husband, John McAreavey, in Mauritius.\n\n2. Tragically, the woman died during the honeymoon, and Mauritius police have stated that John McAreavey is not a suspect in her death.\n\n3. The woman's father, Mickey Harte, is quoted as saying, \"We are just all devastated.\"\n\nNow, let's compare the two options:\n\n(a) \"We are just all devastated,\" says her father, Mickey Harte.\n- This statement is a simple, standalone quote from the father expressing his grief and shock.\n\n(b) \"We are just all devastated,\" says her father, Mickey Harte to a group of reporters after hearing the news.\n- This statement provides additional context, mentioning that Mickey Harte made this statement to reporters after learning about his daughter's death.\n\nConsidering the tragic nature of the event and the limited information provided, it is more likely that:\n\n(b) \"We are just all devastated,\" says her father, Mickey Harte to a group of reporters after hearing the news.\n\nThe additional context in option (b) seems more plausible, as it is common for family members to be approached by reporters for comments after such a tragic event. The father's statement also implies that he has just heard the devastating news, which adds to the likelihood of this scenario.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, option (b) appears to be the more likely statement.",
