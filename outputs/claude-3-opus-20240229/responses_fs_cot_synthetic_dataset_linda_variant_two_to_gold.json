Option (a) simply states the rumor that Chlo\u00eb Sevigny is said to be taking over that role from Demi. This is a straightforward, plausible casting rumor.\n\n3. Option (b) adds extra details - not only is Chlo\u00eb Sevigny rumored for the Lovelace role, but she will supposedly co-star with Ryan Gosling in her next blockbuster film. \n\n4. Adding the extra details about co-starring with Ryan Gosling in a blockbuster makes option (b) a more specific and complex rumor. Casting rumors are often simpler, without additional details about future unrelated projects.\n\n5. According to Occam's Razor, the simplest explanation is often the most likely. The rumor in option (a) is simpler and requires fewer assumptions than option (b).\n\nTherefore, option (a) \"Demi's Lovelace role is rumoured to be filled by Chlo\u00eb Sevigny\" is more likely to be a typical casting rumor than option (b) with the additional details. The correct answer is (a).",

Specific examples are given, like Gingrich using the \"Washington\" card and Santorum calling Obama a snob regarding education.\n\n3. Granderson's view is that these candidates are pushing \"to the edge of lunacy\" rather than offering substantive reasons to vote for them.\n\n4. The question poses two possible interpretations of Granderson's point:\n   (a) The strategy of appealing to the tea party in extreme ways is backfiring.\n   (b) The strategy is backfiring because it appeals to the far-right but alienates moderate voters.\n\n5. Statement (a) captures the core of Granderson's argument - that the extreme tea party pandering strategy is not working for the GOP candidates.\n\n6. While (b) adds the idea of losing moderate voters, this additional detail is not directly stated in the original context. Granderson's key point is about the strategy backfiring in general.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, (a) is more likely to be the main point Granderson is making: \"Strategy of proving tea party cred in extreme ways is backfiring.\"",

Option (a) states that unusually warm Atlantic surface temperatures are expected to boost storms, without specifying the intensity of these storms. This aligns with the given information about NOAA's prediction of multiple major hurricanes.\n\n4. Option (b) is more specific, stating that the warm temperatures will boost storms to Category 5 intensity. Category 5 is the highest level on the Saffir-Simpson scale, with winds of 157 mph or higher. While it's possible that some storms could reach Category 5, it's less likely that all the predicted major hurricanes will reach this extreme intensity.\n\n5. Given that NOAA's prediction includes a range of major hurricane numbers (three to seven), it's more probable that they expect hurricanes of varying major intensities (Categories 3-5), rather than all of them being Category 5.\n\nTherefore, option (a) \"Unusually warm tropical Atlantic surface temperatures are expected to boost storms\" is more likely, as it aligns better with the given information and the typical distribution of hurricane intensities.",

The question states that Cervarix is a vaccine designed to help prevent cervical cancer, and it has been approved by the FDA.\n\n2. Option (a) states that Cervarix will be available later this year, according to GlaxoSmithKline. This is a logical statement following the FDA approval of the vaccine.\n\n3. Option (b) also states that Cervarix will be available later this year, but it adds \"to help prevent cervical cancer and flu symptoms.\" While the first part of the statement (preventing cervical cancer) is correct, the additional information about preventing flu symptoms is not mentioned in the provided context.\n\n4. The passage does not mention anything about Cervarix being effective against flu symptoms. It specifically states that the vaccine is designed to help prevent cervical cancer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) Cervarix will be available later this year, according to GlaxoSmithKline.",

        "use_multi_agents": false,
        "init_model_answer": "Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1) The given information tells us there was a tragic shooting incident at a home in Lakeland, Florida. The bodies of the gunman, his wife, and two children were found at the scene.\n\n2) Additionally, a 13-year-old boy was chased down the street and fired at by the gunman, but fortunately escaped unharmed. \n\n3) Option (a) provides an additional detail that the gunman used a high-powered rifle with a scope.\n\n4) Option (b) contains the same information as (a), but also adds a speculation that the gunman used this rifle to commit a series of crimes in different locations before the Lakeland incident.\n\n5) The principle of Occam's Razor suggests that when faced with competing hypotheses, we should select the one that makes the fewest assumptions and is the simplest.\n\n6) Option (b) makes an additional assumption about a series of prior crimes, which is not supported by the given information. Option (a) does not make this unsupported assumption.\n\n7) Therefore, based on the given information and the principle of favoring the simplest explanation, option (a) is more likely to be correct.\n\nSo the answer is (a) Gunman used a high-powered rifle with scope, authorities say.",
