        "target_answer": "(a) The album won't chart in any country",
        "retry": false,
        "use_multi_agents": false,
        "init_model_answer": "Okay, let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. John is releasing a new album next year. For an album to chart, it needs to sell a significant number of copies or have a lot of streams.\n\n2. If an artist's album doesn't chart in any country, it suggests that the album isn't very popular or successful commercially. This could be due to various reasons like poor promotion, lack of hit singles, or a decline in the artist's popularity.\n\n3. Selling out major venues for a world tour typically indicates that the artist has a large and dedicated fanbase who are willing to buy tickets to see them perform live.\n\n4. It's unlikely that an artist would be able to sell out major venues worldwide if their latest album was so unsuccessful that it didn't chart in any country. Touring is expensive, and artists usually need the publicity and income generated from a successful album to justify and support a large world tour.\n\n5. Therefore, option (b) is contradictory. If an album doesn't chart anywhere, it's improbable that the same artist could then sell out major venues on a world tour.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the correct answer is (a) The album won't chart in any country. This is more likely than the album not charting but the world tour still selling out major venues.",

        "question": "Suppose Ethan is starring in a new blockbuster movie set to premiere next year. Which is more likely:\n(a) The movie receives critical backlash and fails at the box office.\n(b) The movie receives critical backlash, fails at the box office, but Ethan wins an award for his performance.",
        "target_answer": "(a) The movie receives critical backlash and fails at the box office",
        "retry": false,
        "use_multi_agents": false,
        "init_model_answer": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We know that Ethan is starring in a blockbuster movie. Blockbuster movies are typically high-budget, mainstream films that are expected to be successful at the box office.\n\n2) Option (a) suggests that the movie will receive critical backlash and fail at the box office. While this is certainly possible, it's less likely for a blockbuster movie, as these films are usually designed to have mass appeal.\n\n3) Option (b) includes the scenario in (a), but also adds that despite the movie's failure, Ethan will win an award for his performance.\n\n4) For Ethan to win an award despite the movie's failure is an additional condition that makes option (b) less likely than option (a). It's more common for actors to win awards for movies that are also critically and commercially successful.\n\n5) According to probability theory, the probability of two events occurring together (the movie failing AND Ethan winning an award) is always less than or equal to the probability of either event occurring alone.\n\nTherefore, option (a) is more likely: The movie receives critical backlash and fails at the box office.",

        "question": "Suppose David \"Canelo\" Alvarez is planning to fight again next year. Which is more likely:\n(a) Canelo loses his next fight\n(b) Canelo loses his next fight but wins the rematch with a knockout",
        "target_answer": "(a) Canelo loses his next fight",
        "retry": false,
        "use_multi_agents": false,
        "init_model_answer": "Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. David \"Canelo\" Alvarez is a highly skilled and successful professional boxer. He has a record of 58 wins, 2 losses, and 2 draws, with 39 wins by knockout (as of May 2023).\n\n2. Given his impressive record and skills, it is more likely that Canelo would win his next fight than lose it. However, upsets can happen in boxing.\n\n3. If Canelo were to lose his next fight (option a), it would be a significant event, as he has only lost twice in his career so far.\n\n4. Option (b) is a more specific scenario that includes not only Canelo losing his next fight but also winning a rematch with a knockout. This scenario is more complex and involves more assumptions than option (a).\n\n5. According to the conjunction fallacy, the probability of two events occurring together (in \"conjunction\") is always less than or equal to the probability of either one occurring alone.\n\nTherefore, option (a) \"Canelo loses his next fight\" is more likely than option (b) \"Canelo loses his next fight but wins the rematch with a knockout,\" as (b) involves the conjunction of two events, each with its own probability.\n\nThe correct answer is (a) Canelo loses his next fight.",
