Which is more likely:\n(a) He will become the next celebrated artist in the contemporary art scene.\n(b) He will become the next celebrated artist in the contemporary art scene but his paintings will be more appreciated for their novelty coming from a former president rather than their artistic innovation.",
        "target_answer": "(a) He will become the next celebrated artist in the contemporary art scene",
        "retry": false,
        "use_multi_agents": false,
        "init_model_answer": "The correct answer is (a) He will become the next celebrated artist in the contemporary art scene.\n\nWhile both scenarios are extremely unlikely, (a) is still more probable than (b). Becoming a celebrated artist in the contemporary art world is already incredibly difficult and rare. The additional detail in (b) about Ethan being a former president makes that scenario even more improbable and oddly specific.\n\nIn general, a more concise and simple scenario will tend to be more likely than a more elaborate one with extra unlikely details tacked on. So given these two far-fetched options, (a) is the relatively more likely one, even if the odds of either happening are close to zero.",
