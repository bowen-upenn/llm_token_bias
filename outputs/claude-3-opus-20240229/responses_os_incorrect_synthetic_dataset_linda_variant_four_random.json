The correct answer, perhaps counterintuitively, is (a) The album receives poor reviews and low sales.\n\nTo understand why, let's break this down logically. Option (a) is a single event - the album doing poorly overall. Option (b) is actually a combination of two events - the album receiving poor reviews (like option a), AND one single becoming a big hit. \n\nProbabilistically, for (b) to occur, both of those events need to happen together. The probability of two events both occurring will always be lower than the probability of either event occurring alone. So even if a hit single seems to make the scenario more plausible to us intuitively, (b) is still a subset of the possibilities covered by (a).\n\nPut another way, (a) includes scenarios where the album does poorly across the board, as well as scenarios where it does poorly but has one hit song. Since (b) only includes that latter case, it is less probable than the broader set of outcomes described by (a).\n\nThis question illustrates how our intuitions about probability can sometimes lead us astray. We have a tendency to focus on details that seem to fit and make a scenario more plausible, without considering the underlying logic and math of combined probabilities.
