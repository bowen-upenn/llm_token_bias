This is because the conjunction of two conditions is always less likely or at most equally likely compared to either condition alone.",

The conjunction of two events can never be more probable than either event alone.\n\nThe correct answer is (a) He carries an epinephrine auto-injector.\n\nCarrying an epinephrine auto-injector is a common and important precaution for anyone diagnosed with a severe peanut allergy. However, not all people with peanut allergies necessarily avoid eating at all restaurants. Some may still dine out while taking precautions like alerting the staff, avoiding certain dishes, etc. \n\nSo while many people with peanut allergies likely do both (a) and (b), the probability of (a) alone will always be higher than the probability of (a) and (b) together. It's an example of the conjunction fallacy in probability judgments.",

While the details about the man's depression might make answer (b) seem intuitively more likely, probability theory tells us that the probability of two events both occurring (insomnia and chronic fatigue) must be less than or equal to the probability of either event occurring alone (just insomnia). \n\nAnswer (a) is fully contained within answer (b). So even if chronic fatigue is quite likely for someone with severe depression, (a) must still be the more probable answer, since every possibility covered by (b) is also covered by (a), but not vice versa. The probability of (a) will always be greater than or equal to the probability of (b).",

While the details in option (b) may seem to fit well together, adding extra specificity actually makes the scenario less probable, not more probable.\n\nBeing overweight is a very common factor in Type 2 diabetes. However, not all overweight people with Type 2 diabetes also have high blood pressure. Since option (b) is a subset of option (a), it cannot be more probable.\n\nSo logically, the man being overweight is more likely than him being both overweight and having high blood pressure.

        "init_model_answer": "This is a tricky question that plays on our intuitions, but the correct answer is actually (a) He has hypertension.\n\nThe key insight is that the probability of two things being true (having both hypertension and obesity) is always less than or equal to the probability of just one of those things being true (having hypertension).\n\nMathematically, if we let P(A) be the probability of having hypertension and P(B) be the probability of having obesity, then:\n\nP(A and B) \u2264 P(A)\n\nThis is because for two events to occur together, each event must occur individually. So the probability of the joint event (hypertension and obesity) cannot be greater than the probability of either individual event.\n\nWhile it may seem intuitive that the additional detail of obesity would make option (b) more likely for a patient with Type 2 Diabetes, this is a common logical fallacy. The added condition actually makes the joint probability lower than the single condition alone.\n\nSo in this case, (a) must be more likely than (b).
