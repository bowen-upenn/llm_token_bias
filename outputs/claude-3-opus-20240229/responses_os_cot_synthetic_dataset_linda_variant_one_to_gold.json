He bought a new pair of bigger pants that fit him perfectly. \n\n3. Jordan was happy with the new pants because they were no longer too tight.\n\n4. Since the new pants fit well and made him happy, it's very likely Jordan would continue wearing them in general, including to work and other places.\n\n5. While it's certain he would continue wearing the new pants in general (option a), it's slightly less certain, even if very likely, that he would specifically wear them to work. There's a small possibility he might need to wear something else to work like a uniform or more formal pants.\n\nTherefore, I believe (a) \"Jordan would continue wearing the new pair of pants\" is more likely, since it is a broader statement that is virtually guaranteed to be true given the information. Statement (b) is also very likely to be true, but slightly less certain since there's a small chance he may not be able to wear them to work specifically.\n\nSo in conclusion, the best answer is (a) Jordan would continue wearing the new pair of pants.",

However, there is no information given about the protagonist's relationship with the owner of the car, or their personality.\n\n5. Asking for a ride in someone else's prized possession, especially a classic car, is a fairly bold request. Many people would feel hesitant to do so unless they knew the owner well.\n\n6. The additional detail in option (b) about wanting to show off the car to friends doesn't add much likelihood. Wanting to show off the car would be a potential motivation for asking for a ride, but doesn't make the act of asking more likely in itself.\n\nTherefore, while both options are possible, there isn't enough information to suggest that the protagonist would be so bold as to ask for a ride, with or without the motivation of showing off to friends.\n\nIn the absence of further details, the more conservative assumption is that the protagonist likely would not ask for a ride at all. So I would select option (a) as being more likely, even though neither is strongly supported.",

However, when he looked away, he \"lost his grip\" and the painting fell and was damaged. This could suggest that his fascination was broken in that moment.\n\n3. Option (a) simply states that Brandon would attempt to repair the damaged painting. This seems likely given his intense connection to the painting. Even if the spell was momentarily broken, he would probably still want to restore it.\n\n4. Option (b) adds that Brandon would attempt to repair the painting \"to restore its original beauty\". While this is possible, the description doesn't necessarily suggest that the beauty of the painting was Brandon's primary concern.

While it's possible Jon was able to quit drinking and stay sober without support meetings or counseling, the fact that he had such a serious drinking problem (partying hard every day, to the point of hospitalization) suggests he would likely need ongoing support to make such a major lifestyle change.\n\nSo in weighing the two options:\n\n(a) Attending support meetings or counseling is a likely step Jon would take, but doesn't provide any additional context.\n\n(b) Attending meetings or counseling specifically to help maintain his sobriety aligns with the idea that this support allowed him to successfully quit drinking and live a happier life.\n\nTherefore, I would conclude that (b) is more likely - that Jon would attend support group meetings or seek counseling to help maintain his sobriety and new lifestyle after his traumatic wake-up call.

The destination is Oklahoma, which is described as a place to \"start over\". This indicates Oklahoma is a familiar place, likely somewhere they have lived before or have connections.\n\n4. Given they are fleeing an abusive situation and looking to make a fresh start, it's probable the protagonist would reach out to trusted people in Oklahoma who could provide emotional support and practical assistance in getting settled. Old friends and family would be likely candidates for this.\n\n5. While escape from abuse seems to be the primary motivation, the phrasing in option (b) about \"further escape\" seems to imply the physical relocation itself isn't sufficient as an escape. The protagonist is already putting physical distance between themselves and the abuser by moving to another state.\n\nTherefore, option (a) appears more likely - the protagonist would probably contact friends and family in Oklahoma primarily for general support in starting over, not for additional help in escaping since they've already taken action to leave the situation by moving.\n\nSo in conclusion, I select option (a) as the more probable scenario based on the information provided.",

This shows the captain considers the crew member's refusal to follow orders a serious offense.\n\n3. Option (a) states the captain would likely find another crew member to fix the board. This seems probable, as the captain has already shown he considers fixing the board important and is willing to punish crew members who don't follow his orders.\n\n4.

The brother lives six hours away, which is a considerable distance and may make frequent visits challenging.\n\n4. The protagonist is glad their brother is doing well but wishes they knew him better, suggesting a desire for a closer relationship.\n\n5.

The purchase of a new house is a noteworthy occasion that may prompt the protagonist to make a special effort to visit their brother and celebrate this milestone, despite the distance and their limited contact in recent years. The protagonist's desire to know their brother better also supports the idea that they would seize this opportunity to reconnect.\n\nWhile option (a) is plausible, the specific mention of the brother buying a house suggests that this event could be a catalyst for a visit. Without this detail, the protagonist might be less likely to plan a trip given their historically infrequent visits.\n\nTherefore, I believe option (b) is more likely: The protagonist would likely plan a visit to see their brother to celebrate the purchase of his new house.",

While making new friends is a probable outcome of joining the group to play, the passage does not state this as Derek's explicit motivation.

This shows they care about the quality of their work and put in extra effort.\n\n3. They turned the paper in early. This demonstrates good time management and organization, and suggests they weren't scrambling last minute to complete it.\n\n4. They got a good grade on the paper. While this is a positive outcome, it's not the only thing mentioned. Their love of writing papers is emphasized more.\n\n5. They say \"I can't wait to write another paper for class.\" This directly expresses their eagerness and excitement to write more papers in the future. \n\nConsidering all these points, especially their clearly stated enthusiasm for writing papers in general, option (a) seems more likely. The protagonist's primary motivation appears to be their love of writing papers, not just maintaining high grades.\n\nTherefore, I believe (a) is the more likely answer: The protagonist would start preparing for the next paper assignment, driven by their inherent interest rather than solely focusing on grades.",

We know that Joe is a sheep owner, he heard wolves howling, and he even shot at a wolf when he saw it. This clearly indicates that Joe is actively trying to protect his sheep from the wolves.\n\n3) However, the reason why he's doing this is not explicitly stated. It's reasonable to assume that he wants to prevent his sheep from getting hurt, but this is an inference, not a given fact.\n\n4) In general, when comparing two options where one is a subset of the other (i.e., one option contains all the information of the other plus some additional detail), the more concise option is more likely to be true. This is because each additional detail introduces another opportunity for the statement to be false.\n\n5) Therefore, while both options are plausible given the information, option (a) is more likely to be true simply because it makes fewer assumptions.\n\nIn conclusion, option (a) \"Joe would protect his sheep from the wolves\" is more likely based on the given information.",

Most people who invest time and effort into creating a garden are likely to regularly water and tend to it to ensure its health and beauty. This supports option (a).\n\n3. Attracting butterflies and hummingbirds, while a nice bonus, is a more specific goal that not all gardeners prioritize. It requires additional planning and selection of specific plants. This makes option (b) more restrictive.\n\n4. Option (b) includes option (a) entirely, but adds an additional condition.
