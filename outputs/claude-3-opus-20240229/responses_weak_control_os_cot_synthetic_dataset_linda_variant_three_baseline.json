        "init_model_answer": "Let's approach this step by step:\n\n1) Type 2 diabetes is often associated with being overweight or obese. In fact, obesity is one of the primary risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes.\n\n2) However, not all people with type 2 diabetes also have hypertension (high blood pressure), although there is a significant correlation between the two conditions.\n\n3) The key point here is that the probability of two events occurring together (in this case, the man being overweight and having hypertension) is always less than or equal to the probability of either event occurring alone.\n\n4) This is because for (b) to be true, both conditions need to be met (overweight AND hypertension), whereas for (a) to be true, only one condition needs to be met (overweight).\n\n5) Therefore, even though there's a correlation between type 2 diabetes, being overweight, and hypertension, the probability of the man being overweight (a) is still higher than the probability of him being both overweight and having hypertension (b).\n\nSo, the correct answer is (a) He is also overweight. This question illustrates the conjunction fallacy, where people tend to think that the probability of two events occurring together is higher than the probability of either event occurring alone, which is mathematically impossible.",

        "init_model_answer": "Okay, let's think through this step by step:\n\n1) We know the man has a severe peanut allergy. This means he is at risk of a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) if exposed to peanuts.\n\n2) Carrying an epinephrine auto-injector (like an EpiPen) is a common and recommended precaution for people with severe allergies. It allows them to quickly self-administer epinephrine in case of an allergic reaction, which can be life-saving.\n\n3) Avoiding eating at restaurants is another possible precaution someone with a severe allergy might take, as it reduces the risk of accidental exposure to the allergen. However, not all people with severe allergies avoid restaurants completely.\n\n4) Option (b) is more specific than option (a). It includes carrying an epinephrine auto-injector (from option a) AND avoiding restaurants.\n\n5) Since option (b) is more specific, it is less probable than option (a). Put another way, everyone who does (b) also does (a), but not everyone who does (a) necessarily does (b).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) He carries an epinephrine auto-injector. This is more probable than the combination of carrying an auto-injector and avoiding restaurants.",

        "retry": false,
        "use_multi_agents": false,
        "init_model_answer": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. Aphasia is a language disorder that can affect a person's ability to communicate. It's a common consequence of stroke, particularly when the stroke affects the left side of the brain, which is dominant for language in most people.\n\n2. Hemiplegia is paralysis of one side of the body. It's also a common consequence of stroke, as the stroke can damage the parts of the brain responsible for motor control.\n\n3. While both aphasia and hemiplegia are common consequences of stroke, they don't always occur together. A stroke can cause aphasia without hemiplegia, or hemiplegia without aphasia, depending on the specific location and extent of brain damage.\n\n4. The probability of two independent events occurring together (in this case, aphasia and hemiplegia) is always less than or equal to the probability of either event occurring alone. This is because for two events to occur together, each event must occur individually.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) He experiences Aphasia. \n\nThis is more likely than option (b), which is the conjunction of two events (aphasia and hemiplegia). The probability of the conjunction of two events is always less than or equal to the probability of either event alone.",

Being overweight is a major risk factor for developing Type 2 diabetes. So, it is highly likely that the man is overweight, given his diabetes diagnosis.\n\n3. High blood pressure (hypertension) is another common condition that often co-occurs with Type 2 diabetes and obesity. However, not all individuals with Type 2 diabetes and obesity necessarily have high blood pressure.\n\n4. Option (b) is more specific than option (a), as it includes an additional condition (high blood pressure) alongside being overweight.\n\n5. Probability theory tells us that the probability of the intersection of two events (A and B) is always less than or equal to the probability of either event alone (A or B). In other words, P(A and B) \u2264 P(A) and P(A and B) \u2264 P(B).\n\nTherefore, option (a) \"He is overweight\" is more likely than option (b) \"He is overweight and has high blood pressure.\" The additional condition in option (b) makes it less probable than option (a).",
