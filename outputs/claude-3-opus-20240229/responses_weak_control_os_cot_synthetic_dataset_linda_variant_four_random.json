Option (b) includes two events: \n   - The album won't chart in any country (same as option a)\n   - AND their world tour sells out all the major venues\n\n3.

In this case, option (b) is a more specific and restrictive scenario than option (a). For (b) to be true, not only must the album not chart (as in option a), but they must also have a hugely successful world tour where all major venues sell out. This additional condition makes (b) less likely than (a).\n\n5.

If Lucas De Gaulle returned to French politics today after a long absence, it's quite likely that many of the current issues, political dynamics, technology, media landscape etc. would be unfamiliar to him. The political world can change a lot over time. So option (a) seems fairly probable on its own.\n\n2. Now let's look at option (b). This contains option (a) within it - it starts by stating he would not understand modern issues. But then it adds an additional claim - that despite this lack of modern understanding, he would gain a significant following due to his reputation. \n\n3. Logically, option (b) cannot be more probable than option (a), since it is a subset of option (a). For (b) to occur, (a) must also occur. But (a) could occur without (b) occurring.\n\n4. Additionally, the claim that he would gain a large following despite not understanding current issues is questionable. Some people may follow him for his reputation, but many would likely want a leader who demonstrates understanding of the issues that matter to them today.\n\n5. Therefore, when comparing the two options directly, option (a) is more probable than option (b). Stating he would not understand modern issues on its own is more likely than stating he wouldn't understand but would still gain a large following.\n\nSo in conclusion, I choose option (a) as being more probable - if Lucas De Gaulle returned to French politics today, he would likely struggle to understand many modern political issues.

However, probability theory dictates that the probability of two events both occurring (Gandhi using aggressive language AND inspiring millions) must be less than or equal to the probability of either event occurring alone.\n\n5. Therefore, even if Gandhi hypothetically used uncharacteristically aggressive language in a debate, the probability of that happening alone must be greater than the probability of him doing so and also inspiring millions.\n\nSo in conclusion, I select option (a) as the more likely scenario. Gandhi using aggressive and derogatory language in a debate, while extremely improbable, is still more probable than him doing so and also inspiring millions to follow his philosophy of non-violence.",

So there's a reasonable probability the album could get no nominations.\n\n2) Now let's consider option (b). For this to happen, two things need to occur:\n   - The album receives no Grammy nominations (same as option a)\n   - Despite no Grammy nods, one of the songs becomes a #1 Billboard hit\n\n3) A Billboard #1 hit is a very high bar - it means the song has to be more commercially successful than every other song out at that time.

For event (b) to occur, the podcast must receive mediocre reviews (event a) in addition to gaining millions of subscribers.\n\n3) Probability theory tells us that the probability of two events occurring together (an \"AND\" event) is always less than or equal to the probability of either of the individual events occurring alone.\n\n4) Therefore, the probability of the podcast receiving mediocre reviews AND gaining millions of subscribers (event b) must be less than or equal to the probability of the podcast simply receiving mediocre reviews (event a).\n\n5) It's worth noting that gaining millions of subscribers is a fairly rare event, especially for a new podcast. This makes event (b) even less likely.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is (a) The podcast receives mediocre reviews. This is more likely than the podcast receiving mediocre reviews and also gaining millions of subscribers.",

Recognize the conjunction: Option (b) is a conjunction of two events - the movie winning no awards AND becoming a box office hit. Option (a) is a single event - the movie winning no awards.\n\n2. Understand the conjunction rule: The probability of a conjunction of events (A and B) is always less than or equal to the probability of either of its constituent events (A or B). In other words, P(A and B) \u2264 P(A) and P(A and B) \u2264 P(B).\n\n3. Apply the rule to the question: The probability of the movie winning no awards and becoming a box office hit [option (b)] is always less than or equal to the probability of the movie winning no awards [option (a)].\n\n4. Conclude: Therefore, option (a) \"The movie wins no awards\" is more likely or probable than option (b) \"The movie wins no awards but becomes a box office hit.\"\n\nThe addition of extra conditions or events in option (b) makes it less likely than option (a), even though our intuition might suggest that the star power of Lucas and Ethan could make a box office hit more likely.

Receiving a standing ovation at the United Nations is a significant event, but it's not unheard of. If Alexei Krushchev delivers a particularly moving or impactful speech, it's conceivable that all present might stand and applaud.\n\n2) Now, let's look at option (b). This scenario includes all of option (a), but adds an additional, highly specific event: Krushchev dramatically removing his shoe and banging it on the table. This is a reference to an infamous incident in 1960 when Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev allegedly banged his shoe on his desk at the UN in protest.\n\n3) The conjunction rule in probability theory states that the probability of two events occurring together (in \"conjunction\") is always less than or equal to the probability of either one occurring alone. In other words, adding more specificity to a scenario generally makes it less likely, not more.\n\n4) Therefore, while the shoe-banging incident is memorable, the probability of it being precisely replicated in conjunction with a standing ovation is less than the probability of a standing ovation alone.\n\n5) Thus, by the conjunction rule, option (a) is more likely than option (b).\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is (a): It is more likely that Alexei Krushchev will receive a standing ovation from all present, than that he will receive a standing ovation and also bang his shoe on the table.",

Amir Khomeini is likely an Iranian name, and the surname suggests a potential relation to Ayatollah Khomeini, the former Supreme Leader of Iran, known for his conservative Islamic views and criticism of Western influence.\n\n2. Given this context, a book on political philosophy by someone with this name is more likely to present views that are at odds with mainstream Western political thought.\n\n3. For the book to become a bestseller in the USA, it would need to appeal to a wide audience of American readers. However, if the book espouses views that are heavily critical of Western ideas, it may have more limited appeal in the US market.\n\n4. On the other hand, if the book does become a bestseller in the USA, it is quite likely that it would also face heavy criticism from Western scholars who disagree with its philosophical arguments or political positions.\n\n5. However, option (b) is a conjunction of two events: (i) the book becoming a bestseller in the USA, and (ii) the book being heavily criticized by Western scholars.

China currently has a mixed economy with a significant level of state control and intervention, especially in key strategic industries. A completely free-market system would be a drastic change from the status quo.\n\n2. China's government has consistently emphasized the importance of maintaining a \"socialist market economy\" model with a strong role for state-owned enterprises in pillar industries. They view this as important for economic stability and national security.\n\n3. Major economic policy shifts in China tend to be gradual rather than sudden, to maintain stability. A complete shift to free markets would be highly uncharacteristic.\n\n4. Option (b) is a subset of option (a). For (b) to occur, (a) must also occur. However, (a) could occur without (b) - China could theoretically implement free markets without maintaining state control of key industries.\n\n5. Therefore, even if both scenarios are unlikely, probability theory states that the probability of (a) must be greater than or equal to the probability of (b).
