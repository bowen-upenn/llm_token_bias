The given information tells us about a veteran PBS journalist who has moderated many debates, written a book on presidential debates, and has a large family.

Option (a) states that the journalist admitted to \"dropping the ball\" (i.e. making a mistake or not following up properly) when Clinton talked about Monica Lewinsky. Given the journalist's extensive experience, this is plausible - even seasoned pros can make mistakes or have lapses in judgment.\n\n3. Option (b) adds to (a) by suggesting the journalist intentionally dropped the ball in order to steer the conversation back to campaign issues. While this is possible, it seems less likely. An experienced journalist would probably try to maintain control of the debate and pursue relevant follow-ups rather than intentionally letting something slide.\n\n4. The principle of Occam's Razor suggests that when choosing between competing hypotheses, we should prefer the one that makes the fewest assumptions. Option (b) assumes an additional intentional motive that isn't necessary to explain the situation.\n\n5. Therefore, option (a) is more likely - the journalist simply made a mistake or error in judgment, as even experienced professionals sometimes do. We don't need to assume it was an intentional choice to steer the conversation a certain way.\n\nSo in conclusion, (a) is the more likely scenario based on the information provided and the principle of making the fewest assumptions necessary to explain the situation.",

Even though answer (b) seems more plausible and fits the narrative, it cannot be more probable than (a) alone.\n\nLet's break it down:\n1) Answer (a) is a simple statement about the finance minister delivering the 2009 budget on Thursday. This is a straightforward, singular event.\n\n2) Answer (b) contains all the information in (a), but adds additional details - that the finance minister will address the economic downturn and propose solutions in his budget speech.\n\n3) Probability theory tells us that the probability of two events occurring together (a conjunction) is always less than or equal to the probability of either event occurring alone. In other words, P(A and B) \u2264 P(A) and P(A and B) \u2264 P(B).\n\n4) Therefore, the probability of the finance minister delivering the budget speech AND addressing the downturn/proposing solutions (b) must be less than or equal to the probability of him simply delivering the budget speech (a).\n\n5) Our minds tend to prefer the more detailed, coherent narrative in (b). But logically, the additional specifics make it less likely, not more.\n\nSo in conclusion, the correct answer must be (a) - the finance minister is expected to deliver the 2009 budget statement on Thursday, regardless of what he says in the speech.",

Option (a) states that the success of state sites varied, but they seemingly did better than the federal site. This aligns with the information about the federal site's technical issues.\n\n5. Option (b) contains the same information as (a), but adds \"so that fewer people reported issues while enrolling through them than through HealthCare.gov.\" While this may be a reasonable inference, it is not directly stated in the given information.\n\nTherefore, option (a) sticks more closely to the provided facts, while (b) includes an additional assumption. Based on the principle of selecting the option that is more likely given only the stated information, the correct answer is (a) State sites' success varied but seemingly did better than the federal site.",

The fact that Michelle Obama announced the best picture Oscar winner is an unusual event, as it's not common for the First Lady to be involved in such award shows.

Option (a) makes a general statement about the intersection of politics and Hollywood during this awards season, implying that Michelle Obama's appearance was just one instance of this trend. This seems plausible, as celebrities and politicians often interact for various reasons, such as to raise awareness for certain causes or to show support for certain groups.\n\n3. Option (b) suggests a specific reason for Michelle Obama's appearance - to emphasize the importance of arts education. While this is possible, it seems less likely than option (a) for a few reasons:\n   - The Best Picture category is not directly related to education, so it would be an odd choice if her main goal was to promote arts education.\n   - Announcing the winner of a high-profile award is a significant moment that would likely overshadow any message about arts education.\n   - Option (b) is oddly specific compared to option (a), which makes it feel less probable given the limited information provided.\n\n4.

While this motive is plausible given the target was a minority religious group, the passage does not provide any evidence to support this specific motive.\n\n4. Applying Occam's Razor, the simplest explanation that fits the facts is usually the most likely. Option (a) does not make any additional unsupported claims, while (b) does.\n\nTherefore, (a) is more likely to be true based solely on the information provided.

However, this option implies a deliberate misrepresentation of facts by the agency to justify reducing staff.\n\n4.

Additionally, the phrasing \"believed to be the largest in agency history\" suggests that the reason for the firing is substantial and unprecedented, further supporting the likelihood of a genuine security issue.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and logical reasoning, the correct answer is (a) Agency said bags not properly screened.",
