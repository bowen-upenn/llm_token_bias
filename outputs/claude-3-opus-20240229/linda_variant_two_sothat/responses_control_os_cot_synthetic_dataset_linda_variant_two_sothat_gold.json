Option (a) is a single event, while option (b) is a conjunction of two events: the White House raising an objection (event A) and emphasizing the U.S. commitment to freedom of navigation (event B).\n\n3. According to the basic rule of probability, the probability of a conjunction P(A and B) is always less than or equal to the probability of its individual constituents, P(A) or P(B).\n\n4.

The additional information about the Chinese fighter jet's aggressive behavior and the dangerous passes at the U.S. Navy patrol plane, while providing context, does not change the fundamental probability rule.\n\nSo, based on probabilistic reasoning and ignoring the representativeness heuristic, the correct answer is (a) The White House said the incident was a provocation and raised an objection with Beijing, as it is more likely than the conjunction presented in option (b).",

We have two options to consider:\n   (a) North Korea continues to criticize U.S. foreign policies in its state media.\n   (b) North Korea criticizes U.S. foreign policies in its state media and there is a significant diplomatic breakdown between the two countries.\n\n2. Option (a) involves a single event: North Korea continuing its criticism of U.S. policies in state media. This is a common occurrence that has happened many times before.\n\n3. Option (b) is a conjunction of two events: \n   i. North Korea criticizing U.S. policies in state media (same as option a)\n   ii. A significant diplomatic breakdown between North Korea and the U.S.\n\n4. According to probability theory, the probability of a single event (option a) is always greater than or equal to the probability of that event AND another event both occurring (option b).\n\n5. While the criticism from North Korea could potentially lead to diplomatic issues, a significant breakdown is not guaranteed to follow from just media criticism alone. Additional events would likely need to occur for a major diplomatic incident to unfold.\n\nTherefore, without any additional information to suggest otherwise, option (a) is more likely than option (b). The single event of North Korea continuing its established pattern of criticizing U.S. policies in its media is more probable than that event AND a significant diplomatic breakdown occurring.",

The conjunction fallacy occurs when we mistakenly judge (b) as more probable because the additional detail makes for a more coherent narrative, despite violating the laws of probability.",
