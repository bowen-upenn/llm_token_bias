The incident involved a Chinese fighter jet making \"dangerous\" passes at a U.S. Navy patrol plane, coming as close as 20 feet. This suggests a serious and provocative encounter.\n\n2. Given the seriousness of the incident, it's likely that the White House would respond by raising an objection with Beijing. Both options (a) and (b) include this element.\n\n3. However, option (b) goes a step further by suggesting a reason for the White House's objection - to emphasize the U.S. commitment to freedom of navigation in the region.\n\n4. The South China Sea is a contentious area where the U.S. has consistently asserted its right to freedom of navigation, despite China's claims to the contrary. \n\n5. By raising an objection in this context, the White House would likely want to reinforce this long-standing U.S. position and send a signal to China.\n\nTherefore, option (b) seems more likely. The White House would probably not just raise an objection, but also use the opportunity to underscore the U.S. stance on a key issue in the U.S.-China relationship and the region's geopolitics.",

This suggests North Korea is being critical of U.S. foreign policy and leadership.\n\n2. It also notes that this rhetoric raises comparisons to previous comments the North Korean regime has made about the West. This implies such criticisms from North Korea are not uncommon or unprecedented.\n\n3. Looking at the two options:\n\n(a) Suggests that North Korea will continue its pattern of criticizing U.S. foreign policies in state media, which aligns with the information given. \n\n(b) Goes a step further, suggesting that in addition to the media criticism, there will also be a significant diplomatic breakdown between the two countries.\n\n4. While tensions often run high between the U.S. and North Korea, a significant diplomatic breakdown is a more severe and specific outcome compared to ongoing media criticism.\n\n5. The question stem does not provide any information to suggest a severe diplomatic breakdown is imminent, beyond the typical heated rhetoric. \n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, option (a) seems more likely - that North Korea will continue its pattern of criticizing U.S. policies in state media, without necessarily leading to a major diplomatic incident. The added specificity and severity of option (b) is not strongly supported by the question stem.",

The U.S. State Department is mentioned, implying there is some international concern or attention on this group.\n\n4.

However, the information given does not explicitly state that Boko Haram is seeking to extend operations beyond their current area. \n\nTherefore, while it's plausible that Boko Haram may seek or have ties to al Qaeda to enhance their capabilities, there is not enough information to assume they are doing so specifically to extend operations beyond their current area.\n\nGiven this, I would say (a) is more likely based on the information provided - that the group likely has ties to al Qaeda, but we cannot say for certain it is to extend their operations based on what is stated.",

Option (a) stops at this statement, providing no additional information.\n\n3.

The additional information in option (b) is a reasonable extension of the initial statement. It does not introduce any new or unrelated claims.\n\n5. When comparing two options, if one is strictly more informative than the other while remaining equally plausible, it is generally more likely to be true.\n\nTherefore, option (b) is more likely to be true as it provides more specific and detailed information that logically follows from the shared initial statement, without introducing any implausible or unrelated claims.",

In general, the more specific a statement is, the less likely it is to be true compared to a more general statement.

The additional information in (b) is not necessary to answer the question about the likelihood of evacuation orders. It doesn't make the evacuation orders themselves any more or less likely.\n\n5. When comparing two options, if one option has strictly more information than the other without affecting the probability, it is less likely to be true.

The first sentence tells us that conservatives on the Texas board are voting to make changes to the curriculum to \"balance\" it. This suggests they want to add more conservative perspectives.\n\n2. The second sentence informs us that Texas textbook requirements often influence those in other states. So changes in Texas can have a broader national impact.\n\n3. Option (a) states that the textbooks will likely be adopted in other conservative states. This logically follows from the first two sentences - if conservative board members in Texas are pushing for curriculum changes, it's reasonable to expect conservative leaders in other states would favor adopting those changes.\n\n4. Option (b) repeats the prediction of adoption in conservative states from (a), but adds a clause saying this will result in Texas history textbooks including a broader range of perspectives. However, the passage suggests the conservative board members are aiming to \"balance\" the curriculum according to their views, not necessarily to expand it to a wider range of perspectives.\n\n5. Therefore, based on the information given, option (a) is more likely. The passage supports the idea that conservative-led changes in Texas will carry over to other conservative states, but does not provide evidence that this will lead to a broader range of perspectives in Texas history textbooks.\n\nSo in conclusion, (a) is the more likely outcome based on the statements provided.",
