The U.S. has a long-standing policy of supporting freedom of navigation in international waters, including the South China Sea. \n\n2. Raising an objection to China's actions provides an opportunity for the U.S. to reiterate this policy stance.\n\n3. Option (b) provides more context and rationale for the White House's response compared to option (a), making it a more complete and plausible statement.\n\nSo while both options indicate the White House viewed the incident as a provocation and lodged an objection, the additional detail in (b) about using it to emphasize the U.S. position on freedom of navigation makes it the more likely full White House response in my view.",

This suggests a trend of modern, stylish hotel decor in Spain.\n\nOption (a) aligns with this by stating that Analina Rooms in Madrid has modernist interiors, without making any additional claims. \n\nOption (b) adds the speculative assertion that the hotel's decor is meant to complement the aesthetic of the urban environment.
