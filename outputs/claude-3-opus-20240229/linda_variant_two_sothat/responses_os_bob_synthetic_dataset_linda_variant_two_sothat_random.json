This type of incident could raise diplomatic tensions.\n2) Expressing the incident as a \"provocation\" and lodging an objection directly with Beijing is a logical and measured response from the White House to this type of incident.\n3) Option (b) adds an unusual and unlikely detail about raising the objection so that residents near airstrips would hear about it. There's no clear reason the White House response would be tailored to people living near airfields.\n\nSo in summary, (a) sounds like a realistic response from the U.S. government to this type of incident, while (b) adds an implausible detail that makes it the less likely option. The White House would likely object through diplomatic channels, not aim their objections at residents living near airstrips.",
