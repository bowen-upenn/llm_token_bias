Beyond just calling it a provocation and objecting to Beijing, the U.S. would probably want to use this incident to reiterate its stance on freedom of navigation in the contested waters of the South China Sea, which has been a point of tension between the U.S. and China. Framing the objection in this context sends a broader geopolitical message.",

Probability theory tells us that the probability of a more specific event (a AND b) cannot exceed the probability of a more general event that encompasses it (a).\n\nGiven two events A and B, the probability of A and B both occurring (the conjunction) will always be less than or equal to the probability of either A or B occurring alone.
