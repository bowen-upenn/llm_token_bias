The White House condemning the incident as a provocation and raising objections with Beijing would not only be a response to the specific incident but also an opportunity for the U.S. to reiterate its stance on the importance of maintaining freedom of navigation in the South China Sea. This aligns with the U.S.'s long-standing position on the issue and its efforts to counter China's increasing assertiveness in the region.",

Stating the hostage release as a direct outcome of meeting the demands, as option (b) does, aligns with how these situations usually unfold.\n\nIn contrast, option (a) mentions the prisoner release demand but does not explicitly connect it to freeing the Austrian hostages. While still plausible, the phrasing makes it a bit less likely than option (b) in my view, given the context provided.\n\nHowever, without additional details, it's impossible to say with certainty. More context around the motivations and communications from the kidnappers would be needed to make a fully informed determination. But based just on what's presented here, I'd select (b) as the more probable scenario.",

It does not provide any additional details about the third suspect being captured due to his injuries. Without that specific information being stated, inferring that the third suspect was injured to the point of being unable to escape and getting arrested is making an assumption beyond what the question tells us.\n\nSo sticking closely to the facts provided, (a) is the more probable answer, as it does not include the extra unconfirmed details about the third suspect's capture that (b) does.

Option (a) just states the location without tying it to the lack of damage.\n\nSince the authorities lifted the tsunami warning and witnesses reported only minor shaking, it suggests the quake epicenter was a good distance away from land. So mentioning that distance as an explanation for the limited impact, as done in (b), makes that the more complete and likely answer in my view.
