The fact that a wall was built to keep people in Mexico out, including Tom, implies he would probably want to return to the US if possible. \n\nHowever, there are no specific details given about Tom having a former job or hometown routine in the US that he would be aiming to resume. The passage focuses more on his social connections in the US rather than a specific lifestyle there. So while it's quite likely he would reach out to his American friends for help returning to the US in general, there isn't enough information to assume he had a particular job and hometown life that he would be trying to get back to.",

This suggests a willingness on the family's part to ultimately accept the protagonist's differing beliefs, even if it took some time. \n\nGiven that the family was able to reach this point of acceptance, it seems likely the protagonist would be open to having respectful discussions to foster greater mutual understanding, rather than just stating their position without that goal of increasing empathy between them. The family's initial harsh reaction but eventual coming to terms also points to them being open to dialogue to better understand their child's perspective, even if they don't agree with it.\n\nSo while both (a) and (b) involve open discussions, the added detail in (b) about the discussions serving the purpose of understanding each other better seems to fit the overall arc of the family ultimately accepting the protagonist's beliefs after a difficult initial period. The passage suggests a family dynamic where difficult conversations can eventually lead to greater acceptance and desire to relate to each other despite major differences.",

Teaching a dog new tricks while playing fetch is possible, but more specific and less likely than just the general act of playing fetch.",

It's natural to want to share photos of such a noteworthy event. However, there is no evidence in the passage to suggest that Casey's primary motivation for sharing the photos would be to brag about the experience to their friends. While this could be a possibility, it's not explicitly supported by the given information. Therefore, option (a) is more likely, as it simply states that Casey would share the photos without making assumptions about their underlying intentions.",

Given the length of the punishment, it seems more probable that Cara would not only apologize for her actions, but also hope that the apology might lead her parents to reconsider and possibly shorten the grounding period.
