This suggests he didn't have a lot of time to carefully select his outfit.\n\n2. He threw on clothes straight from the dryer, which turned out to still be wet. This indicates he was in a major rush and didn't even have time to check if the clothes were fully dry. \n\n3. When he got to the interview, he realized his pants were uncomfortable because they were still damp. He was likely distracted by this discomfort during the interview.\n\n4. The question states it must have been obvious he was uncomfortable, implying his discomfort was visible to the interviewer. This likely reflected poorly on him.\n\n5. Harry ended up not getting the job, suggesting his performance in the interview was negatively impacted.\n\nGiven these details, option (a) seems less likely. If Harry was very conscious of making a good impression, he probably would have ensured he was wearing dry, presentable clothes, even if he was running late. He wouldn't have settled for rushing out the door in damp pants.\n\nOption (b) aligns better with the story. Harry was rushing to make the interview on time and as a result, didn't notice his pants were still wet. Despite being conscious of making a good impression, his lack of time resulted in him going to the interview in an uncomfortable state, which ended up being detrimental.\n\nTherefore, after analyzing the situation, I believe (b) is the more likely scenario based on the information provided.",

The passage tells us that Nina needed to get to a company meeting and her initial plan of getting a ride from a friend didn't work out.\n\n2. She decided to take the subway instead, despite being nervous about it since she had never taken the subway before.\n\n3. During the commute, she realized that taking the subway wasn't difficult at all.\n\n4. Option (a) states that based on this experience, Nina would likely use the subway for her future commutes. This is a reasonable conclusion given her positive experience.\n\n5. Option (b) also states that Nina would likely use the subway for future commutes, but provides additional reasoning: she found it more efficient and less stressful than she had expected.\n\n6. The passage doesn't explicitly state that Nina found the subway more efficient or less stressful. However, we can infer this from the fact that she realized taking the subway \"wasn't difficult at all\".\n\n7. While both options suggest the same future behavior for Nina, option (b) provides additional context that, while not explicitly stated, can be reasonably inferred from the passage.\n\nTherefore, I would choose option (b). Nina would likely use the subway for her future commutes because she found it more efficient and less stressful than she had expected.",

The key difference is that option (b) provides additional context about why they would celebrate together.\n\n2. From the given information, we know that Sam and Alexis are best friends who both love soccer. When Alexis didn't make the team the first time, Sam helped Alexis prepare for the next try outs, demonstrating their strong friendship and support for each other.\n\n3. It is natural to assume that best friends who share a passion for soccer and have supported each other through challenges would celebrate together when they both achieve their goal of making the team.\n\n4. While option (a) simply states that they would celebrate together, option (b) provides a reasonable explanation for why they would do so - they were determined to enjoy their shared success together. This additional context aligns with the information given about their friendship and mutual support.\n\n5. However, option (b) introduces information that is not explicitly stated in the original text. We don't know for certain if they were \"determined\" to enjoy their success together, even if it seems likely given their close friendship.\n\n6.

The fact that the board broke during one of his tricks was an unfortunate accident.\n\n4.

We don't know for certain if Reese's motivation for buying a new skateboard would be specifically because he doesn't want to give up due to one accident.\n\nTherefore, option (a) is more likely, as it follows directly from the information given in the scenario without making additional assumptions. Reese's passion for skateboarding suggests he would likely buy a new skateboard, but we cannot say for certain what his exact reasoning would be.",

Ginette viewed this action as a sign of progress, suggesting she appreciated the effort, even if it wasn't exactly what she had in mind.\n\nGiven these points, it's more likely that (b) is the correct answer. Here's why:\n\n- The additional context provided in option (b) aligns with the information given in the question. Ginette took the head pat as a sign of progress, implying that she saw it as a starting point for her husband to show more affection.\n- Option (a) is less specific and doesn't capture the nuance of Ginette's reaction. While she would likely encourage her husband to continue showing affection, option (b) provides a more complete explanation of her perspective.\n\nTherefore, the more probable answer is (b) Ginette would likely encourage her husband to continue showing affection in small ways because she felt that the pet on the head was a good starting point and hoped for further improvements.",

The older kids were young criminals and Jeremy thought it was cool. He began committing crimes that landed him in and out of Juvie. He's now 35 years old in jail and categorized as a career criminal.\nWhich is more likely?\n(a) Jeremy would likely commit another crime.\n(b) Jeremy would likely commit another crime because he still holds the same beliefs and attitudes that initially led him to commit crimes.",

Being exposed to and influenced by older criminal kids at age 10 seems to have set him on this path.\n\n2. The fact that Jeremy is now 35 and categorized as a \"career criminal\" suggests that criminal behavior has become a persistent pattern throughout his life. He has likely been committing crimes regularly to earn this label.\n\n3. At 35, Jeremy is still in jail, indicating his criminal behavior has continued into adulthood. There's no information provided to suggest he has reformed or that his underlying beliefs and attitudes about crime have changed.\n\n4. Option (b) provides additional context - that Jeremy likely still holds the same beliefs and attitudes that originally led him to crime. If those root causes haven't been addressed, he would be at high risk of reoffending.\n\n5. However, option (b), by providing this extra detail, is a more specific case of option (a). Option (a) is more general and encompasses (b).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) Jeremy would likely commit another crime. While (b) provides a plausible reason why he would reoffend, it is a more specific case of the more general statement in (a). Logically, the probability of (a) must be at least as high as (b), if not higher.",

Yannick sent daily emails to his friends to update them about his visit to New York City. This indicates he enjoyed keeping his friends informed about his trip.\n\n3. The fact that Yannick sent \"many beautiful pictures\" from the Empire State Building could imply he enjoys photography. However, this isn't explicitly stated in the given information.\n\n4.
