This implies he did not take steps to address the issue of the wet pants before the interview, even though he was likely aware it could make a poor impression. \n\nOption (b) provides additional context that aligns with Harry being conscious of needing to make a good impression, which makes his failure to dry the pants or change more notable and impactful to the outcome. In contrast, option (a) doesn't add any extra relevant details beyond what can be inferred from the original passage.",

Without additional information indicating his friends actually know where to find safety, it's more likely Trey is simply sticking with them out of fear and a herd mentality rather than a belief they know the location of the safest place.

Most importantly, the passage states that as a result of this increased water intake, \"Jean feels much more healthy.\" \n\nSince Jean is directly experiencing the health benefits she was seeking by drinking more water, it's likely that these positive results will motivate her to maintain this new hydration habit.

This suggests an intense craving or fixation on cookies. \n\nWhen the parents stopped buying cookies, it's unlikely this craving would just disappear. Instead, the protagonist would probably feel very unhappy and dissatisfied about no longer having access to cookies at home. This unhappiness, combined with the intense cookie cravings, would likely motivate them to find other ways to get cookies to satisfy their desires, even without parental approval or support.\n\nSo (b) provides a more complete explanation aligned with the protagonist's cookie-obsessed behavior and probable emotional response to the cookie deprivation.
