While that could potentially be the cause, there are many other possibilities (battery, alternator, electrical issues, etc.) and we cannot assume Antonio has narrowed it down to the fuel system based on what is stated.\n\nTherefore, the more probable answer is simply that Antonio will take his car to a mechanic to have the problem checked out, without specifying a particular system he believes is at fault.",

This suggests a strong determination to go to that particular university.\n\nBy taking a year off to travel the world, Mike would likely gain valuable life experiences, broaden his perspective, and possibly engage in activities that would strengthen his college application. The time off provides an opportunity for personal growth and development that could make him a more appealing candidate.\n\nSince his primary goal seems to be attending Harvard, it's reasonable to think he would use the year strategically to improve his chances of getting accepted there in the future, rather than just reapplying with the same application as before.",

It's possible they were impressed by the content and presentation of the resume itself, regardless of paper color.\n\nWithout explicit evidence that the pink paper itself was the reason for the favorable impression, it would be an unwarranted assumption to conclude the protagonist would buy more pink paper for that reason. The more conservative and justifiable inference is simply that the protagonist may buy the pink paper again in the future if they had a positive experience with it and it remains an economical option.",

This suggests he developed certain beliefs and attitudes that motivated his criminal behavior. \n\nThe fact that he is now 35 years old and categorized as a \"career criminal\" implies he has continued committing crimes into adulthood. This pattern indicates his criminal mindset and value system likely remain unchanged from when he first started breaking the law as a 10-year-old.
