Option (a) suggests that Harry would find a way to dry his pants or change into a dry pair. However, the story does not provide any information to support this. In fact, it states that Harry was running late and had to quickly put on clothes from the dryer, implying he did not have time to ensure his pants were fully dry or to change into another pair.\n\n3. Option (b) adds additional information not provided in the original story - that Harry was very conscious of making a good impression and knew his discomfort could negatively impact his performance. While this could be a plausible explanation for why Harry might want to dry his pants or change into a dry pair, the story does not explicitly state this.\n\n4. When comparing the likelihood of two scenarios, we should generally favor the one that makes fewer unsupported assumptions. Option (a) does not introduce any new information, while option (b) adds an assumption about Harry's thought process that is not directly supported by the given story.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, option (a) is more likely - it sticks to the facts given in the story without introducing new assumptions.",

Most professors would likely be understanding in this situation.\n\n5. While the protagonist is probably worried about their grade, the primary motivation for contacting the professor is to explain the situation and find a resolution, not specifically because they are grade-focused.\n\nTherefore, option (a) \"The protagonist would likely contact their professor to explain the situation and request a makeup exam\" is more likely and sufficient. The additional detail in option (b) about being worried about their grade is extraneous and less relevant to the most likely course of action.\n\nSo the correct answer is (a) The protagonist would likely contact their professor to explain the situation and request a makeup exam.",

Option (a) states that Jenny would buy more dog food. This is a logical conclusion based on the fact that Jenny ran out of dog food and had to resort to feeding the dog leftover rice.\n\n4. Option (b) states that Jenny would buy more dog food because the dog liked the rice. While it's true that the dog enjoyed the rice, this doesn't necessarily mean that Jenny would buy more dog food because of this fact alone.\n\n5. The main reason for Jenny to buy more dog food is that she ran out of it, not because the dog liked the rice. The dog's enjoyment of the rice is an additional detail that doesn't directly influence the decision to purchase more dog food.\n\nTherefore, option (a) is more likely: Jenny would buy more dog food because she ran out of it, regardless of whether the dog liked the rice or not.",

However, while sitting during the commute, she realized it wasn't difficult at all.\n\n3. While the passage suggests that Nina had a positive experience with the subway, it does not explicitly mention that she found it more efficient or less stressful than she had expected.\n\n4. Adding these extra details in option (b) makes it a more specific statement compared to option (a). However, the passage does not provide enough information to support these additional claims.\n\n5. According to the principle of probability, a more general statement is more likely to be true than a more specific one. In this case, option (a) is a more general statement and is therefore more probable based on the information given in the passage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) Nina would likely use the subway for her future commutes.",

Ginette viewed this action as a sign of progress in their relationship.\n\nNow, let's consider the two options:\n\n(a) Ginette would likely encourage her husband to continue showing affection in small ways.\n- This option is supported by the fact that Ginette saw her husband's action as a positive step forward.\n- Encouraging small gestures of affection could help maintain the progress and potentially lead to more significant expressions of affection in the future.\n\n(b) Ginette would likely encourage her husband to continue showing affection in small ways because she felt that the pet on the head was a good starting point and hoped for further improvements.\n- This option includes all the points from option (a) and provides additional context about Ginette's perspective.\n- It emphasizes that Ginette viewed the head pat as a starting point and hoped for further improvements in their relationship.\n\nAfter analyzing both options, (b) appears to be more likely because it not only captures the essence of option (a) but also provides a more detailed explanation of Ginette's thought process and expectations.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (b) Ginette would likely encourage her husband to continue showing affection in small ways because she felt that the pet on the head was a good starting point and hoped for further improvements.",

This suggests Emil is likely sensitive and was deeply affected by the customer's angry outburst.\n\n4. Option (a) simply states Emil would apologize to the customer. However, given Emil's emotional reaction and the customer's unreasonable behavior, an apology seems unlikely without further elaboration.\n\n5. Option (b) provides the additional detail that Emil would apologize because he felt responsible for maintaining good customer service despite the stress.

If he was crying in the back, he may not be in an emotional state to come back out and apologize right away.\n\nTherefore, while neither option seems highly likely given Emil's reaction, option (a) is comparatively more probable than option (b).

When people experience something profound or moving, it's natural to want to capture or memorialize it in some way, such as through photography or art.

Both options suggest that the protagonist would likely sleep in or rest the next day. The difference is that option (b) provides a reason for this behavior (exhaustion from the busy day and the need to recover).\n\n3. The additional details in option (b) do not affect the probability of the protagonist sleeping in or resting the next day. The probability of the protagonist sleeping in or resting is the same in both options.\n\n4. According to the conjunction fallacy, the probability of two events occurring together (in \"conjunction\") is always less than or equal to the probability of either one occurring alone.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) The protagonist would likely sleep in or rest the next day. Option (a) is more probable than option (b), as it does not include the additional condition of the protagonist being exhausted and needing to recover, which makes option (b) a subset of option (a).",

The question does not provide any information about Jeremy's current beliefs, attitudes, or any efforts to reform.\n\n4. Given the lack of information about any change in Jeremy's beliefs or attitudes, it is more likely that he would continue to commit crimes based on his established pattern of behavior.\n\n5. The additional information in option (b) about Jeremy holding the same beliefs and attitudes that initially led him to commit crimes is not necessary to conclude that he would likely commit another crime.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) Jeremy would likely commit another crime.
