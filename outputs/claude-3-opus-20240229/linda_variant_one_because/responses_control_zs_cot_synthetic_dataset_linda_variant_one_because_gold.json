Option (b) is a conjunction of two events: \n   - Event 1: Tom arranging to pick up the Craigslist furniture.\n   - Event 2: Tom being eager to use the furniture to furnish his new apartment.\n\n4. A basic rule of probability states that the probability of a conjunction (A and B) is always less than or equal to the probability of its individual constituents (A or B).\n\n5. Therefore, the probability of option (a) occurring must be greater than or equal to the probability of option (b) occurring.\n\n6. The additional information in option (b) about Tom's eagerness and his new apartment, while possibly true, is extraneous to the probability calculation. It doesn't change the fundamental probability relationship between the single event and the conjunction.\n\nSo, based on the rules of probability, the correct answer is (a) - it is more likely that Tom would arrange to pick up the furniture he purchased on Craigslist, compared to the conjunction in option (b).\n\nThis illustrates the conjunction fallacy, where the narrative details can lead us astray from the pure probabilistic logic. By abstracting the problem and focusing on the probability models, we can avoid this common error in reasoning.",
