We have two options:\n   (a) Donald likely continues tanning despite his friends' concerns.\n   (b) Donald likely continues tanning despite his friends' concerns because he wants to maintain his unique appearance in his social circle.\n\n2. Option (a) is a single event: Donald continuing to tan despite his friends' concerns.\n\n3. Option (b) is a conjunction of two events: \n   - Event 1: Donald continuing to tan despite his friends' concerns.\n   - Event 2: Donald doing so because he wants to maintain a unique appearance.\n\n4.

The additional information about his motivation in option (b) is extraneous and actually reduces the probability compared to option (a).",

The question asks us to compare the probability of two events:\n   (a) The protagonist seeking medical attention for the bee sting.\n   (b) The protagonist seeking medical attention for the bee sting because they are allergic to bee stings.\n\n3. Option (b) is a conjunction of two events: the protagonist seeking medical attention AND the protagonist being allergic to bee stings.

Therefore, the probability of option (b) cannot be higher than the probability of option (a). Option (a) only involves a single event - seeking medical attention for the bee sting - regardless of the reason.\n\n5.
