The conjunction fallacy is a logical fallacy where people judge a more specific scenario (with extra details) to be more likely than a more general one.

Option (b) is a more specific version of (a), with the added detail of the protagonist's emotional connection to the ferret.\n\n3. While the extra information in option (b) might seem to make it more plausible from a narrative perspective, logically it cannot be more likely than option (a).

Option (b) states that Jenny would buy more dog food because the dog liked the rice. While this might seem plausible at first, it's important to note:\n   - Liking the rice is not a strong reason to buy dog food.

Option (a) states that Neil would seek help or reassurance from his friends, which seems like a plausible response given his sudden panic and the fact that he is out with friends.\n\n3.

In the story, the protagonist was stung by a bee after accidentally picking up a bees nest that looked like a pear.\n\n2. Most people who are stung by a bee do not require medical attention. Bee stings are usually painful and may cause localized swelling, but they are not typically dangerous for the vast majority of people.\n\n3. However, some people are allergic to bee stings. For those who are allergic, a bee sting can cause a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) that requires immediate medical attention.\n\n4. The story does not provide any information about whether the protagonist is allergic to bee stings or not.\n\n5. Without the additional information about an allergy, it is more probable that the protagonist is not allergic, simply because bee sting allergies are relatively uncommon in the general population.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the story, option (a) is more likely: The protagonist would likely seek medical attention for the bee sting, but not necessarily because they are allergic to bee stings.\n\nThe added detail in option (b) about the allergy, while possible, is not supported by the information given and makes the scenario less probable compared to option (a).",
