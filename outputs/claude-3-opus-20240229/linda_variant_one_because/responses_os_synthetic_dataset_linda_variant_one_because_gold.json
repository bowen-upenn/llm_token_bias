However, option (b) adds an additional detail about why Tom was eager to get the furniture (to furnish his new apartment). This extra information, while potentially true, is not directly supported by the original text. \n\nIn probability terms, option (a) is more likely because it only includes information explicitly stated in the passage, while option (b) includes an unsupported assumption. When comparing probabilities, the option with fewer assumptions is generally more likely to be correct.",
