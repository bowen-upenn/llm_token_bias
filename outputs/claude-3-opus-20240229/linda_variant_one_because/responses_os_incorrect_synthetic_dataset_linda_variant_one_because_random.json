The tall grass makes it hard to see the toys, increasing the chances of running over more if he doesn't remove them first. \n3. The additional detail about rain later in the day in option (b) is not necessary to explain why Robert would collect the toys. His direct experience of already damaging some toys is sufficient motivation to avoid damaging more, regardless of the weather forecast.\n\nSo while both options describe Robert collecting the toys before continuing to mow, option (a) provides the simplest and most probable explanation based solely on the key relevant information provided in the original scenario.
