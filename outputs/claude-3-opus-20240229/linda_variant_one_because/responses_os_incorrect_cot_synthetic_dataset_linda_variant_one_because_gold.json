Replacing a garage door is a significant repair that most homeowners would not have the skills or tools to do themselves.\n\n4. When facing a large home repair, it's common for homeowners to contact professionals, such as repair services or contractors, who have the expertise to properly fix the issue.\n\n5. While home security is a valid concern for any homeowner, the passage doesn't explicitly mention Dan's worries about security without a garage door.\n\n6. The passage focuses more on Dan's realization that the garage door needs to be replaced due to the storm damage.\n\nBased on the information provided and our step-by-step analysis, option (a) \"Dan would likely contact a repair service or contractor to replace his garage door\" is more likely. The passage emphasizes the need for replacing the damaged door, which most homeowners would require professional help with, without explicitly mentioning security concerns as the primary reason.",

However, this additional salt made the dish too salty. This indicates that there is a tipping point where adding more salt becomes detrimental to the taste.\n\n3. Despite the dish being too salty, he ate it anyway. This could imply that he is not one to waste food, or perhaps he was hungry enough to eat it regardless of the taste.\n\n4. The question is whether he is more likely to simply add less salt next time (option a) or if he would add less salt because he learned that too much salt makes the dish too salty (option b).\n\n5. Given that he experienced firsthand the negative effects of adding too much salt, it is more likely that he would internalize this lesson and consciously choose to add less salt in the future to avoid over-salting his food.\n\nTherefore, option (b) is more likely: The protagonist would likely add less salt next time because he learned that adding too much made the dish too salty. He has gained the knowledge through direct experience that there is an optimal amount of salt, and exceeding that amount leads to an undesirable taste.

She tried calling a friend for a ride but was unsuccessful.\n3. She decided to take the subway as an alternative, despite having never taken one before.\n4. During her commute, she realized that taking the subway wasn't difficult at all.\n\nNow, let's consider the two options:\n\n(a) Nina would likely use the subway for her future commutes.\n- This option is plausible because Nina discovered that taking the subway was not as challenging as she had anticipated. Having a positive first experience might encourage her to consider the subway for future commutes.\n\n(b) Nina would likely use the subway for her future commutes because she found it more efficient and less stressful than she had expected.\n- This option provides more context as to why Nina would likely use the subway for future commutes. It suggests that not only was the subway easier than she thought, but it was also more efficient and less stressful compared to her prior expectations.\n\nConsidering the additional information provided in option (b), which offers a more comprehensive explanation for Nina's future behavior, I would choose (b) as the more likely scenario.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (b) Nina would likely use the subway for her future commutes because she found it more efficient and less stressful than she had expected.",

This makes sense given their close friendship and how Sam helped Alexis train to make the team. So the core action (celebrating together) is equally likely in both options.\n\n2. The key difference is that option (b) provides additional context for why they would celebrate - \"because they were determined to enjoy their shared success together.\" This adds meaningful detail that fits the story.\n\n3. Option (a) is more concise but doesn't elaborate on their motivations. It's not incorrect, but (b) paints a more complete picture.\n\n4. Considering Sam helped Alexis train all year after Alexis didn't make the initial cut, it's reasonable to infer they were both invested in achieving the goal of making the team together. Celebrating the shared success they worked towards is a logical outcome.\n\n5. Therefore, while both are plausible, option (b) is more likely since it provides relevant added detail that aligns with the context provided in the question.\n\nSo after analyzing each option, I believe (b) is the more likely scenario: The protagonist, Sam, would celebrate with Alexis after they both made the soccer team because they were determined to enjoy their shared success together.",

Since he was committed enough to save up for two months to buy the skateboard initially, it's likely that he would be willing to save up again or find another way to replace the broken board.\n\nTherefore, option (b) \"Reese would likely buy a new skateboard because he doesn't want to give up skateboarding just because of one accident\" is more likely, as it takes into account Reese's dedication to skateboarding and his likelihood to persist despite the setback.",

This suggests that he would want to ensure she receives proper treatment.\n\nStep 2: Following medical advice.\nSince the doctor's assistant prescribed three medications after examining the wife and ordering an X-ray, it is likely that the protagonist would trust the medical professional's judgment and follow their advice.\n\nStep 3: The protagonist's hope for the medications to work.\nThe protagonist's statement, \"I hope they work,\" indicates that he wants his wife to recover and believes the prescribed medications will help her get better.\n\nConsidering the protagonist's concern for his wife's health, his trust in the medical professional's advice, and his hope for the medications to be effective, it is more likely that (b) is the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, (b) The protagonist would likely administer or ensure his wife takes the prescribed medications because he is concerned about her health and wants to see her recover quickly.",

The girlfriend broke up with him, which would likely cause emotional pain and a desire to move on from the relationship.\n\n3. He went back to the tattoo artist to have the tattoo changed into an eagle. This suggests he wanted to transform the tattoo into something new, possibly to cover up the reminder of his ex-girlfriend.\n\n4. Option (a) states that he might show off his new eagle tattoo, which is plausible given the effort he made to change the original tattoo.\n\n5. Option (b) provides additional context, suggesting that he might show off the eagle tattoo specifically to cover up the painful memory of his past relationship.\n\nConsidering the context and the man's actions, option (b) seems more likely. The transformation of the tattoo into an eagle appears to be a direct response to the breakup, and showing off the new tattoo could serve as a way to assert his moving on from the relationship and covering up the painful memory associated with the original tattoo.\n\nTherefore, option (b) \"The protagonist might show off his new eagle tattoo because he wants to cover up the painful memory of his past relationship\" is more likely based on the given information.",

Upon receiving negative feedback and being laughed at, James has two main options:\n   a. Give up on his dream of being a novelist.\n   b.

The experience of missing the test and the subsequent second chance may serve as a wake-up call for Tim, highlighting the importance of effective study habits and time management.\n\n5.

Emil's reaction of running to the back and crying implies that he was overwhelmed by the customer's aggressive behavior and likely felt unfairly treated.\n\n4.

Pete's immediate reaction was to decide to go back to New Jersey, suggesting he was not initially considering other options to make living in Brooklyn work.\n\n3. Option (a) suggests that Pete would look for more affordable housing or consider finding a roommate. This seems plausible, as these are common solutions when faced with high housing costs.\n\n4.

Jeremy's criminal behavior started at a young age (around 10) and was influenced by older kids who were involved in criminal activities. This suggests his beliefs and attitudes were shaped early on to view criminal behavior as acceptable or \"cool\".\n\n2. The fact that Jeremy is now 35 and categorized as a \"career criminal\" indicates that his criminal behavior has persisted into adulthood. Being labeled a career criminal suggests a long-term pattern of repeated offenses.\n\n3. Jeremy's current incarceration at age 35 is another strong indicator that his criminal tendencies have continued well into adulthood. \n\n4. While option (a) correctly asserts that Jeremy is likely to commit another crime based on his history, option (b) provides additional key context as to why he is likely to reoffend. \n\n5. Option (b) highlights that Jeremy likely still holds the same beliefs and attitudes that originally led him to criminal behavior. Given his long-term pattern of criminality into adulthood, it's reasonable to infer his mindset and worldview that were shaped in his youth have remained largely unchanged.\n\nTherefore, option (b) is more likely and provides a fuller explanation. Jeremy's risk of recidivism is high not just because of his criminal history, but because the underlying beliefs and attitudes driving his criminal behavior appear entrenched given his trajectory from youth to a 35-year-old career criminal.",

Despite his fear of heights, Yannick accepted the challenge from his friends to go up the Empire State Building. This demonstrates that he is willing to step out of his comfort zone and take on challenges.\n\n3. After going up the Empire State Building, Yannick sent many beautiful pictures to his friends. This indicates that he enjoys capturing and sharing his experiences through photographs.\n\n4. Given that Yannick has already visited one iconic landmark (the Empire State Building) and shared pictures with his friends, it is likely that he would continue this pattern with other famous landmarks in New York City.\n\nNow, let's compare the two options:\n\n(a) Yannick would likely visit other iconic landmarks in New York City and send pictures to his friends.\n- This option is supported by the information provided in the question and the analysis above.\n\n(b) Yannick would likely visit other iconic landmarks in New York City and send pictures to his friends because he enjoys photography as a hobby.\n- While this option is similar to option (a), it adds an additional piece of information about Yannick enjoying photography as a hobby.
