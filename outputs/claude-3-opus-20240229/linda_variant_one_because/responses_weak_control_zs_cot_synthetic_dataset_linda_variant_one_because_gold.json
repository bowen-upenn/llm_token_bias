This suggests he was likely in a rush and may not have had much time to carefully select his outfit.\n\n2. He had to quickly put on clothes straight from the dryer, which turned out to still be wet. This implies he did not have time to ensure his clothes were fully dry.\n\n3. Upon realizing his pants were wet at the interview, he felt very uncomfortable. This discomfort was likely noticeable to the interviewer.\n\n4. The fact that he didn't get the job suggests his discomfort and the wet pants may have negatively impacted his performance and the impression he made.\n\n5. Option (a) suggests Harry would find a way to quickly dry his pants or change into a dry pair. However, given the context that he was already at the interview when he realized the issue, it's unlikely he had the opportunity or means to do so.\n\n6. Option (b) adds the additional detail that Harry was very conscious of making a good impression. While this may be true, it doesn't change the fact that he was already at the interview with wet pants and likely had no practical way to remedy the situation.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, option (a) is more likely. The additional detail in option (b), while possibly true, does not make it more likely than option (a) given the circumstances Harry was already in at the interview.",

We know from the given information that:\n   - Tom bought several pieces of affordable furniture on Craigslist\n   - The transactions all went smoothly\n\n3. Based on this, it's highly likely that Tom would arrange to pick up the furniture he purchased, as that's the natural next step after making a successful purchase on Craigslist.\n\n4. Option (b) adds an additional detail - that Tom is eager to use the furniture to furnish his new apartment. While this could be true, it's an extra piece of information not provided in the original context.\n\n5. According to probability theory, the probability of two events occurring together (a conjunction) is always less than or equal to the probability of either event occurring alone.\n\nTherefore, option (a) is more likely than option (b). The additional detail in (b) makes it a more specific scenario, which reduces its probability compared to the more general case described in (a).\n\nSo, the answer is (a) Tom would arrange to pick up the furniture he purchased on Craigslist.",
