It does not provide any information about an upcoming job interview or Jason's desire to look neat for a specific occasion. Therefore, while both options are plausible, option (a) is more directly supported by the given context.",

This suggests that Cora likely followed the doctor's instructions and took the antibiotics as prescribed, which led to her recovery.\n\nWhile option (b) provides a possible reason for Cora to take her antibiotics as prescribed (to avoid getting sick again), the passage does not explicitly mention this motivation.
