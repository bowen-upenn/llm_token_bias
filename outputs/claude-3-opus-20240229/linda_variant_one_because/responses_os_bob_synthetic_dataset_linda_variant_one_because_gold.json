It also suggests that his discomfort was obvious to the interviewer, which may have contributed to him not getting the job. Given these details, it's reasonable to assume that Harry was conscious of making a good impression and understood that his discomfort could negatively impact his performance during the interview.",

Antonio himself may suspect various potential causes, but as readers, we do not have enough information to pinpoint the fuel injection system as the likely culprit. He would need a mechanic to investigate the problem and determine the specific cause and solution.\n\nTherefore, while visiting a mechanic is the most probable next step, there isn't sufficient evidence to assume the fuel injection system is the source of the problem.

This strongly suggests that her current job does not fulfill her on a personal level and does not align with the values and skills she developed through her social work degree. \n\nSo it seems quite probable that Amber would consider pursuing a different career path, either by finding a new job that is a better fit, or potentially going back to school to gain additional education and qualifications to open up new career opportunities.

Emil was already doing his best to fill orders and the customer's angry yelling was unjustified. \n\nWhile it's possible Emil may later feel a professional responsibility to smooth things over for customer service reasons (as option b suggests), in the immediate aftermath of being berated to the point of tears, a direct apology from Emil seems improbable. He is more likely to be upset and shaken up rather than ready to re-engage the customer with an apology.\n\nSo between the two options, (a) is more likely, even though based on the scenario details, neither Emil apologizing nor giving an explanation for it seem very probable. The question requires choosing between the two stated possibilities though, and (a) is the relatively more plausible one.",

It's more likely that he would suspect the sandwiches were the cause of his illness, as food contamination and food-borne illnesses are more common in such settings due to potentially lower hygiene standards and lack of proper food safety regulations.

Without any mention of rehabilitation, changed mindset or circumstances, the description points to Jeremy still having the same criminogenic beliefs and attitudes that drove his initial offending. This makes him at high risk of recidivism.\n\nSo while both (a) and (b) predict he will likely reoffend, (b) is the more complete explanation by identifying the likely underlying cause - his unchanged criminal attitudes. The passage supports that his belief system and identity as a criminal, not just external factors, are driving his persistent offending into adulthood.",
