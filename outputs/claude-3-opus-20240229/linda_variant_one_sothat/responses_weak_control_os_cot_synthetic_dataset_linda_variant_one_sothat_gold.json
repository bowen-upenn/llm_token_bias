The granddaughter survived and is now two years old.\n\nNow, let's compare the two options:\n\n(a) The protagonist would likely celebrate their granddaughter's second birthday.\n- This statement is a general assumption that the family would celebrate the child's second birthday, as it is a common milestone to celebrate.\n\n(b) The protagonist would likely celebrate their granddaughter's second birthday so that they could commemorate her overcoming such immense challenges early in life.\n- This statement not only assumes that the family would celebrate the child's second birthday but also provides a specific reason for the celebration: to commemorate the granddaughter's ability to overcome the challenges associated with her premature birth.\n\nWhen comparing the two options, option (b) is more specific and provides additional relevant information. However, this additional information does not make option (b) more likely than option (a).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is No. Both options are equally likely, as they both assume the family would celebrate the granddaughter's second birthday, with option (b) only providing additional context for the celebration.",

Statement B adds an additional detail - the reason why Jim would finish the cereal is \"so that he wouldn't have to waste food.\" \n\n3. Logically, the probability of two events both occurring (Jim finishing the cereal AND his motivation being to not waste food) cannot be higher than the probability of just one of those events occurring (Jim finishing the cereal, regardless of his motivation).\n\n4. Therefore, the probability of statement B cannot be higher than the probability of statement A. At best, it can be equal if the reason given in B is actually true.\n\n5. Since we are asked which scenario is more likely, and B cannot be more likely than A, then the answer cannot be B. Either A is more likely, or they are equally likely, but B cannot be more likely.\n\nTherefore, the logically sound answer is No, B cannot be more likely than A in this question as posed. This is an example of the conjunction fallacy, where a more specific scenario is judged to be more likely than a more general one that includes it.",

Option (b) is a more specific case of option (a). Every instance of (b) is also an instance of (a), but not vice versa.\n\n4.

Statement (b) cannot be more likely than statement (a) because it makes an assumption (the couple having a baby) that is not supported by the given information.\n\n5.

The given information does not provide any evidence that Zack would specifically repair or restore his car to drive it in the spring and summer.\n\n6.
