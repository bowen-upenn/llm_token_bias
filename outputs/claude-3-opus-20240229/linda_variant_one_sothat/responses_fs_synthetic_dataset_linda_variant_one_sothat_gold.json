The passage states the fluorescent Q-tips were weaker than regular ones and that the protagonist got the regular ones the next time, but it does not explicitly say they chose regular Q-tips specifically because they wanted stronger ones in the future. Option (a) sticks to only what can be deduced from the given information, so it is the more probable answer.",
