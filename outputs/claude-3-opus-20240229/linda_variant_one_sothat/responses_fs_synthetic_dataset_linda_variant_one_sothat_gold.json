The protagonist doing Hilda the favor of picking up cigarettes doesn't necessarily imply they want to continue doing so, especially without being paid back.\n\nSo in the absence of more context, the protagonist simply requesting the money owed for the previous carton seems more likely than them trying to collect money preemptively for a future cigarette purchase.

Simply helping her communicate this complaint to the manager, as suggested in option (a), may not fully address the root issue - her preference for mail notifications over email.\n\nOption (b) goes a step further by suggesting the protagonist could help Eve secure a guarantee of future notifications by mail. This would directly address her concerns and communication preferences to prevent similar upset in the future.\n\nSo while both options involve supporting Eve, (b) provides a more thorough solution aligned with her specific needs that were highlighted in the scenario.
