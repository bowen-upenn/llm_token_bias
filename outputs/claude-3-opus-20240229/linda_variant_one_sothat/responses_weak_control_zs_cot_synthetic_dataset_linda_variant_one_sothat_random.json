Option (a) is a simple statement that Tom would pay the ticket. This is a fairly likely outcome, as most people would choose to pay a ticket they received to avoid further legal consequences.\n\n3. Option (b) contains all the information in option (a), but also adds an additional condition - that Tom is paying the ticket so he can have dinner with his friends later.

His actions show a lack of respect for her wishes and boundaries.\n\n2. The additional detail in option (b) about James wanting to borrow Nancy's chemistry notes is irrelevant to the likelihood of him apologizing. In fact, it makes the scenario more specific and therefore less probable than the general scenario in option (a).\n\n3. The conjunction fallacy leads people to mistakenly believe that more specific conditions are more probable than general ones. However, the rules of probability dictate that the probability of two events occurring together (a conjunction) is always less than or equal to the probability of either one occurring alone.\n\n4.

The question presents a classic example of the conjunction fallacy, where people tend to mistakenly believe that a more specific scenario is more probable than a general one.\n\n2. Option (a) states that Don would show off his new boots. This is a general statement that doesn't provide any additional context or conditions.\n\n3. Option (b) also states that Don would show off his new boots, but it adds an additional condition: \"so that he could feel more prepared for a potential snowstorm.\" This option is more specific than option (a).\n\n4. According to probability theory, the probability of two events occurring together (a conjunction) is always less than or equal to the probability of either event occurring alone.\n\n5. Therefore, the probability of Don showing off his new boots and feeling prepared for a potential snowstorm (option b) cannot be greater than the probability of Don simply showing off his new boots (option a).\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is (a) Don would show off his new boots. Option (a) is more likely than option (b) because it does not include the additional condition of feeling prepared for a potential snowstorm.",

Option (b) combines the likely outcome of seeking medical attention with an unrelated detail about wanting to learn about a new recipe. The desire to learn a recipe is not relevant to the urgent medical situation at hand.\n\n4. The addition of the unrelated detail in (b) makes it a less likely scenario than (a). Seeking medical care and wanting to learn a recipe are two independent events, and their conjunction cannot be more probable than either event alone.\n\nTherefore, by the logic of probability, option (a) is more likely than option (b). This question illustrates the conjunction fallacy, where people erroneously judge the likelihood of a combination of events as more probable than a single event on its own.",
