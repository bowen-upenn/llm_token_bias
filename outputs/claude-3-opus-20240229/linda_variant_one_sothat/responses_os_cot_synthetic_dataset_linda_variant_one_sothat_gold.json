Statement (b) provides a reason why Tom would pay the ticket - so that he could continue using his new car stereo without further issues.\n\n4. Given that Tom was excited about his new car stereo (he was trying it out and driving around with it cranked up), it's reasonable to assume that he would want to continue using it without getting into more trouble.\n\n5. Paying the ticket would allow Tom to resolve the current issue and avoid further problems that might prevent him from enjoying his new stereo.\n\nTherefore, statement (b) is more likely because it provides a plausible motivation for Tom's action that aligns with the context provided in the scenario.\n\nSo, is statement (b) more likely than statement (a)?

The protagonist threatened the boy by offering to \"rearrange his face.\"\n4.

The protagonist has already achieved their apparent goal of scaring the boy and making him run away.\n2.

The passage states the granddaughter was born very prematurely, weighing only 1 pound 6 ounces, which classifies her as a \"micro preemie\". This indicates she faced significant health challenges at birth.\n\n2. The family was worried about her survival, implying her situation was very serious and her chances of survival were uncertain. \n\n3. The granddaughter is now two years old, meaning she survived despite the odds against her.\n\n4. Reaching the age of two is a significant milestone, especially for a child born so prematurely with such a low birth weight. It represents a triumph over the challenges she faced.\n\n5. Given the immense difficulties the child overcame and the family's initial worries, it's very likely they would want to celebrate her second birthday as a special occasion commemorating her resilience and survival.\n\nTherefore, option (b) is more likely than option (a). The birthday celebration would hold extra significance due to the granddaughter's early struggles and unlikely survival, making it an occasion to honor her strength in overcoming those challenges.",

Statement (b) adds an additional detail: that Don would show off his boots specifically to receive compliments from his friends. While this is possible, the passage doesn't provide any information about Don's friends or his desire for compliments.\n\nTherefore, statement (a) is more likely because it directly follows from the information given in the passage, while statement (b) includes an extra assumption that is not directly supported by the given information.\n\nSo, the answer is Yes, statement (a) is more likely than statement (b).",

They investigated the sound but found nothing.\n4. Marshal and his friends stayed awake the entire night.\n\nNow, let's consider the two options:\n\n(a) Marshall would likely continue telling more horror stories to his friends around the campfire.\n\nThis option suggests that despite the strange sound and the sleepless night, Marshall would continue telling horror stories simply because he enjoys doing so. However, it doesn't take into account the impact of the strange sound on Marshall and his friends.\n\n(b) Marshall would likely continue telling more horror stories to his friends around the campfire so that they could try to explain the strange sounds they heard.\n\nThis option considers that Marshall and his friends were disturbed by the strange sound and couldn't sleep the entire night. By continuing to tell horror stories, they might be trying to rationalize or explain the strange sound they heard, possibly to ease their anxiety or to find a logical explanation.\n\nBased on the given information, option (b) seems more likely because it takes into account the context of the strange sound and its impact on Marshall and his friends. The strange sound they heard would likely influence their behavior and decision to continue telling horror stories in an attempt to explain or rationalize the event.\n\nTherefore, the more likely option is (b) Marshall would likely continue telling more horror stories to his friends around the campfire so that they could try to explain the strange sounds they heard.",

The bird sat on the table and chirped, indicating it was not immediately flying out.\n\nNow, let's assess the two options:\n\n(a) Jen would gently approach the bird to guide it towards an open window or door.\n- This option aligns with Jen's goal of helping the bird leave the house safely.\n- A gentle approach is more likely to keep the bird calm and less threatened.\n\n(b) Jen would gently approach the bird to guide it towards an open window or door so that it might feel less threatened and safely find its way outside.\n- This option also aligns with Jen's goal and the gentle approach.\n- It provides additional reasoning behind the gentle approach, considering the bird's feelings and safety.\n\nComparing the two options, both suggest the same action of gently guiding the bird towards an open window or door. However, option (b) provides a more detailed explanation of why Jen would choose this approach.\n\nTherefore, option (b) is more likely, as it offers a more comprehensive reasoning behind Jen's probable course of action.",

The protagonist was born into a Catholic family with tight religious values.\n2. Over time, the protagonist's morals and values changed, leading them to give up religion and not believe in God.\n3. The family took this change harshly and felt insulted.\n4. It took some time for the family to come to terms with the protagonist's decision.\n\nStep 1: Consider option (a)\n- The protagonist might engage in open discussions about their beliefs with their family.\n- This option suggests that the protagonist is willing to discuss their beliefs openly with their family.\n- However, it doesn't provide any specific reason or purpose for these discussions.\n\nStep 2: Consider option (b)\n- The protagonist might engage in open discussions about their beliefs with their family so that they can learn to understand each other better despite their differences.\n- This option also suggests that the protagonist is willing to discuss their beliefs openly with their family.\n- Additionally, it provides a specific reason for these discussions: to foster better understanding between the protagonist and their family, despite their differing beliefs.\n\nStep 3: Compare the options\n- Both options involve the protagonist engaging in open discussions about their beliefs with their family.\n- Option (b) provides a more comprehensive and purposeful reason for these discussions, which is to improve understanding and acceptance within the family.\n\nStep 4: Consider the context\n- The family initially took the protagonist's decision harshly and felt insulted.\n- It took some time for the family to come to terms with the protagonist's beliefs.\n- This suggests that the family struggled to understand and accept the protagonist's perspective at first.\n\nStep 5: Draw a conclusion\n- Given the context of the family's initial reaction and the time it took for them to come to terms with the protagonist's beliefs, option (b) appears more likely.\n- Engaging in open discussions with the specific purpose of fostering understanding and acceptance aligns with the protagonist's goal of maintaining a positive relationship with their family despite their differences in beliefs.\n\nTherefore, option (b) is more likely: The protagonist might engage in open discussions about their beliefs with their family so that they can learn to understand each other better despite their differences.",

Given the severity of the situation and the potential legal consequences, it is more likely that Tyler's primary concern would be to minimize his punishment rather than simply express remorse.\n\n5. Apologizing with the hope of receiving a lighter sentence is a common tactic used by defendants to appear remorseful and convince the judge to be more lenient.\n\nTherefore, option (b) is more likely: Tyler would apologize for his actions so that he could potentially receive a lighter sentence from the judge.",

Understand the situation:\n   - Cara snuck out to a party without her parents' permission.\n   - Her little brother caught her and told their parents.\n   - Cara's parents were furious and grounded her for two months.\n\n2. Consider option (a):\n   - Apologizing for sneaking out shows that Cara recognizes her mistake and feels remorseful.\n   - This apology doesn't have any explicit expectation of reducing the grounding period.\n   - It demonstrates Cara's willingness to take responsibility for her actions.\n\n3. Consider option (b):\n   - This apology also shows that Cara recognizes her mistake.\n   - However, the added intention of requesting a reduced grounding period suggests that Cara's primary motivation is to lessen her punishment.\n   - It might come across as less sincere, as the apology is tied to an expectation of leniency.\n\n4. Compare the likelihood of each option:\n   - Given Cara's situation, it is more probable that she would prioritize showing genuine remorse to her parents.\n   - Attempting to negotiate a reduced punishment might further aggravate her parents, who are already furious.\n   - A sincere apology without expectations is more likely to be well-received and may naturally lead to a reconsideration of the grounding period.\n\nTherefore, option (a) is more likely: Cara might apologize to her parents for sneaking out, without explicitly seeking a reduction in her grounding period.",

Ralph invited Georgia to a movie as a way to thank her for warning him about the party.\n\nNow, let's analyze the two options:\n\n(a) Georgia would likely accept Ralph's invitation to the movie.\n- This option is a straightforward conclusion based on the information provided. Ralph invited Georgia to the movie as a gesture of gratitude, and there's no indication that Georgia would decline the invitation.\n\n(b) Georgia would likely accept Ralph's invitation to the movie so that they could spend some time together discussing the party.\n- While this option is plausible, there's no explicit evidence in the passage to suggest that Georgia and Ralph would spend time discussing the party during the movie. The primary reason for the movie invitation seems to be Ralph's desire to thank Georgia for her considerate action.\n\nBased on the given information, option (a) appears to be more likely because it directly follows from the events described in the passage, without making additional assumptions about Georgia and Ralph's intentions to discuss the party further.",

According to the passage, Tommy (or Donald) initially had favorite shows, but they weren't on. \n\n3. He had to watch shows he didn't like instead.\n\n4. After watching these new shows a lot, Tommy grew to like them, and they became his new favorite shows.\n\n5. Option (a) says that Tommy would continue watching his new favorite shows.
