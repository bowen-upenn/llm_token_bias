He explained what happened but still got ticketed.\nWhich is more likely?\n(a) Tom would pay the ticket.\n(b) Tom would pay the ticket so that he could have dinner with his friends later that evening.",

        "init_model_answer": "To determine which is more likely, let's break this down step-by-step:\n\n1. The question asks which of the two options is more likely:\n   (a) Tom would pay the ticket.\n   (b) Tom would pay the ticket so that he could have dinner with his friends later that evening.\n\n2. Both options involve Tom paying the ticket. The difference is that option (b) adds additional information about Tom's motivation for paying the ticket - to have dinner with his friends later that evening.\n\n3. The passage does not provide any information about Tom's plans for the evening or his motivation for paying the ticket. The fact that he would have dinner with friends is new information not supported by the passage.\n\n4. When comparing the likelihood of two options, the one that makes fewer unsupported assumptions is generally more likely.\n\n5. Option (a) does not make any unsupported assumptions. It simply states that Tom would pay the ticket, which is a reasonable outcome given that he was caught and ticketed for his actions.\n\n6. Option (b), on the other hand, makes an additional assumption about Tom's evening plans and motivations that is not supported by the information provided.\n\nTherefore, option (a) \"Tom would pay the ticket\" is more likely, as it does not rely on unsupported assumptions, while option (b) introduces new information not found in the passage.",
