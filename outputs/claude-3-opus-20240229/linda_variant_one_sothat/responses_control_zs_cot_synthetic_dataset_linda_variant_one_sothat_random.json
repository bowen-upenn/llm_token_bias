Option (a) is a single event: Tom paying the ticket.\n\n3. Option (b) is a conjunction of two events: Tom paying the ticket AND Tom having dinner with his friends later that evening.\n\n4. According to probability theory, the probability of a single event is always greater than or equal to the probability of a conjunction of events.\n\n5. This is because for the conjunction to be true, both constituent events must be true. The addition of the second event (having dinner with friends) makes the overall probability lower or at best equal to the probability of just paying the ticket alone.\n\n6.
