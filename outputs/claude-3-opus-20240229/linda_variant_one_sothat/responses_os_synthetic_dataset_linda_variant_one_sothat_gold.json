Spending quality time together whenever he could aligns with those facts.\n\nWhile option (b) also fits and provides additional context, it goes a bit beyond the core information given by speculating more about James' specific motivations and thought process. The prompt doesn't explicitly state he spent time with her \"so that he could maintain their close relationship and ensure his child felt loved and supported.\" Those things may very well be true, but (a) is the simpler, more direct answer that requires less unsupported assumptions.\n\nSo in comparing the two, (a) is the more strictly probable answer based solely on the details provided in the prompt. Selecting (b) relies more on unstated inferences, even if they are reasonable ones. The principle of parsimony would favor (a) as the most likely option given only the information available.",

This additional detail, while plausible, makes option (b) less probable than option (a) which simply states the core action Phil is likely to take without specifying the exact reason.\n\nIn general, adding more specificity to a statement narrows its probability compared to a more general statement. So the simpler, more general option (a) is inherently more probable than (b) which includes (a) plus additional details.",
