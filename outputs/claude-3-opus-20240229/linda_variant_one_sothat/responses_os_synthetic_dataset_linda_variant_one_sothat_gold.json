Nathan's mom climbed up to the roof to reach the rocket.\nWhich is more likely?\n(a) Nathan would likely launch the rocket again.\n(b) Nathan would likely launch the rocket again so that it lands on the roof once more.",

        "init_model_answer": "Yes, (a) is more likely than (b). It's reasonable to expect Nathan would want to launch his new toy rocket again after retrieving it. However, it's unlikely he would deliberately try to get it stuck on the roof a second time, as that caused inconvenience for his mom to retrieve it with a ladder.",

Knowing the gender would allow Kim to decorate the nursery accordingly, so statement (b) is the more likely outcome.",
