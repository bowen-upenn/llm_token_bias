The story implies Tom was stopped by the police and ticketed for having his music cranked up too loudly. In most cases, when someone gets an official ticket from law enforcement, they pay it to avoid additional fines or legal consequences, regardless of their reason for committing the initial offense.

The fact that he got into 3 fights already upon returning from vacation suggests a strong pattern of argumentative behavior.\n\nWhile intellectual dominance could be one motivation, option (b) makes an additional assumption about his specific reasons that isn't clearly supported. The passage portrays Harry as argumentative overall, but doesn't specify that establishing intellectual dominance is necessarily the driver behind that argumentativeness in every case.\n\nSo while (b) is possible, (a) aligns more closely with the details provided - that Harry is likely to start more arguments with people in general, continuing his established argumentative tendencies. The passage supports (a) more directly than the narrower intellectual dominance motivation asserted in (b).",
