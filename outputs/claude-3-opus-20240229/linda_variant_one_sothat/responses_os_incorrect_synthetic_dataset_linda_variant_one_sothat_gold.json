In this situation, it's more probable that Phil would not only call for help, but also ask the mechanic or roadside assistance to find the nearest repair shop to tow his car for further inspection and repairs. Simply calling for help (option a) is less comprehensive than option (b), which includes finding a repair shop and towing the car.",
