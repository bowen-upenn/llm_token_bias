He immediately knew he wanted to write about tigers and spent significant effort researching the subject, even going to the zoo. This suggests he has a strong intrinsic motivation to learn about topics that fascinate him.\n\nWhile the positive outcome (good grade, entertaining his classmates) was a nice result, it doesn't appear to be Jackson's primary drive.

The vacation helped Stanley successfully lower his blood pressure, demonstrating that lifestyle changes and relaxation had a positive impact on his condition. \n\n3.
