This is a straightforward outcome given the situation. If Tom was ticketed, it's likely that he would pay the fine to resolve the issue.\n\n2. Statement (b) says that Tom would pay the ticket so that he could continue to use his new car stereo without further issues. This statement assumes an additional motivation for Tom to pay the ticket beyond just resolving the issue at hand.\n\n3. Paying the ticket would resolve the immediate issue of the ticket itself, regardless of Tom's future intentions with his car stereo.\n\n4. While it's possible that Tom would be motivated to pay the ticket to avoid further issues with using his car stereo, this additional reasoning is not necessary for him to choose to pay the ticket.\n\n5. Occam's Razor, a principle that states that the simplest explanation is usually the most likely one, would favor statement (a) over statement (b). Statement (a) provides a sufficient explanation without adding additional assumptions.\n\nTherefore, statement (a), \"Tom would pay the ticket,\" is more likely than statement (b). The additional reasoning in statement (b) is not necessary to explain why Tom would pay the ticket.",

His paper received a high grade and entertained his classmates.\n\nNow, let's consider the two options:\n\n(a) Jackson might choose to write more reports on other animals or subjects he enjoys.\n- This statement focuses on Jackson's personal interest and enjoyment in the topic.\n- It suggests that his primary motivation for writing future reports would be his own passion for the subject matter.\n\n(b) Jackson might choose to write more reports on other animals or subjects he enjoys so that he can continue to receive high grades and entertain his classmates.\n- This statement includes the same idea as (a) - that Jackson would write about topics he enjoys.\n- However, it adds the additional motivation of seeking high grades and entertaining his classmates.\n\nWhen comparing the two, statement (a) is more likely because:\n- Jackson's primary motivation seems to be his own interest and enjoyment in the topic, as evidenced by his choice of tigers and the effort he put into researching them.\n- While grades and classmate reactions are positive outcomes, they don't appear to be his main drive.\n- Statement (b) adds extra assumptions about Jackson's motivations that are not directly supported by the information provided.\n\nTherefore, the answer is Yes, statement (a) is more likely than statement (b).",

The question does not provide any information about the protagonist's character, motives or interests. We cannot assume the protagonist would be likely to run onto a sports field during a game in the first place. There is insufficient information to assess the general likelihood of scenario (a).\n\n2. Scenario (b) is a more specific version of (a), with the added detail that the motive is to get a selfie with a favorite player. Again, without knowing more about the protagonist's personality and fandom, there is no basis to assume he would be inclined to do this. The question stem also does not mention anything about the fan wanting a selfie.\n\n3. The question stem does describe a real incident of a fan running onto the field and disrupting the game until being detained by security. However, it does not state the fan's motive was to get a selfie. It's quite possible he had other reasons. \n\n4. Comparing (a) and (b), neither scenario can be deemed likely based on the given information alone. However, (b) makes an additional unwarranted assumption about the motive being to get a selfie. This makes (b) even less supported than (a).\n\nTherefore, while neither scenario is likely, with (b) being even less so due to the extra unsupported detail.

The boy, scared by the threat, ran away.\n\nBased on these events, we can infer the following:\n\n4. The protagonist was offended and angered by the boy's racist remarks, leading to the confrontation.\n5. The boy's reaction of running away suggests that he was intimidated by the protagonist's threat and presence.\n6. Since the boy has already run away and the immediate confrontation has ended, it is unlikely that the protagonist would pursue the boy further.\n\nTherefore, considering the context and the sequence of events, option (a) is more likely: The protagonist might continue riding their bike without chasing the boy. The protagonist has already made their point, and the boy has fled, so there is little reason to escalate the situation by pursuing him.",

While it's possible that Don might enjoy compliments on his new boots, the information provided doesn't support the idea that receiving compliments from friends was his primary reason for wearing them.\n\nTherefore, choice (a) is more likely: Don would simply show off his new boots, without the specific intention of receiving compliments from friends. The passage doesn't provide evidence to suggest that seeking compliments was his main motivation.",

The question asks which is more likely: (a) Tracy continuing to walk on the beach, or (b) Tracy continuing to walk on the beach specifically so that the tie used in the repair would hold better under the stress of walking on sand.\n\nThe issue with option (b) is that it assumes Tracy's purpose for continuing to walk on the beach is to test or strengthen the repair on her flip-flop. However, there is no information in the passage to support this assumption. \n\nIt's more reasonable to assume that Tracy would simply continue walking on the beach because her flip-flop was fixed and she can resume her activity (option a). The passage does not provide any indication that Tracy would deliberately continue walking to stress-test the repair.\n\nTherefore, option (a) is more likely based on the information provided, and the reasoning in option (b) is not logically sound.",

While it is possible that Fred might want to impress his boss, the primary reason presented for Fred working late is that his boss made him stay to complete the project, not because Fred was seeking a promotion.\n\nStep 3: Compare the likelihood of options (a) and (b)\nBased on the given information, option (a) is more directly supported by the context. The question states that Fred wanted to finish the project so he could go home, but his boss made him stay late. Option (b) introduces additional assumptions that are not clearly supported by the provided information.\n\nTherefore, option (a) is more likely than option (b) based on the given context.",

This suggests that open discussions about beliefs might be challenging initially.\n\nStep 3: Consider the family's eventual acceptance.\nThe passage states that it took some time for the family to come to terms with the protagonist's decision.

Identify the relevant information:\n   - Lilly was afraid of heights and fast movement.\n   - She rode a roller coaster despite her fears.\n   - She hated the experience and threw up immediately after.\n   - She vowed never to go on a roller coaster again.\n\n2. Compare the two statements:\n   (a) Lilly would avoid roller coasters in the future.\n   (b) Lilly would avoid roller coasters in the future so that she would not feel nauseous and scared again.\n\n   Both statements indicate that Lilly would avoid roller coasters in the future. However, statement (b) provides additional information about her motivation for avoiding them.\n\n3. Assess the likelihood of each statement:\n   - Statement (a) is likely true based on Lilly's vow to never go on a roller coaster again.\n   - Statement (b) is also likely true, as it provides a reason for her decision to avoid roller coasters. Her fear of heights, fast movement, and her negative experience of feeling nauseous and scared support this statement.\n\n4. Determine which statement is more likely:\n   While both statements are likely true, statement (b) provides more context and is more specific about Lilly's reasoning. It directly connects her decision to avoid roller coasters with her desire to prevent feeling nauseous and scared again, which aligns with the information provided in the scenario.\n\nTherefore, statement (b) \"Lilly would avoid roller coasters in the future so that she would not feel nauseous and scared again\" is more likely.",

When Cara returned, her parents were furious and grounded her for two months.\n\nNow, let's consider the two options:\n\n(a) Cara might apologize to her parents for sneaking out.\n- This shows that Cara acknowledges her mistake and feels remorseful for her actions.\n- An apology is a good first step in mending the relationship with her parents.\n\n(b) Cara might apologize to her parents for sneaking out so that they might consider reducing her grounding period.\n- This option also involves an apology, but with an ulterior motive.\n- Cara's primary goal, in this case, is to have her grounding period reduced.\n- While it's natural for Cara to want a shorter punishment, this option suggests that her apology might not be entirely sincere.\n\nConsidering the context and the options, option (a) is more likely. Here's why:\n- A sincere apology without expecting anything in return demonstrates genuine remorse and understanding of one's mistake.\n- Cara's parents are more likely to appreciate and value an honest apology rather than one that seems to have an ulterior motive.\n- While Cara's parents might eventually consider reducing her grounding period, it's more likely that they would do so in response to a sincere apology and improved behavior over time, rather than an immediate request for leniency.\n\nTherefore, option (a) \"Cara might apologize to her parents for sneaking out\" is more likely in this situation.",

Statement (b) makes an assumption about Kim's specific intentions, which are not supported by the given context.\n\nTherefore, the more likely statement is (a) Kim would likely prepare for the arrival of her baby.",
