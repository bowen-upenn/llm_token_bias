Option (b) adds the specific reason of catching up on schoolwork, which is a possibility but not necessarily the case based on the given information. The question only states that Shane was grounded by his parents, without mentioning anything about catching up on schoolwork. Therefore, option (a) is more likely as it aligns with the direct consequence of Shane's actions without introducing unsupported details.",
