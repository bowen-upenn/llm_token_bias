Since his car is smoking and making unusual noises, it probably needs to be towed to a repair shop for diagnosis and fixing. Calling a mechanic or roadside assistance to help locate the nearest shop and arrange towing is the most logical course of action given the car's condition.",

The key point is that Greg would likely get the remainder of the meal to go, which is sufficiently captured by option (a).",
