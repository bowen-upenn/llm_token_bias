The question presents two options:\n   (a) Sally seeking medical attention for her allergic reaction.\n   (b) Sally seeking medical attention for her allergic reaction so that she could ensure it would not interfere with her busy work schedule the next day.\n\n2. Option (b) is a conjunction of two events:\n   - Sally seeking medical attention for her allergic reaction, AND\n   - Sally doing so to ensure it won't interfere with her busy work schedule the next day.\n\n3. Option (a) is a single event:\n   - Sally seeking medical attention for her allergic reaction.\n\n4. According to the conjunction rule in probability, the probability of a conjunction of events (A and B) is always less than or equal to the probability of its individual constituents (A or B).\n\n5. Therefore, the probability of option (b) occurring can never be greater than the probability of option (a) occurring.\n\n6. The additional information about Sally's date with Eddie and her desire not to see him again is irrelevant to the probability of her seeking medical attention. This information can be ignored.\n\nSo, focusing solely on the probabilities and ignoring the extraneous information, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Sally would seek medical attention for her allergic reaction.\n\nThis single event is more likely than the conjunction presented in option (b).",
