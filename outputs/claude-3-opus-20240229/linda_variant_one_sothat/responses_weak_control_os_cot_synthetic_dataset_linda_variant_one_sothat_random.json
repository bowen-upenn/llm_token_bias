This provides a direct reason for him to end the date early or avoid further contact, as stated in option (a).\n\nAdding the additional condition about watering plants in option (b) makes it less likely, as it introduces an unsupported assumption.

Both (a) and (b) state that Sadie would comfort the crying boy after the bullies left. This seems likely given Sadie's caring actions to defend the boy. \n\n3.

Sadie comforting the boy she defended is probable, but asserting an additional unstated motive of wanting to borrow a pencil afterwards is an unwarranted assumption.\n\n5.

In this case, answer (a) is a constituent of answer (b). Therefore, the probability of (b) cannot be greater than the probability of (a).\n\n5.

Given Terence's interest in nature and the exceptionally beautiful sunset, it is reasonable to assume he would want to capture the moment, likely by photographing or sketching it (option a).\n\n4. However, option (b) adds an additional, less probable assumption - that Terence would use the photograph or sketch as a reference to knit a sweater. While not impossible, this is a much more specific and less likely scenario compared to simply capturing the moment for its own sake.\n\n5. The detail about knitting a sweater is an extra piece of information that is not directly supported by the background we have about Terence. It's a less probable leap given the context.\n\nTherefore, while both (a) and (b) include the likely action of Terence photographing or sketching the sunset, (b) is less probable due to the additional unsupported assumption about knitting a sweater.
