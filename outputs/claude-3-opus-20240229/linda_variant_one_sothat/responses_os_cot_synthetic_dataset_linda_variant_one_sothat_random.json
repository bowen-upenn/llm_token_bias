This is a reasonable assumption, as most people would pay a ticket they received to avoid further legal consequences.\n\n2. Statement (b) adds additional information, stating that Tom would pay the ticket so he could have dinner with his friends later that evening. While this is possible, it is not necessarily relevant to whether or not Tom would pay the ticket.\n\n3. The question asks which statement is more likely, not which is possible. \n\n4. Paying a ticket is a common response to receiving one, regardless of one's plans for the rest of the day. The additional information about Tom's dinner plans doesn't directly affect the likelihood of him paying the ticket.\n\n5. Therefore, statement (a) is more likely, as it focuses on the direct and probable consequence of receiving a ticket, without adding potentially irrelevant details.\n\nIn conclusion, statement (a), \"Tom would pay the ticket,\" is more likely than statement (b), based on the information provided and the common response to receiving a ticket.",

It's unlikely that his primary motivation for spending time with his child was to catch up on TV shows later.\n\nTherefore, option (a) is more likely than option (b) based on the given information.

This behavior indicates a lack of respect for Nancy's boundaries and feelings.\n\nStep 2: Consider the consequences of James's actions.\nNancy felt scared by James's stalking behavior and reported him to the school.

She felt loved when using the gift certificate.\n\nNow, let's compare the two statements:\n\n(a) Katherine would buy coffee at Starbucks using the gift certificate.\n- This statement directly follows the information given in the question.\n- Katherine's love for coffee, her excitement about the gift certificate, and her visit to the Starbucks drive-through all support this statement.\n\n(b) Katherine would buy coffee at Starbucks using the gift certificate so that she could watch the season finale of her favorite TV show later that evening.\n- While the first part of this statement (buying coffee at Starbucks using the gift certificate) is supported by the given information, the second part (watching the season finale of her favorite TV show) is not mentioned in the question.\n- There is no connection established between Katherine buying coffee and watching a TV show season finale.\n\nTherefore, statement (a) is more likely because it is directly supported by the information provided in the question, whereas statement (b) includes additional information that is not related to the given context.\n\nSo, is statement (a) more likely than statement (b)?

The family was very worried about the baby's survival, further emphasizing the seriousness of the situation.\n\n3. Thankfully, the baby survived and is now two years old. This suggests that the family would be extremely grateful and relieved that their granddaughter overcame the challenges associated with her premature birth.\n\n4. Option (a) states that the protagonist would likely celebrate their granddaughter's second birthday. Given the context of the baby's premature birth and the family's concerns about her survival, it is highly likely that they would want to celebrate this milestone birthday as a testament to her resilience and the family's joy.\n\n5. Option (b) adds an additional detail about discussing plans for an upcoming vacation during the birthday celebration. While it's possible that the family might discuss vacation plans, the main focus of the celebration would likely be on the granddaughter's health and survival.\n\nTherefore, option (a) is more likely than option (b).

Option (a) states that Tony would attend a music concert. This aligns perfectly with his passion for music and his career as a music producer. Attending concerts would be a natural activity for someone with Tony's background and interests.\n\n3. Option (b) suggests that Tony would attend a music concert to review the latest smartphone models being used by concertgoers.

Additionally, the primary reason given for attending the concert in this option is to review smartphones, not to enjoy the music itself.\n\n4. Comparing the two options, option (a) is far more likely based on the information provided in the passage.

The protagonist made an insensitive comment about the weight of a woman in a picture, not realizing it was the same woman showing the album before she had surgery.\n\nNow, let's analyze the two given options:\n\n(a) The protagonist would likely apologize to the woman.\n- Given the social context, it is customary and polite to apologize when making an insensitive or hurtful comment, especially to someone you've just met.\n- Apologizing shows remorse and acknowledges the mistake, which can help maintain a cordial relationship with the new couple.\n\n(b) The protagonist would likely apologize to the woman so that she can tell him more about the photographer who took the pictures.\n- While apologizing is still a likely action, the reason given for the apology (to learn more about the photographer) seems irrelevant to the situation at hand.\n- The protagonist's primary concern would be to address the insensitive comment and express regret, rather than using the apology as a means to gain more information about the photographer.\n\nComparing the two options, scenario (a) is more likely because it directly addresses the social faux pas and follows common social etiquette.

After work, Melissa's friend called to inform her that he couldn't go to the movies because he had caught the flu. This shows that he is unwell and needs rest.\n\n4. Option (a) suggests that Melissa would visit her friend with soup and medicine, demonstrating her concern for his well-being and her desire to help him feel better. This aligns with the care and appreciation typically shown in a close friendship.\n\n5. Option (b) also suggests that Melissa would visit her friend with soup and medicine, but adds an ulterior motive of borrowing his vintage comic book collection. While it's possible that Melissa is interested in the comic books, the primary focus should be on her friend's health and well-being, given their close relationship.\n\nBased on the analysis, option (a) is more likely. Melissa's actions would likely be driven by genuine concern for her best friend's health, rather than a desire to borrow his comic books. The added motive in option (b) seems less probable given the circumstances and the nature of their friendship.",

Oki returned to Idaho and found love and understanding, like he always had.\n\nStep 1: Analyze statement (a)\nStatement (a) suggests that Oki would continue to embrace his life and relationships in Idaho. This aligns with the information provided, as Oki found love and understanding in Idaho, where he was raised. The statement does not introduce any new or unrelated information.\n\nStep 2: Analyze statement (b)\nStatement (b) also suggests that Oki would continue to embrace his life and relationships in Idaho, but it adds an additional reason: \"so that he could improve his skills in snowboarding during the winter season.\" While this statement is plausible, it introduces new information that is not directly supported by the given context.

Choosing dinner would be considered a privilege.\n\n3. Since Cara is grounded for two months, it's highly unlikely her parents would let her choose dinner the very next day, even if she apologizes. That would undermine the punishment they have given.\n\n4. Cara apologizing to her parents is a reasonable response to the situation, as she knows she did something wrong and upset them. An apology would be a good first step in repairing the relationship.\n\n5. However, expecting her parents to immediately grant her special privileges like choosing dinner right after the incident is not realistic. The apology should be given sincerely, not as a bargaining chip for perks.\n\nTherefore, (a) Cara might apologize to her parents for sneaking out is the more likely scenario compared to (b) Cara might apologize to her parents for sneaking out so that they might let her choose what to have for dinner the next day.",

The passage states that Jane went on a low calorie diet, and although it was difficult at first, her body adjusted over time.\n\n2. As a result of the diet, Jane became healthier and was in a better mood.\n\n3. The passage also mentions that Jane was glad her hard work paid off, implying that she found the results of her diet to be positive and rewarding.\n\n4. Statement (a) suggests that Jane would continue following her low calorie diet. This aligns with the information provided in the passage, as Jane experienced positive outcomes from her diet and was satisfied with the results.\n\n5. Statement (b) suggests that Jane would continue following her low calorie diet so that she could start collecting rare stamps. There is no information in the passage that relates Jane's diet to collecting rare stamps. This statement introduces an entirely new and unrelated idea.\n\nBased on the information provided in the passage, statement (a) is more likely to be true than statement (b). The passage supports the idea that Jane would continue her diet due to the positive results she experienced, while there is no evidence to suggest that her diet is related to collecting rare stamps.\n\nTherefore, the answer is Yes, statement (a) is more likely than statement (b).",

The protagonist traded shirts with their friend.\n\nNow, let's assess the likelihood of each statement:\n\n(a) The protagonist would likely wear a shirt that is too large for them.\n- Since the protagonist is larger than their friend and they traded shirts, it is likely that the shirt the protagonist received from their friend is too small for them.\n- Therefore, this statement is unlikely to be true.\n\n(b) The protagonist would likely wear a shirt that is too large for them so that they could enjoy the concert more comfortably.\n- There is no mention of a concert in the given information.\n- The statement introduces an additional assumption that is not supported by the provided context.\n- Therefore, this statement is also unlikely to be true.\n\nBased on the given information, neither statement (a) nor (b) is likely to be true. The protagonist most likely ended up with a shirt that is too small for them after trading with their smaller friend.",

Photographing or sketching the sunset would allow him to capture and document the beauty he observed, which is a common practice among naturalists.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate option (b).\n(b) Terence would likely photograph or sketch the sunset so that he could later use the image as a reference to knit a sweater.\nWhile it's possible that Terence enjoys knitting as a hobby, there is no information provided to support this assumption. Additionally, using a sunset image as a reference for knitting a sweater is not a common practice and seems less likely given Terence's profession as a naturalist.\n\nStep 4: Compare the likelihood of options (a) and (b).\nBased on the information provided and Terence's interests as a naturalist, option (a) appears to be more likely than option (b). Photographing or sketching the sunset directly relates to his appreciation for nature's beauty, while using the image to knit a sweater seems less probable and unrelated to his profession.\n\nTherefore, option (a) is more likely: Terence would likely photograph or sketch the sunset.",

They went on a date and discovered shared interests beyond singing.\n3. Their relationship progressed, leading to moving in together.\n4. Evan and April got married, which was expected by those who knew them.\n\nNow, let's assess the likelihood of the two given scenarios:\n\n(a) Celebrating an anniversary or organizing a family gathering:\n- Given that Evan and April are married, it is very common for couples to celebrate their wedding anniversary.\n- As a married couple, it is also likely that they would organize family gatherings, especially if they have close relationships with their respective families.\n\n(b) Celebrating an anniversary or organizing a family gathering to adopt a new pet:\n- While it's possible for couples to adopt a pet together, it is not as common or as directly related to being married as celebrating an anniversary or organizing family gatherings.\n- The passage does not mention anything about Evan and April's interest in pets, so there is no strong evidence to support this scenario.\n\nTherefore, scenario (a) is more likely than scenario (b) based on the information provided in the passage. Celebrating an anniversary and organizing family gatherings are more directly related to and expected of a married couple, while adopting a pet together is less common and not mentioned in the context of their relationship.",

Zack now refuses to drive his car in the winter, suggesting that he wants to protect his car from future accidents.\n\n4. Given his love for the car and his desire to protect it, it is more likely that Zack would repair or restore his car for his own satisfaction and to be able to drive it again, rather than to impress someone who isn't even aware of the accident.\n\n5. Trying to impress someone who doesn't know about the accident with a repaired car seems less likely, as it doesn't address Zack's primary concerns: his emotional attachment to the car and his desire to protect it from further damage.\n\nTherefore, option (a) is more likely than option (b).",

The key relevant facts are:\n   - Tom was invited to dinner by his girlfriend to meet her family.\n   - Tom didn't pay attention to the details and didn't dress up. \n   - Her family was surprisingly understanding about his lack of preparation.\n\n2. Given her family's understanding reaction, it's reasonable to assume Tom would feel relieved that they weren't upset with him.\n\n3. Since the dinner seems to be going well despite his initial unpreparedness, it's also reasonable to think he would enjoy the remainder of the dinner.\n\n4. The fact about remembering to water his plants when he gets home seems irrelevant to the question of whether he would feel relieved and enjoy the dinner. It's an extraneous detail that doesn't logically connect to his experience at the dinner or his emotional reaction to it.\n\n5. Therefore, choice (a) involving only his feeling of relief and enjoying the dinner is more likely, as it directly follows from the facts presented. Choice (b) adds an unlikely and unrelated element about watering plants, making it less probable.\n\nSo in conclusion, the answer is No - choice (b) is not more likely than choice (a).
