The question asks us to compare the probability of two events:\n   (a) Tom paying the ticket\n   (b) Tom paying the ticket AND having dinner with his friends later that evening\n\n2. We know from probability theory that the probability of a single event (A) is always greater than or equal to the probability of that event occurring in conjunction with another event (A and B). In other words, P(A) \u2265 P(A and B).\n\n3. In this case, event A is \"Tom paying the ticket\" and event B is \"Tom having dinner with his friends later that evening.\"\n\n4. The additional information about Tom's plans for dinner is irrelevant to the probability of him paying the ticket. It's an extra condition that only serves to reduce the probability.\n\n5. Therefore, without needing to know any more details, we can conclude that the probability of Tom paying the ticket (option a) is higher than the probability of Tom paying the ticket AND having dinner with his friends (option b).\n\nSo, the correct answer is (a) Tom would pay the ticket.

The question presents two options:\n   (a) Jackson writing more reports on subjects he enjoys\n   (b) Jackson writing more reports on subjects he enjoys AND learning to bake chocolate chip cookies\n\n2. The key difference between the options is that (a) involves a single event, while (b) involves a conjunction of two events - writing reports and learning to bake cookies.\n\n3. Probabilistically, the likelihood of a single event occurring is always greater than or equal to the likelihood of that event occurring in conjunction with another independent event.\n\n4. Writing enjoyable reports and learning to bake cookies are two separate, seemingly unrelated events. The occurrence of one does not necessarily imply the occurrence of the other.\n\n5.
