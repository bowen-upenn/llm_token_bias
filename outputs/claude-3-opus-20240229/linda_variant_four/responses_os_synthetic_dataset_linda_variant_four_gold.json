        "init_model_answer": "(a) The album won't chart in any country.\n\nExplanation: This question presents a common logical fallacy known as the conjunction fallacy. The conjunction fallacy occurs when we assume that the probability of two events occurring together (in \"conjunction\") is greater than the probability of either event occurring alone.\n\nIn this case, option (b) is a more specific scenario than option (a). For (b) to be true, not only must the album fail to chart, but the world tour must also sell out all major venues. Since (b) has these additional conditions, it is less likely than (a), which only requires that the album fails to chart.\n\nGiven The Rolling Stones' popularity and history of success, it is already unlikely that their new album would fail to chart in any country. Adding the requirement that their world tour sells out all major venues, despite the album's failure, makes the scenario even less probable.\n\nTherefore, (a) is more likely than (b), even though our intuition might initially lead us to believe otherwise.",
