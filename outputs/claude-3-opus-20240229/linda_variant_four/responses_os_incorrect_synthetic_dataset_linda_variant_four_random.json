Option (b) requires the movie to not only be a box office disaster but also receive critical acclaim for specific aspects. The additional conditions in (b) make it less probable than (a), even though it may seem more plausible due to the extra details.\n\nTherefore, based on probability, the correct answer is (a) - it is more likely that the movie is simply a box office disaster than being both a box office disaster and critically acclaimed for direction and storytelling.",

This is a more general statement that encompasses a wider range of possibilities for how the book will be received.\n\n(b) is more specific, stating that not only will the book not be a bestseller, but it will also be critically acclaimed. This adds an additional condition that narrows down the possible outcomes.\n\nSince (a) covers a broader set of potential outcomes and doesn't rely on the additional condition of critical acclaim, it is inherently more probable than (b). Therefore, if Ethan Samuel Johnson writes a new book next year, it is more likely that it will simply not make the bestseller list (a) than it is to not make the bestseller list and also be critically acclaimed (b).",

Gandhi was a strong proponent of such values throughout his life, and they formed the bedrock of his political and social activism. It is less probable that he would wholly endorse modern industrialism without tying it back to his fundamental beliefs.",

Option (b) makes a further claim that the event significantly strengthens their domestic support, despite lacking any international coverage. Without more context about Fernando & Mme Isabella's stature, the nature of the event, or the domestic political situation, there's no strong reason to assume the event would have a major impact on their domestic standing, especially if it garners no international attention at all. So the simpler scenario of (a), the event simply not being internationally newsworthy, seems more probable given the limited information available.",

Option (a) only states that the movie will win no awards, while (b) adds the additional condition that it must also become a box office hit.\n\nLogically, the probability of two independent events both occurring (the movie winning no awards AND becoming a box office hit) is always less than or equal to the probability of either one of those events occurring alone.\n\nSo the movie winning no awards is more likely than the movie winning no awards and also becoming a box office hit.

Adapting to these new realities and grasping the intricate web of modern geopolitics would be a significant challenge, even for someone with his expertise and experience.

Since Alexei Krushchev is a fictional person, the unlikely but highly specific and memorable shoe-banging detail makes option (b) a more likely hypothetical scenario in a speech than (a), even though (a) by itself would normally be far more probable.",

Such a book could become popular and sell well due to the novelty and alternative viewpoint it presents. \n\nHowever, Western political scholars and commentators would also be more likely to critically analyze and challenge the arguments and conclusions of a bestselling book that presents political ideas substantially different from established Western theories and ideologies. The book's popularity could actually make it a bigger target for criticism.\n\nSo while the book from an Iranian author could certainly become a bestseller in the US market, it being heavily criticized by Western scholars seems a probable companion scenario to its bestseller status. Just being a bestseller alone, without the criticism, appears relatively less likely given the contextual factors around the author and subject matter.",
