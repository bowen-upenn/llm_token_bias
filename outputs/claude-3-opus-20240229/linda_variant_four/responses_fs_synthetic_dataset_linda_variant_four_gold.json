Realistically, poor album performance would likely dampen ticket sales.\n\nSo between the two options, (a) is more probable, though still fairly unlikely in an absolute sense for a band as iconic as The Rolling Stones.

Option (b) contains additional specific details (heavy criticism by Western scholars) in conjunction with the book being a bestseller in the USA. The added details in (b) make that joint scenario less probable than (a) which just states the book becoming a bestseller in the USA.\n\nIn these types of comparative probability questions, the option that provides more specific details or conditions will generally be less likely than the option stating a single, more general outcome. Adding extra details narrows down the possibilities and reduces the overall likelihood compared to a simpler scenario.",

Deng Xiaoping (\u9093\u5c0f\u5e73), the renowned Chinese leader who introduced market reforms in China, passed away in 1997. Therefore, he cannot be advising on China's economic policies in 2023.\n\nGiven this context, neither option (a) nor option (b) is possible since Deng Xiaoping is no longer alive. If the question were rephrased to refer to a current Chinese leader or policymaker, it could be answered based on the likelihood of the given scenarios.",

        "init_model_answer": "The correct answer is (a) He compromises his legal principles.\n\nThe conjunction fallacy is at play here. Option (b) is more specific than option (a) - it's option (a) with additional details added. As a general rule, more specific scenarios are less probable than more general ones that they encompass.\n\nSo even if compromising his principles but ultimately upholding the law seems like it would fit Sirica's character, from a probability standpoint, the additional specificity makes it less likely than the more general option (a). It can't be more probable that he both compromises his principles AND upholds the law than that he simply compromises his principles.",
