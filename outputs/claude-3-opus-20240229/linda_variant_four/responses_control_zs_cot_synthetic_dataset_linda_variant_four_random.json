Let's assign this a probability of 0.3 (30%).\n\nStep 2: Consider the probability of option (b) - Brian performs his own stunts AND receives critical acclaim.\n- This is a conjunction of two events: performing his own stunts and receiving critical acclaim.\n- Per the rules of probability, P(A and B) \u2264 P(A) and P(B).
