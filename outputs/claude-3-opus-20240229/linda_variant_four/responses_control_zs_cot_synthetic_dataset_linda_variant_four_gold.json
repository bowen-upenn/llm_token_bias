First, note that both options contain the exact same first clause: \"He would not understand modern political issues.\" The difference lies in the additional clause in option (b).\n\n2. From a probability perspective, option (a) is a single event, while option (b) is a conjunction of two events: (1) not understanding modern issues AND (2) gaining a significant following.\n\n3. The fundamental rule of probability states that the probability of a conjunction (A and B) is always less than or equal to the probability of its individual components (A or B alone).\n\n4.

Let's approach this step-by-step while being mindful of the conjunction fallacy:\n\n(a) The event receives no international media coverage.\n(b) The event receives no international media coverage AND significantly strengthens their domestic support.\n\nKey Observations:\n1. Option (b) contains two conditions: no international media coverage AND strengthening domestic support. This is a conjunction of two events.\n2. Option (a) contains only one condition: no international media coverage. This is a single event.\n\nProbabilistic Reasoning:\n- The probability of a conjunction (two events occurring together) is always less than or equal to the probability of its individual constituents.\n- Mathematically, P(A and B) \u2264 P(A) and P(A and B) \u2264 P(B), where A and B are two events.\n- Therefore, the probability of (b) cannot exceed the probability of (a).\n\nAnswer:\nFollowing probabilistic reasoning and avoiding the conjunction fallacy, (a) is more likely than (b). The probability of the event receiving no international coverage is greater than or equal to the probability of it receiving no international coverage AND significantly strengthening domestic support.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) The event receives no international media coverage.",

Let's call this event M&S.\n\n(2) The key insight is that event (b) is a conjunction of two events: the podcast receiving mediocre reviews (M) AND the podcast gaining millions of subscribers (S). \n\n(3) From probability theory, we know that the probability of a conjunction (M&S) is always less than or equal to the probability of its individual events (M or S).

It is more likely that the podcast receives mediocre reviews than it is to receive mediocre reviews and gain millions of subscribers.\n\nThis problem illustrates the conjunction fallacy.
