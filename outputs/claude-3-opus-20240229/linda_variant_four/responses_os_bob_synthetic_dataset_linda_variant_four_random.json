These principles were central to his approach in the Indian independence movement against British rule. Given his strong commitment to these values, it is highly unlikely that Gandhi would resort to aggressive and derogatory language in a political debate, even in a modern context.\n\nHowever, Gandhi's ability to inspire millions of people to adopt his philosophy of non-violent resistance, despite any potential use of aggressive language, aligns with his historical impact.

Given that Ethan Affleck is directing a new superhero movie, is it more likely that (a) the movie is a box office disaster, or (b) the movie is both a box office disaster and receives critical acclaim?\n\nOption (b) is a subset of option (a). All movies that are box office disasters but receive critical acclaim are necessarily box office disasters. However, not all box office disasters receive critical acclaim.\n\nProbability(a) = Probability(box office disaster)\nProbability(b) = Probability(box office disaster AND critical acclaim)\n\nSince Probability(b) has the additional constraint of critical acclaim, it will always be less than or equal to Probability(a).\n\nTherefore, absent any other information, the movie being a box office disaster is more likely than it being a box office disaster that also receives critical acclaim.",

Option (b) is a more specific scenario that includes the condition of the movie becoming a box office hit despite not winning any awards. \n\nSince (a) doesn't specify anything about the movie's commercial success, it includes both the possibilities of the movie being a box office hit or not. On the other hand, (b) only considers the case where the movie is a commercial success without winning awards, which is a subset of the possibilities covered by (a).\n\nTherefore, (a) is more likely as it covers a broader range of outcomes compared to the more specific scenario described in (b).",
