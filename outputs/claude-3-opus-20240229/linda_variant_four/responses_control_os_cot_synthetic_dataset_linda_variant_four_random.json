Option (a) represents a single event - Maria not winning the prize.\n\n3. Option (b) represents a conjunction of two events:\n   - Event 1: Maria not winning the prize.\n   - Event 2: Maria being celebrated worldwide for her democratic efforts in the Philippines.\n\n4. According to the basic probability rule, the probability of a conjunction (two events occurring together) is always less than or equal to the probability of either of the individual events.\n\n5. Therefore, the probability of Maria not winning the prize (option a) is greater than or equal to the probability of Maria not winning the prize AND being celebrated worldwide (option b).\n\nThus, the correct answer is (a) She doesn't win. This is more likely than the conjunction of her not winning and being celebrated worldwide.",

No other information about Dr. Ho or his track record in vaccine development is provided.\n\n2. Option (a) states that the vaccine fails in initial trials. This is a single event.\n\n3. Option (b) states that the vaccine fails in initial trials AND eventually becomes the leading vaccine to combat the pandemic after further development. This is a conjunction of two events - the vaccine failing initial trials, and then going on to become the leading vaccine after more work.\n\n4. Basic probability tells us that the probability of a single event (A) is always greater than or equal to the probability of that event (A) in conjunction with another event (B). In mathematical terms, P(A) \u2265 P(A and B).\n\n5. Therefore, without any additional information to suggest otherwise, the probability of the vaccine simply failing initial trials (option a) must be greater than or equal to the probability of it failing initial trials and then becoming the leading vaccine (option b).\n\nSo, the correct answer is (a) - it is more likely that the vaccine fails in initial trials, as compared to it failing initial trials and then becoming the leading vaccine.\n\nThis question is designed to test the conjunction fallacy, where people often misjudge the likelihood of two events occurring together as being more probable than a single event. It's important to remember basic probability rules and not be swayed by the narrative or representativeness of the events.",
