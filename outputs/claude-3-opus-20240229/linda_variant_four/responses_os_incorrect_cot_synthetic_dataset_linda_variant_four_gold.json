This is a given fact for the sake of the question.\n\n2. Option (a) states that the album won't chart in any country. This is a possibility, as not all albums are guaranteed to chart, even for a well-known band like The Rolling Stones.\n\n3. Option (b) states that the album won't chart in any country, but their world tour sells out all the major venues. This scenario is less likely than option (a) for the following reasons:\n   - If an album by a popular band like The Rolling Stones doesn't chart in any country, it suggests that the album is not well-received or popular among fans.\n   - If an album is not popular, it is unlikely that the band's world tour would sell out all the major venues, as the tour's success is usually tied to the popularity of the band's recent work.\n\n4. Therefore, option (a) is more likely than option (b). If the album doesn't chart, it is more probable that the world tour would also face challenges in selling out major venues.\n\nIn conclusion, option (a) is more likely than option (b), making the given question logically unsound.",

If FDR were resurrected for one day, it seems unlikely that he would decide not to give any speech at all. As a former president known for his leadership and communication skills, he would likely want to take the opportunity to address the nation, even if only briefly. So option (a) seems less probable.\n\n2. Now, let's consider option (b). Even if FDR decided not to give a formal speech, his mere presence would undoubtedly generate enormous public interest. People would be curious to see and hear from such a prominent historical figure, especially one who led the country through significant challenges like the Great Depression and World War II.\n\n3. FDR's return would likely spark renewed interest in his policies and decisions during his presidency, and how they have shaped modern American politics and society. People would be eager to learn more about his legacy and draw comparisons to current political issues and leaders.\n\n4. The media coverage and public discourse surrounding FDR's resurrection would be extensive, further amplifying the impact of his presence on public interest in historical political decisions and their relevance today.\n\n5.

Scenario (b) suggests that despite a low turnout for the first concert, they manage to sell out multiple stadiums later in the tour. This implies that:\n   - Word of mouth spreads about the quality of the shows\n   - The group and/or organizers make adjustments to improve ticket sales (e.g., better promotion, more accessible venues, more convenient dates)\n   - Fans become more engaged as the tour progresses\n\n5. Given the Spice Girls' existing popularity and fan base, it seems more likely that they would be able to sell out multiple stadiums during the tour, even if the first concert has low attendance due to unforeseen circumstances or poor planning.\n\nTherefore, scenario (b) appears more likely: The first concert has low audience turnout, but they sell out multiple stadiums later in the tour.",

Every case where (b) happens is also a case where (a) happens, but not vice versa. There can be cases where she doesn't win the prize but also isn't celebrated worldwide.\n\n3) A basic rule of probability is that the probability of an event A occurring can never be less than the probability of events A and B both occurring, where B is some other event.

However, even if the special receives poor reviews, it could still break viewership records due to Seinfeld's popularity and the anticipation around his comeback.

The probability of this happening is the product of the individual probabilities of each event.\n\n4. On the other hand, the probability of the special simply receiving poor reviews is higher than the probability of it receiving poor reviews and breaking viewership records. This is because the latter scenario has an additional condition (breaking records) that needs to be met.\n\nTherefore, option (a) is more likely than option (b). It is more probable that the special receives poor reviews than it is to receive poor reviews and also break viewership records.\n\nThe correct answer is Yes, (a) is more likely than (b).",

Current political climate:\n   - The Democratic Party has shifted to the left on various issues since Johnson's presidency.\n   - There is a growing progressive wing within the party, advocating for policies such as Medicare for All, free college education, and more aggressive action on climate change.\n   - However, there is also a moderate wing that favors more incremental changes and bipartisan cooperation.\n\n3. Media attention and influence:\n   - As a former president, Johnson would likely attract significant media attention if he were to run for office today.\n   - His experience and historical significance would make him a newsworthy figure, regardless of his performance in the primaries.\n   - He could potentially use this platform to influence policy discussions and shape the national conversation.\n\n4.

The Rolling Stones are an extremely well-known and successful band with a long history of releasing popular albums and songs. This makes it unlikely that a new album from them would not chart anywhere at all.\n\n2. Even if the album as a whole doesn't perform as well as their past albums, The Rolling Stones are known for their hit singles. They have a track record of producing songs that become very popular.\n\n3. In the modern music industry, a song can become a \"viral hit\" through heavy streaming and sharing on social media platforms, even if the album itself is not purchased or streamed as much. This gives an individual song the potential to take off separately from the album.\n\n4. However, for an album to not chart anywhere would suggest a complete lack of interest or promotion, which seems very unlikely for a new release from a band as famous as The Rolling Stones.\n\n5. Therefore, while a viral hit song from an otherwise underperforming album is possible, it seems more likely that a new Rolling Stones album would chart at least somewhere, even if it doesn't reach number one.\n\nSo, to explicitly answer the question:\n\nNo, option (b) is not more likely than option (a).

Rowling.\n- Her writing skills, storytelling ability, and past success reduce the likelihood of harsh criticism.\n\nStep 4: Analyze scenario (b)\n- Scenario (b) includes scenario (a) as a prerequisite, which makes it a subset of scenario (a).\n- For scenario (b) to occur, the book must first receive harsh initial criticism, and then go on to become a bestseller within a year.\n- The probability of both events occurring together is lower than the probability of just one event (harsh initial criticism) occurring.\n\nStep 5: Compare the likelihood of scenarios (a) and (b)\n- Since scenario (b) requires two events to occur, it is less likely than scenario (a), which only requires one event.\n- Therefore, scenario (a) is more likely than scenario (b).\n\nIn conclusion, scenario (a), where the book receives harsh initial criticism, is more likely than scenario (b), where the book receives harsh initial criticism but becomes a bestseller within a year.",

The question assumes that the company will fail within the first year in both scenarios, which is not necessarily true.

He understood the need for economic development and self-sufficiency for India.

Kamala Harris is the current vice president, which gives her high name recognition and a strong political profile. This could be advantageous in a presidential primary.\n\n2. However, incumbent vice presidents do not have a strong track record of winning when they run for president. Examples include Al Gore in 2000 and Hubert Humphrey in 1968, both of whom won their party's nomination but lost the general election.\n\n3. If Harris loses in the primary elections, it would suggest that the Democratic party and its voters prefer a different candidate to be their presidential nominee.\n\n4. Historically, it is unusual (though not unprecedented) for a vice presidential candidate to be chosen again after losing a presidential primary. Most presidential nominees select a new running mate.\n\n5. The selection of the vice presidential candidate is typically based on various factors like balancing the ticket, appealing to key demographics, and strategic considerations for winning the general election. The primary performance of the potential VP pick is not usually a major factor.\n\nTherefore, scenario (a), \"Kamala Harris will lose in the primary elections\", is more likely than scenario (b), \"Kamala Harris will lose in the primary elections but be chosen as the vice-presidential candidate again.\"\n\nThe likelihood of a defeated primary candidate being chosen again as VP is low, based on historical precedent and the typical VP selection process.",

The two events being compared are:\n   (a) Khrushchev receiving a standing ovation from everyone present.\n   (b) Khrushchev receiving a standing ovation from everyone, and then banging his shoe on the table.\n\n2. Event (b) is a more specific version of event (a). It includes everything in (a), plus an additional action.\n\n3. A more specific event is always less likely or at most equally likely compared to a more general event that encompasses it.\n\n4. Therefore, the probability of (b) cannot be greater than the probability of (a).\n\n5. The question states that (b) is more likely than (a), but this contradicts the logic principle we established in steps 3 and 4.\n\nTherefore, the claim that event (b) is more likely than event (a) is not logically sound.",

Ayatullah Khomeini was the Supreme Leader of Iran from 1979 until his death in 1989. He was a prominent figure in the Islamic Revolution and is known for his strict religious and political views, which often conflicted with Western ideologies.\n\n2. Given Khomeini's background and the nature of his political philosophy, it is likely that his book would contain views that are at odds with mainstream Western political thought.\n\n3. The USA has a predominantly Western culture and political system. Books that become bestsellers in the USA often align with or appeal to Western perspectives.\n\n4. However, controversial or provocative books can also become bestsellers due to the attention and discourse they generate.\n\n5. If Khomeini's book were to become a bestseller in the USA, it would likely be due to its controversial nature rather than widespread agreement with its content.\n\n6. Western scholars would be likely to critically analyze and respond to the book, especially if it gains significant attention or popularity.\n\nTherefore, scenario (b) is more likely: The book becomes a bestseller in the USA but is heavily criticized by Western scholars. The book's success would likely be due to its controversial nature and the discourse it generates rather than broad acceptance of its ideas in American society.",

At best, they could be equally likely if compromising his principles always leads to still upholding the legal process. But (a) would be more likely if there are any instances where compromising his principles does not lead to upholding the integrity of the legal process.\n\nThe question is poorly constructed as the two choices are not mutually exclusive or equally specific.
