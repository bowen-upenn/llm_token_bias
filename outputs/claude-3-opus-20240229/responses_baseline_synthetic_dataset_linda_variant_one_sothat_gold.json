However, option (b) adds an additional assumption about Tom's motivation for paying the ticket (i.e., to continue using his new car stereo without further issues). Since this motivation is not explicitly stated in the original text, it is an unsupported assumption.\n\nIn contrast, option (a) simply states that Tom would pay the ticket, which is a reasonable and likely outcome given that he was caught breaking the law and issued a ticket. Without additional information, it is more prudent to choose the option that does not make unwarranted assumptions.",

Her experience on the ride, which made her feel sick and caused her to throw up immediately after, would have reinforced and intensified her pre-existing fears. Her vow to never go on a roller coaster again suggests that she wants to avoid not just the roller coaster itself, but also the negative physical sensations (nausea) and emotional responses (fear) that she associated with the experience.\n\nWhile option (a) is also plausible given Lilly's reaction, it does not capture her motivations for avoiding roller coasters as clearly as option (b) does.",
