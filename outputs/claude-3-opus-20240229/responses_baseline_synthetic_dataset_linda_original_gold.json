        "init_model_answer": "Based on the information provided about Raj, I would say that option (b) is more probable:\n\n(b) Raj is a passenger vehicle driver and enjoys participating in hackathons and coding competitions.\n\nThe description of Raj highlights his strong passion for computer science, mathematics, and problem-solving. It also mentions that he enjoys coding personal projects and exploring different programming languages in his free time. Given these interests and skills, it is more likely that Raj would enjoy participating in hackathons and coding competitions, where he can apply his knowledge and challenge himself alongside other programmers.\n\nWhile it is possible that Raj is a passenger vehicle driver (option a), this information is not directly related to or supported by the details provided about his background and interests. Therefore, the additional information in option (b) about his probable enjoyment of hackathons and coding competitions makes it the more likely scenario.",
