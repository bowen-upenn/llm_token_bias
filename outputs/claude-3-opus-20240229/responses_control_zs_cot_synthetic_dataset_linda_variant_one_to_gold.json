The question is asking us to compare the likelihood of two events:\n   (a) Jordan continuing to wear the new pair of pants in general\n   (b) Jordan continuing to wear the new pair of pants specifically to work\n\n2. Event (a) is a more general statement, while event (b) is a more specific instance of event (a). Wearing the pants to work is a subset of wearing the pants in general.\n\n3. According to probability theory, the probability of a specific event (wearing pants to work) cannot be higher than the probability of a more general event that includes it (wearing pants in general). \n\n   In mathematical terms: P(A and B) \u2264 P(A), where A is \"wearing pants\" and B is \"to work\".\n\n4. Therefore, without any additional information, it is always at least as likely, if not more likely, that Jordan would continue wearing the new pair of pants in general (event a) compared to him wearing them specifically to work (event b).\n\nSo, the correct answer is (a) Jordan would continue wearing the new pair of pants.\n\nThis question is an example of the conjunction fallacy, where people often misjudge a more specific scenario as more likely than a general one. By abstracting the problem and applying basic probability rules, we can avoid this fallacy and arrive at the correct answer.",

The question asks us to compare the likelihood of two events:\n   (a) The protagonist striving to recover from the ankle injury.\n   (b) The protagonist striving to recover from the ankle injury to help his team in upcoming games.\n\n2. Event (b) is a more specific version of event (a). It includes all the conditions of (a), with the additional condition of the motivation being to help his team in upcoming games.\n\n3. In probability theory, a more specific event is always less likely or at most equally likely compared to a more general event that includes it. This is because the specific event has all the constraints of the general event, plus additional constraints.\n\n4. Therefore, event (a) is necessarily more likely or at least as likely as event (b). The probability of (a) is greater than or equal to the probability of (b).\n\n5. The additional background information about Golden State's performance and the outcome of the finals is not directly relevant to the comparison of these two specific events.\n\nSo, using strict probabilistic reasoning and ignoring the narrative details, the correct answer is (a).

This is a single, standalone event.\n\n2. Option (b) states that the protagonist would likely visit another fair or carnival soon to ride more rides. This is a conjunction of two events: (i) visiting another fair or carnival soon, AND (ii) riding more rides at that fair or carnival.\n\n3. According to the laws of probability, the probability of a conjunction (two events occurring together) is always less than or equal to the probability of either of the individual events alone.\n\n4. Therefore, the probability of option (b) - visiting another fair or carnival soon AND riding more rides - cannot be greater than the probability of option (a) - simply visiting another fair or carnival soon.\n\n5. The background information about the protagonist enjoying the fair, the rides, the games, and the food is not directly relevant to the probability comparison. It may suggest a likelihood of the protagonist wanting to visit a fair again, but it doesn't change the fundamental probability rule that a single event is more likely than a conjunction of events.\n\nSo, based on probabilistic reasoning and ignoring the narrative details, the correct answer is (a). The protagonist is more likely to visit another fair or carnival soon, compared to visiting another fair or carnival soon specifically to ride more rides.",

Option (a) is a single event: Christian watching Netflix on his new tablet. This is quite probable given that his friends do this and he felt left out, prompting him to buy a new tablet.\n\n4. Option (b) is a conjunction of two events: Christian watching Netflix on his new tablet AND doing so to catch up with the latest TV shows and movies. While the first part (watching Netflix) is the same as option (a), the second part (his motivation being to catch up on shows and movies) is an additional condition that makes this option less probable.\n\n5.

In those types of problems, one option contains a single probabilistic event while the other option contains that same event plus an additional one, making it a subset of the first. Choosing the second option is fallacious because the probability of two events both occurring is always less than or equal to the probability of either event alone.\n\nIn this case, both options (a) and (b) contain the same core event - Tom calling security or the police. Option (b) just provides additional context for WHY he would do that (to ensure staff safety). It does not introduce an additional probabilistic event that would make (b) less likely than (a).\n\nSince both options are equivalent from a probabilistic standpoint, to answer the question of which is more likely, we need to reason based on the situational details provided. \n\nThe key facts are:\n1) Tom fired an unstable, combative employee\n2) The employee returned on Monday, presumably angry about being fired\n\nGiven the employee's history of getting into fights and stirring up trouble, combined with the implied anger over the firing, it's reasonable to infer the returned employee may pose a safety risk. This makes option (b) a rational choice for Tom to prioritize the security of his staff.\n\nWhile either option is possible, based on the context, I believe (b) is more likely - that Tom would call security/police specifically to ensure staff safety from the disgruntled former employee.
