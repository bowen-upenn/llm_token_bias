Let's call this event B and denote its probability as P(B).\n\nSo option (b) represents the probability of both A and B occurring, which we write as P(A and B).\n\nNow, a fundamental rule of probability states that the probability of a conjunction P(A and B) is always less than or equal to the probability of its individual constituents.
