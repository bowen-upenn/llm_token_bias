Common symptoms include abdominal pain and tenderness, nausea, vomiting, fever, and jaundice.\n\n2) Swelling of the stomach (also known as ascites) is another common symptom of alcoholic hepatitis. It occurs due to fluid buildup in the abdomen as the liver fails to function properly.\n\n3) Option (a) includes two conditions: swelling of the stomach AND abdominal pain. Option (b) includes only one condition: swelling of the stomach.\n\n4) The probability of two events occurring together (intersection) is always less than or equal to the probability of either one occurring alone. In other words, P(A and B) \u2264 P(A) and P(A and B) \u2264 P(B).\n\n5) Therefore, the probability of Judy experiencing both swelling of the stomach and abdominal pain (option a) is less than or equal to the probability of her experiencing just swelling of the stomach (option b).\n\nSo, based on the principle of conjunction probability, the correct answer is:\n\n(b) She experiences swelling of the stomach.\n\nThe conjunction fallacy is the tendency to assume that specific conditions are more probable than a single general one. But in reality, the probability of two events occurring together is always less than or equal to the probability of either one occurring alone.",

        "init_model_answer": "Okay, let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1) Hypothyroidism is a condition where the thyroid gland doesn't produce enough thyroid hormones. This can lead to various symptoms.\n\n2) One of the common symptoms of hypothyroidism is sensitivity to cold, which can manifest as cold hands and feet. So option (a) is a likely scenario for Rohit.\n\n3) Brittle nails can also be a symptom of hypothyroidism, but it's less common compared to cold sensitivity.\n\n4) Option (b) is a combination of two conditions - cold hands and feet (which is common), and brittle nails (which is less common).\n\n5) In probability, the likelihood of two events occurring together (in \"and\" fashion) is always less than or equal to the probability of either one occurring alone. This is because for two events to occur together, each one has to occur individually as well.\n\n6) Therefore, the probability of Rohit experiencing both cold hands and feet and having brittle nails (option b) is always less than or equal to the probability of him experiencing just cold hands and feet (option a).\n\nSo, even though both (a) and (b) are possible given Rohit's condition, (a) is more likely than (b).\n\nTherefore, the answer is (a) - it is more likely that Rohit experiences cold hands and feet, rather than experiencing cold hands and feet and having brittle nails.\n\nThis is an example of the conjunction fallacy, where people tend to think that more specific conditions are more probable than a single general one, even though that's not the case in terms of probability.",
