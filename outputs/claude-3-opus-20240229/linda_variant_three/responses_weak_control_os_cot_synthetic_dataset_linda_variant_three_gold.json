However, at age 60, it is highly likely that Taylor has gone through menopause and no longer menstruates, regardless of gender identity.\n\n4) Therefore, while fatigue is a common symptom of hypothyroidism that Taylor is likely to experience, abnormal menstruation is not a symptom that a 60-year-old individual is likely to have, as menopause typically occurs between the ages of 45 and 55.\n\n5) Additionally, option (b) is fully contained within option (a). Fatigue by itself is more probable than fatigue AND another specific symptom occurring together.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is (b) Taylor experiences fatigue.
