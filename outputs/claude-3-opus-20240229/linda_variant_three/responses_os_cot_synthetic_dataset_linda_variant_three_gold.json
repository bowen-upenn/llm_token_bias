The fact that Pat is 57 years old or transgender doesn't have any direct bearing on the likelihood of specific Dengue symptoms.\n\n5. Given that malaise is a more general symptom and pain behind the eyes is a more specific symptom of Dengue, the probability of Pat experiencing both malaise and pain behind the eyes (option a) is likely to be lower than the probability of Pat experiencing just malaise (option b).\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the correct answer is (b) Pat also experiences malaise.",

A brain hemorrhage is bleeding in the brain, which can cause a variety of neurological symptoms depending on the location and severity of the bleed.\n\n2. Altered sensorium, which includes changes in mental status, consciousness, or responsiveness, is a common symptom of brain hemorrhage. This is because bleeding can compress or irritate the brain tissue, disrupting normal brain function.\n\n3. Headache is also a common symptom of brain hemorrhage, as the bleeding increases pressure within the skull. However, not all patients with brain hemorrhage experience headache.\n\n4. The question does not provide any additional information to suggest that Alex is more or less likely to experience headache compared to the typical presentation of brain hemorrhage.\n\n5. Therefore, while both altered sensorium and headache are possible symptoms, the presence of altered sensorium is more certain given the diagnosis of brain hemorrhage and paralysis.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is (b) They also experience altered sensorium. While Alex may also have a headache, the information provided more strongly suggests the presence of altered sensorium as a symptom accompanying the paralysis from the brain hemorrhage.",

The question is asking whether it's more likely for the man to experience only hip joint pain (b), or hip joint pain along with other joint pain (a).\n\n4.

When the bladder is infected, it can become inflamed and irritated, causing pain or discomfort.\n\n3) The feeling of needing to urinate continuously, even when the bladder is empty, is also a common symptom of a UTI. This is due to the inflammation and irritation in the bladder.\n\n4) Option (a) includes both bladder discomfort and the continuous feel of needing to urinate, which are two of the most common symptoms of a UTI.\n\n5) Option (b) only includes one of these common symptoms (bladder discomfort).\n\n6) Given that the woman has a confirmed UTI, it is more likely that she would experience multiple common symptoms rather than just one.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) She also experiences bladder discomfort and a continuous feel of urine.

The stomach acid can irritate the lining of the esophagus, causing inflammation and leading to vomiting.\n\n3. Ulcers on the tongue are not a typical symptom of GERD. While GERD can cause damage to the esophagus, it is less likely to directly cause ulcers on the tongue. Tongue ulcers are more often associated with other conditions, such as oral infections, nutritional deficiencies, or certain autoimmune disorders.\n\n4.
