The question gives us some demographic information about Pat (age, race, gender identity), as well as their hepatitis A diagnosis. However, this background information is not directly relevant to determining the likelihood of the given events. We need to focus solely on the probabilities.\n\n2. Option (a) states that Pat experiences both vomiting and yellowing of the eyes. This is a conjunction of two events - let's call them event A (vomiting) and event B (yellowing of the eyes).\n\n3. Option (b) states that Pat experiences vomiting. This is a single event, event A.\n\n4. A basic rule of probability states that the probability of a conjunction, P(A and B), is always less than or equal to the probability of its individual constituents, P(A) or P(B).\n\n5. Therefore, the probability that Pat experiences vomiting, P(A), will always be greater than or equal to the probability that Pat experiences both vomiting and yellowing of the eyes, P(A and B).\n\nSo, based on the rules of probability, the correct answer is:\n\n(b) Pat experiences vomiting.\n\nThe conjunction of vomiting and yellowing of the eyes cannot be more likely than vomiting alone, regardless of Pat's background characteristics.

The probability of Judy experiencing both \"swelling of the stomach\" and \"abdominal pain\" (option a) is always less than or equal to the probability of her experiencing just \"swelling of the stomach\" (option b).\n\nTherefore, based on the principles of probability, option (b) \"She experiences swelling of the stomach\" is more likely than option (a) \"She experiences swelling of the stomach and abdominal pain\".\n\nThe additional information about Judy's age and ethnicity is not relevant to the probabilistic analysis of the two options.",
