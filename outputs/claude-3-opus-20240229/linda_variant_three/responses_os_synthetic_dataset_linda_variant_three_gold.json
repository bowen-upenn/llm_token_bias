When blood sugar drops too low, the body releases hormones like adrenaline to raise blood sugar back up. The release of these hormones can lead to symptoms like shakiness, sweating, palpitations and anxiety.\n\nWhile palpitations alone are a possible symptom of hypoglycemia, the combination of palpitations and anxiety is a more common and likely presentation for someone experiencing low blood sugar.

The bleed often impacts one side of the body more than the other.\n\n(b) While headache commonly occurs with a brain bleed, it is not as consistently present as hemiparesis/weakness. Having both weakness and headache is certainly possible, but less probable than weakness alone.\n\nTherefore, based on the high likelihood of hemiparesis with paralysis from a brain hemorrhage, and the somewhat lower (though still common) occurrence of headache, I conclude that option (a) is more likely.",
