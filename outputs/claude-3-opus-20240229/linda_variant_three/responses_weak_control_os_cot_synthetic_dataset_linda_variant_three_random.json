A UTI is an infection in any part of the urinary system, which includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. The most common symptoms of a UTI are a strong, persistent urge to urinate, a burning sensation when urinating, and passing frequent, small amounts of urine.\n\n2. Now, let's look at option (a). Bladder discomfort is a common symptom of a UTI, as the infection often causes inflammation and irritation in the bladder. Insomnia, however, is not a typical symptom directly associated with UTIs.\n\n3. Option (b) only mentions bladder discomfort, which is a common symptom of a UTI.\n\n4. According to the conjunction rule in probability theory, the probability of two events occurring together (in \"conjunction\") is always less than or equal to the probability of either one occurring alone.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (b) She experiences bladder discomfort.
