Vomiting is one of the common symptoms of hepatitis A, as mentioned above.\n\n3. Jaundice, which is the yellowing of the skin and eyes, is also a common symptom of hepatitis A.

However, neck pain alone is not sufficient to diagnose osteoarthritis, as it can be caused by various other factors such as poor posture, muscle strain, or injury.\n\n3. Swelling in the joints is a more specific symptom of osteoarthritis. When the cartilage deteriorates, the body may respond by producing more synovial fluid, causing the joint to swell. This swelling, along with joint pain, is a common sign of osteoarthritis.\n\n4.

It often presents as the first symptom and can range from mild to severe.\n\n3) Yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice) occurs in Hepatitis C when the liver is significantly affected and unable to properly process bilirubin. While it is a characteristic sign of liver problems, it doesn't occur in all cases of Hepatitis C, especially in the early stages.\n\n4) Given that Robert was recently diagnosed, it's more likely that he is experiencing fatigue as an initial symptom. Jaundice usually occurs later as the liver becomes more affected.\n\nTherefore, based on the likelihood of symptoms in the given scenario, I select option (b): He experiences fatigue.",

Its common symptoms include high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pains, nausea, vomiting, swollen glands, and rash.\n\n2. Malaise, which is a general feeling of discomfort, weakness, or uneasiness, is also a common symptom of Dengue fever.\n\n3. Pain behind the eyes, medically known as retro-orbital pain, is a distinctive feature of Dengue fever. It is often described as a deep, aching pain that worsens with eye movement.\n\n4. While both malaise and pain behind the eyes are common symptoms of Dengue fever, malaise is a more general symptom that can be associated with many other illnesses as well.\n\n5. On the other hand, pain behind the eyes, especially in the context of other Dengue symptoms, is a more specific indicator of Dengue fever.\n\n6. However, the presence of malaise alone does not necessarily confirm Dengue fever, as it is a non-specific symptom.\n\n7. The likelihood of Pat experiencing both malaise and pain behind the eyes is higher than experiencing malaise alone, given the diagnosis of Dengue fever.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the typical presentation of Dengue fever, option (a) is more likely: Pat is more likely to experience both malaise and pain behind the eyes, rather than just malaise alone.",

Migraines are a neurological condition that can cause severe headaches, often accompanied by other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light and sound.\n\n3. While some people with migraines may experience changes in appetite, such as craving certain foods or losing appetite altogether, excessive hunger (polyphagia) is not a typical symptom directly associated with migraines.\n\n4. Excessive hunger, along with excessive thirst and frequent urination, is more commonly associated with conditions such as diabetes or hyperthyroidism.\n\n5. Acidity, or acid reflux, is a digestive issue where stomach acid flows back into the esophagus, causing discomfort and heartburn. It is not typically directly related to migraines.\n\n6.

Chest pain can occur due to the increased pressure on the heart, causing it to work harder to pump blood through the body.\n\n3. Dizziness, while a possible symptom of hypertension, is less common than chest pain. Dizziness may occur if hypertension causes a decrease in blood flow to the brain.\n\n4.

It can lead to health problems such as heart disease and stroke if not controlled.\n\n2. Common symptoms of hypertension include headaches, shortness of breath, dizziness, chest pain, and nosebleeds. However, many people with hypertension do not experience any symptoms.\n\n3. Lack of concentration can be a symptom of hypertension, especially if the blood pressure is extremely high. This is because high blood pressure can affect the blood flow to the brain, leading to cognitive issues.\n\n4. Loss of balance is not a typical symptom directly associated with hypertension. However, if hypertension leads to a stroke, it can cause balance problems and other neurological issues.\n\n5. Given that lack of concentration is a more common symptom of hypertension compared to loss of balance, it is more likely that Maria, who has been diagnosed with hypertension, would experience a lack of concentration rather than both a lack of concentration and loss of balance.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and the common symptoms of hypertension, option (b) \"She also experiences a lack of concentration\" is more likely.",

While both neck pain and weakness in limbs can occur in cervical spondylosis, neck pain is a more common and consistent symptom.\n\n4. Weakness in limbs occurs when there is additional pressure on the spinal cord or nerve roots, which is a more severe presentation of cervical spondylosis and is less common than isolated neck pain.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the typical presentation of cervical spondylosis, option (b) \"He experiences neck pain\" is more likely than option (a) \"He experiences neck pain and weakness in limbs.\"",

In rare cases, Hepatitis E can lead to acute liver failure, which may cause complications like coma or even death. However, this is more common in pregnant women and individuals with pre-existing liver disease.\n\n5. Given that the patient is a 50-year-old African American man with no mention of pre-existing liver conditions or other risk factors, it is more likely that he will experience the common symptoms of Hepatitis E, such as yellowing of the skin (jaundice), rather than developing severe complications like coma.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the typical progression of Hepatitis E, option (a) \"He experiences yellowish skin\" is more likely than option (b) \"He experiences yellowish skin and coma.\"",

Migraine and acidity (gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD): While there is some evidence suggesting a potential link between migraine and GERD, the association is not as well-established as the one between migraine and depression. Some studies have found a higher prevalence of GERD among migraineurs, but the causal relationship is unclear.\n\n3. Age and gender: John's age (59 years) and gender (male) do not significantly influence the likelihood of him experiencing depression or acidity in addition to migraine, as these conditions can affect people of all ages and genders.\n\n4. Ethnicity: John's ethnicity (white) also does not play a major role in determining the likelihood of him experiencing depression or acidity alongside migraine, as these conditions affect individuals across all ethnicities.\n\nGiven the strong, well-established link between migraine and depression and the relatively weaker association between migraine and acidity (GERD), it is more likely that:\n\n(b) John also experiences depression.\n\nWhile it is possible that John may experience both depression and acidity, the information provided and the current medical understanding suggest that depression is more likely to co-occur with migraine than acidity.",
