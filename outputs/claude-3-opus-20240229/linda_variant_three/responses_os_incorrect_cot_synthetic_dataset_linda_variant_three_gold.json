Malaise, which is a general feeling of discomfort, illness, or fatigue, is a common symptom of Dengue fever. In fact, it is one of the most frequently reported symptoms in patients with Dengue.\n\n3.

The fact that Pat is a 57-year-old transgender person does not have any direct relevance to the likelihood of experiencing specific Dengue symptoms, as the virus affects individuals regardless of their age or gender identity.\n\n5.

Common symptoms associated with migraines include:\n   - Throbbing or pulsing pain, usually on one side of the head\n   - Sensitivity to light, sound, and sometimes smells\n   - Nausea and vomiting\n   - Blurred vision\n   - Lightheadedness, sometimes followed by fainting\n\n3. Excessive hunger (polyphagia) is not a typical symptom directly associated with migraines. It is more commonly related to conditions such as diabetes or hyperthyroidism.\n\n4. Acidity, or acid reflux, is a digestive disorder that can cause symptoms like heartburn, regurgitation, and nausea. While nausea is a common symptom of both acid reflux and migraines, there is no strong direct link between migraines and acidity.\n\n5.

Fatigue is a common symptom associated with varicose veins. When varicose veins interfere with circulation, it can cause the legs to feel heavy and tired, leading to a general sense of fatigue.\n\n3. Cramps, particularly in the lower legs, are another frequent symptom of varicose veins. The cramping may worsen after prolonged sitting or standing.\n\n4.

Strokes occur when high blood pressure damages the blood vessels in the brain, leading to a lack of oxygen supply.\n\n4.

The primary symptom of Impetigo is a rash featuring red sores that may burst, ooze fluid, and develop a yellow-brown crust.\n\n3. Impetigo usually appears on the face, particularly around the nose and mouth, and on the hands and feet.\n\n4. Fever is not a common symptom of Impetigo. In rare cases, a person with a weakened immune system or a more severe form of Impetigo may develop a fever.\n\nBased on these characteristics, we can conclude that:\n\n(b) The 59-year-old African American woman is more likely to experience skin rash along with her Impetigo, as skin rash is the primary and most common symptom of this condition.\n\nWhile it is possible for her to develop a fever, it is less likely, as fever is not a typical symptom of Impetigo in most cases.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (b) She also experiences skin rash.",

Bladder discomfort is a common symptom of UTIs due to the inflammation and irritation in the urinary tract.\n\n3. The feeling of continuously needing to urinate, even after just using the bathroom, is another common symptom of UTIs. This is because the inflammation in the urinary tract can cause the sensation of needing to urinate, even when the bladder is not full.\n\n4.

The infection usually appears as red sores around the nose and mouth, which can break open and develop a yellow-brown crust.\n\n3. Impetigo often begins with a small blister or pimple, which then develops into a larger blister that eventually ruptures and forms a honey-colored crust.\n\n4. The presence of blisters is a common feature of Impetigo, especially in its early stages.\n\nConsidering these points, option (a) \"He has a red sore around his nose and a blister\" is more likely than option (b) \"He has a red sore around his nose.\" \n\nThe presence of a blister along with the red sore is a more complete and typical presentation of Impetigo, as blisters are a common feature of this condition.

Palpitations, which are feelings of a rapidly or forcefully beating heart, can be a symptom of hypoglycemia.
