It causes frequent heartburn and acid reflux, leading to acidity.\n\nWhile some people with GERD may also experience migraines, it is not as common as acidity.

However, depression is more common than tinnitus overall in the general population.\n\nThe probability of having both depression and tinnitus, given migraines, will be lower than the probability of having just depression, because it's a subset.

Weakness or paralysis on one side of the body (hemiparesis or hemiplegia) is a common symptom of brain hemorrhage, as the bleeding can damage the brain tissue responsible for controlling motor functions on the opposite side of the body.\n\n2. Excessive sneezing is not a typical symptom associated with brain hemorrhages.
