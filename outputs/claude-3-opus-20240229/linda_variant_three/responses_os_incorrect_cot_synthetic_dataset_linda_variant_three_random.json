While headaches can occur in some cases, they are not as commonly associated with chronic cholestasis compared to the other listed symptoms.\n\n4. Loss of appetite, on the other hand, is a more frequent symptom of chronic cholestasis due to the buildup of bile acids affecting digestion and causing discomfort.\n\n5.

The most common symptoms are a strong, persistent urge to urinate, a burning sensation when urinating, and passing frequent, small amounts of urine.\n\n2) Bladder discomfort is a very common symptom of UTIs. As the infection causes inflammation and irritation in the bladder, discomfort or pain in the bladder area is highly likely.\n\n3) Insomnia, on the other hand, is not a typical or direct symptom of UTIs. While the discomfort and frequent urge to urinate caused by a UTI might disrupt sleep, insomnia itself is not directly caused by the infection.\n\n4) The woman's age and ethnicity do not significantly affect the likelihood of specific UTI symptoms.\n\n5) Therefore, while both scenarios are possible, the one that only includes bladder discomfort is more probable, as it is a direct and common symptom of UTIs.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, (b) \"She experiences bladder discomfort\" is more likely than (a) \"She experiences bladder discomfort and insomnia.\"",

Hemorrhoids are swollen veins in the lower rectum and anus that can cause discomfort, pain, and bleeding during bowel movements.\n\n2. One of the most common symptoms of hemorrhoids is bloody stool. This is because the swollen veins can rupture during bowel movements, leading to bleeding.\n\n3. Sneezing is not typically associated with hemorrhoids. Sneezing is a reflex action caused by irritation in the nose or throat, and it does not directly relate to the rectal area where hemorrhoids occur.\n\n4. While it is possible for someone with hemorrhoids to experience sneezing episodes, there is no direct link between the two conditions. Sneezing and hemorrhoids are not medically related.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, option (a) is more likely: Susan, who has been diagnosed with hemorrhoids, is more likely to experience bloody stool as a symptom of her condition.

Acidity, or acid reflux, is a common gastrointestinal issue. While there is no direct link between Migraines and acidity, some people may experience both conditions.\n\n5. Itchy skin is not typically associated with Migraines. It could be related to a separate condition or an allergic reaction.\n\n6. Given that acidity is more commonly experienced alongside Migraines compared to itchy skin, it is more probable that Maria experiences acidity in addition to her Migraines, without necessarily having itchy skin as well.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and the reasoning above, option (b) is more likely: Maria, who has been diagnosed with Migraine, also experiences acidity.",

Chest pain can be a symptom associated with hypertension, especially if the hypertension is not well-controlled. High blood pressure can put extra strain on the heart, potentially leading to chest pain or discomfort.\n\n3. Athlete's foot, on the other hand, is a fungal skin infection that typically affects the feet. It is not directly related to hypertension or the cardiovascular system.\n\n4. The presence of athlete's foot would be an independent condition, not particularly correlated with Morgan's age or hypertension diagnosis.\n\n5. Therefore, while it's possible for Morgan to have both chest pain and athlete's foot, the additional presence of athlete's foot is not made more likely by the information given (age, ethnicity, hypertension diagnosis).\n\nBased on this, option (b) is more likely: It is more probable that Morgan, with hypertension, would also experience chest pain, as compared to the probability of experiencing both chest pain and athlete's foot.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (b) Morgan also experiences chest pain.",
