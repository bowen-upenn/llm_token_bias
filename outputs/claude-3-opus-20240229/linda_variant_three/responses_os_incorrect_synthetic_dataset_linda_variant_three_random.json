Gastroenteritis often leads to dehydration due to diarrhea and vomiting, which are common symptoms of the condition. However, there is no direct link between gastroenteritis and a sudden increase in nail growth rate. Therefore, option (b), which only includes dehydration as an additional symptom, is more probable than option (a), which includes both dehydration and an unrelated symptom (sudden increase in nail growth rate).",
