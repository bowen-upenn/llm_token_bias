This backflow of acid can cause symptoms such as heartburn, regurgitation, and difficulty swallowing.\n\nAcidity, or acid reflux, is a common symptom of GERD.

The primary symptom associated with cervical spondylosis is neck pain, which can range from mild to severe.\n\nWhile some individuals with cervical spondylosis may experience headaches, it is not as common or consistently present as neck pain. Headaches can be a referred pain from the neck, but they do not occur in all cases of cervical spondylosis.\n\nTherefore, option (b), which states that the patient experiences neck pain, is more likely than option (a), which includes both neck pain and frequent headaches.

People with migraine are about 2-4 times more likely to experience depression compared to those without migraine.\n\n- Tinnitus: Tinnitus, the perception of noise or ringing in the ears, is also more common in individuals with migraine.
