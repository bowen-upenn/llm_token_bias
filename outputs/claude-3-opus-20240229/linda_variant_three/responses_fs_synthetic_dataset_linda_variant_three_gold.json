This is because the average age for menopause (the cessation of menstrual periods) is around 51 years old, with most women experiencing menopause between the ages of 45 and 55. Therefore, at 65 years old, Sunita has likely already gone through menopause and would not experience menstrual irregularities.\n\nOn the other hand, muscle weakness is a common symptom of hyperthyroidism that can affect individuals of any age, including those who are 65 years old.
