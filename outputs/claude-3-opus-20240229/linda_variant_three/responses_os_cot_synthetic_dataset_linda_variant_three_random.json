Athlete's foot is a fungal infection of the skin, usually between the toes. It is not directly related to hypertension or chest pain.\n\n4. The probability of Morgan experiencing chest pain, given their age and hypertension diagnosis, is higher than the probability of experiencing both chest pain and athlete's foot together.\n\n5. This is because athlete's foot is an independent condition that is not related to hypertension or chest pain. Adding an independent condition to the scenario reduces the overall probability.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (b) Morgan also experiences chest pain. The addition of athlete's foot in option (a) makes it less likely than option (b), which only includes a symptom directly related to Morgan's existing condition.",

Hepatitis B is a viral infection that can be transmitted through blood, semen, or other body fluids. Common modes of transmission include sexual contact, sharing of needles, and from mother to child during birth.\n\n3.

The heart muscle may have been damaged, making it harder for the heart to pump blood efficiently.
