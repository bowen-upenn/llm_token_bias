Common symptoms of cervical spondylosis include neck pain, stiffness, and weakness or numbness in the arms, hands, legs, or feet due to pressure on the spinal cord or nerve roots. Therefore, experiencing both neck pain and weakness in limbs is a more comprehensive and likely presentation of cervical spondylosis compared to neck pain alone.",

The most common symptoms of Hepatitis E include:\n- Yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice)\n- Fatigue\n- Nausea and vomiting\n- Abdominal pain\n- Loss of appetite\n- Dark urine\n- Joint pain\n\nIn most cases, Hepatitis E is a self-limiting disease, meaning that it resolves on its own without causing severe complications. The majority of people with Hepatitis E recover fully within 4-6 weeks.\n\nComa is a rare and severe complication of Hepatitis E that occurs in only a small percentage of cases, usually in pregnant women or individuals with pre-existing liver disease.\n\nGiven the information provided, the more likely scenario is:\n\n(a) He experiences yellowish skin.\n\nThis is because jaundice (yellowish skin) is a common symptom of Hepatitis E, while coma is a rare and severe complication that is less likely to occur in a 50-year-old African American man without any mentioned pre-existing liver conditions or other risk factors.",

Studies have shown that people with migraines are about 2-4 times more likely to experience depression compared to the general population.\n\nOn the other hand, while acidity or acid reflux can sometimes be a trigger for migraines in some individuals, it is not as strongly associated with migraines as depression is. Not everyone with migraines experiences acidity.\n\nGiven John's age and gender, he is at a higher risk for depression in general. The presence of migraines further increases this risk.\n\nTherefore, based on the available options and the known comorbidity between migraines and depression, I believe it is more likely that John experiences depression along with his migraines, rather than the combination of depression and acidity.",
