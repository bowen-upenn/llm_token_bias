Common symptoms of hypothyroidism include fatigue, weight gain, cold sensitivity (particularly in the hands and feet), dry skin, and constipation.\n\nWhile some people with hypothyroidism may experience increased sensitivity to noise, it is not as common a symptom as cold hands and feet. Therefore, without additional information, it is more likely that Ricardo experiences cold hands and feet (option a) than cold hands and feet combined with acute sensitivity to noise (option b).",
