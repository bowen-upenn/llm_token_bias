Common symptoms of this condition include:\n\n1. Swelling of the stomach (ascites) due to fluid accumulation\n2. Abdominal pain and tenderness\n3. Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)\n4. Fever\n5. Fatigue and weakness\n6. Nausea and vomiting\n\nSince both swelling of the stomach and abdominal pain are typical symptoms of alcoholic hepatitis, it is more likely that Judy experiences both symptoms together rather than just one of them.",

While brittle nails can also be a symptom, it is not as strongly associated with the condition as cold extremities. Without additional medical details, the scenario where Rohit has cold hands and feet seems more probable than him having both that symptom and brittle nails.

Common symptoms include diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and cramping. Severe or prolonged gastroenteritis can lead to dehydration, which can cause various signs and symptoms, including sunken eyes, dry mouth, increased thirst, decreased urine output, and fatigue.\n\nSince dehydration is a common complication of gastroenteritis, and sunken eyes are a typical sign of dehydration, it is more likely that Morgan experiences both dehydration and sunken eyes as a result of their gastroenteritis diagnosis.",
