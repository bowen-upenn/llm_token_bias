Swelling of the stomach (ascites) and abdominal pain are both common symptoms of this condition. The combination of these two symptoms is more specific to alcoholic hepatitis than swelling of the stomach alone, which could be caused by various other factors.",

Common symptoms of hypothyroidism include feeling cold, especially in the hands and feet, due to the body's reduced metabolic rate and decreased circulation to the extremities.\n\nWhile brittle nails can also be a symptom of hypothyroidism, it is not as common or as directly related to the condition as cold hands and feet. Therefore, option (a), which only mentions cold hands and feet, is more likely than option (b), which includes both cold hands and feet and brittle nails.",

        "use_multi_agents": false,
        "init_model_answer": "Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Morgan also experiences dehydration and sunken eyes.\n\nGastroenteritis is an inflammation of the stomach and intestines, often caused by viral or bacterial infections. Common symptoms of gastroenteritis include diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and fever. Severe or prolonged cases of gastroenteritis can lead to dehydration due to the loss of fluids through diarrhea and vomiting.\n\nDehydration, in turn, can cause various signs and symptoms, including sunken eyes, dry mouth, decreased urine output, and dizziness. Therefore, it is more likely that Morgan, who has been diagnosed with gastroenteritis, would experience both dehydration and sunken eyes as a consequence of the illness, rather than just dehydration alone.",
