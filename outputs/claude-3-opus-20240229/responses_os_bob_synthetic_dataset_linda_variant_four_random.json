His presence alone would spark tremendous interest in his life, presidency and the historical events and decisions of his era. There would be endless discussion and analysis comparing the challenges FDR faced (the Great Depression, World War II) to today's issues. \n\nHis physical appearance at age 63 when he died would be startling to a public that only knows him from old black and white photographs and film footage. Seeing FDR reanimated would make him and his times feel much more real and relevant to the present day.\n\nSo while FDR may choose not to give a speech out of concern for how it might be perceived or misconstrued, or a desire not to meddle in contemporary politics, his temporary resurrection would inevitably generate a huge surge of interest in his legacy and renewed examination of how the past century of US history has shaped where America finds itself today.

As a global tour, Emily is likely a very popular and well-known artist with a large fan base. It's unlikely that she would have low turnout throughout the tour.\n2. The first concert may have low audience turnout for various reasons, such as it being in a smaller city, poor local promotion, fans waiting to see reviews before buying tickets, etc. \n3. However, as the tour progresses and gains momentum, publicity, and positive word-of-mouth from early shows, demand and ticket sales would likely increase significantly.\n4. It's common for highly anticipated tours of major artists to sell out large venues like stadiums for multiple dates, especially later in the tour.\n\nSo while low turnout could happen for the first show, it's more probable that ticket sales and crowd sizes would grow substantially as her global tour continues, leading to multiple sold-out stadium shows.

Zelenskyy has become a very prominent global figure due to his leadership during the Ukraine crisis. There would likely be significant worldwide interest in a memoir providing his perspective on the events.\n\n2. Political memoirs by major world leaders often become bestsellers due to the author's prominence and the historical significance of the events covered, even if the writing itself receives mixed reviews. \n\n3. The ongoing Ukraine crisis is a major news story with extensive global interest and impact. A memoir covering it would have a very large potential audience.\n\n4. Zelenskyy has gained widespread admiration for his leadership, which could translate to book sales even if critics find flaws in the memoir itself.\n\nSo while one cannot say for certain, the likely high profile and built-in audience for a Zelenskyy memoir suggests a significant chance of bestseller status despite the possibility of poor reviews. But (b) seems more probable than (a) based on the broader context.",

A speech only focused on industrialization seems less likely than one that also incorporates the Gandhian ideals that the name Aarav Karamchand Gandhi strongly evokes.",

International media outlets tend to focus on events and stories of global significance or interest.\n\nWhile the event could potentially strengthen Fernando and Mme Isabella's domestic support, as mentioned in option (b), this does not necessarily make that scenario more likely than the event simply receiving no international coverage at all. Domestic political impact and international media coverage are separate considerations.\n\nTherefore, without additional context suggesting the event is particularly noteworthy on a global scale, the more probable outcome is that it does not receive international media coverage, making option (a) more likely.",

Option (b) is a more specific scenario, as it includes not only the movie winning no awards but also becoming a box office hit. Option (a), on the other hand, is a more general statement that the movie simply wins no awards, without specifying its box office performance.\n\nGiven that the vast majority of movies do not win major awards, it is statistically more probable that the movie will not receive any accolades. However, the success of a movie at the box office depends on various factors such as marketing, audience appeal, and competition from other films released at the same time.\n\nSince option (b) requires the movie to satisfy two conditions (no awards and box office success), while option (a) only requires one condition (no awards), option (a) is inherently more likely to occur.",

Without being immersed in these developments over time, he would likely struggle to quickly comprehend the intricate modern geopolitical context.\n\nWhile option (b) presents an optimistic outcome of Marshall eventually brokering a groundbreaking agreement despite initial struggles, it relies on more assumptions beyond the information given. Achieving such a feat would require not only adapting to contemporary geopolitics, but also possessing exceptional diplomatic skills and being in a significant position of influence.
