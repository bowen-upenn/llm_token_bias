Statement (a) is simple and straightforward: It states that Chlo\u00eb Sevigny is rumored to be filling Demi's role in a film called Lovelace. This is a single, specific claim.\n\n3. Statement (b) makes the same claim as (a), but adds additional details: not only is Chlo\u00eb Sevigny rumored for Demi's Lovelace role, but she is also said to be co-starring with Ryan Gosling in Demi's next blockbuster film.\n\n4. Basic probability theory tells us that the probability of a single event (like statement a) is always greater than or equal to the probability of that event AND another event occurring together (like statement b).\n\n5. In other words, the additional specificity of statement (b) - the claim about co-starring with Ryan Gosling in another film - makes it less likely to be true than the simpler statement (a).\n\nTherefore, statement (a) \"Demi's Lovelace role is rumoured to be filled by Chlo\u00eb Sevigny\" is more likely to be true.\n\nThe correct answer is (a).",

Option (a) suggests that the girl's stepmother is indicted on a felony murder charge. This is plausible because if the stepmother was also involved in the punishment that led to the child's death, she could face charges.\n\n3. Option (b) adds that the stepmother's indictment is to prevent her from influencing the grandmother's trial. This additional detail is not supported by the given information and seems less likely.

The question is asking us to compare the probability of two statements related to the earthquake in Japan and a damaged nuclear plant.\n\n2. Statement (a) says: \"The crisis at a damaged nuclear plant is yet to be resolved\". This statement on its own is quite plausible given the information provided about a deadly earthquake hitting Japan.\n\n3. Statement (b) says: \"The crisis at a damaged nuclear plant is yet to be resolved to and there are fears of radioactive leakage.\" Note that this statement contains all the information in statement (a), with an additional claim about fears of radioactive leakage.\n\n4. A general principle of probability is that the probability of two events both occurring (A and B) is always less than or equal to the probability of either event occurring alone (A or B). This is because for A and B to both be true, A has to be true and B also has to be true. There are more ways for just A or just B to be true than for both to be true together.\n\n5. Applying this principle here, the probability of the crisis being unresolved AND there being fears of leakage (statement b) must be less than or equal to the probability of just the crisis being unresolved (statement a). \n\n6. Therefore, statement (a) is more probable than statement (b).\n\nSo the correct answer is (a) The crisis at a damaged nuclear plant is yet to be resolved.",

Option (b) starts with the same statement as (a), but then appends additional information: \"No passengers were injured in the train, official says, and the driver of the car was cited for reckless driving.\"\n\n4.

If it's unclear how many structures are homes, then we have less information about injuries in homes specifically, compared to injuries in the flooding overall.\n\n6. With less specific information about residential homes, it's safer to conclude about the flooding in general than about homes specifically.\n\nTherefore, option (a) \"No injuries were reported in the flooding\" is more likely to be true based on the given information. We can make a claim about overall injuries with more confidence than injuries in homes specifically.",

The two options differ in the reason provided for this switch.\n\n2. Option (a) simply states that all Hotmail users will eventually be switched to Outlook, without providing any reason.\n\n3. Option (b) also states that all Hotmail users will be switched, but adds the reason that it is \"to improve system efficiency and user satisfaction.\"\n\n4. The additional information about the reason in (b) makes it a more specific claim than (a). \n\n5. In general, more specific claims are less likely to be true than more general claims. This is because the specific claim needs to fulfill additional conditions.\n\n6. The question stem does not provide any information to support the specific reason given in (b).

This suggests the GOP brand is not viewed favorably by many Americans at the moment.\n\n2. An even larger majority (68%) think the GOP is not cooperating enough with the President. This further implies dissatisfaction with the GOP's current approach and brand perception.\n\n3. Option (a) states the GOP brand has begun to rebound and only slightly lags Democrats in popularity. However, the poll results do not support this conclusion. The negative views towards the GOP expressed in the poll are inconsistent with the idea that their brand is rebounding.\n\n4. Option (b) adds to option (a) by saying the slight lag behind Democrats is \"to increase bipartisanship in Congress.\" However, the poll shows Americans believe the GOP is not cooperating enough with the President, which contradicts the notion that their popularity is linked to increasing bipartisanship.\n\n5. Neither option is well-supported by the information provided. However, option (a) is more likely to be true than option (b), as it does not make the additional unsupported claim about increasing bipartisanship.\n\nTherefore, while neither option seems highly likely given the poll results, the answer that is more likely to be true is (a) The GOP brand has begun to rebound, now only slightly lagging Democrats in terms of popularity.",

The specific mention of brain imaging in option (b) is not as relevant to the main point about group influence on decision-making.",

        "init_model_answer": "To determine which option is more likely, let's break this down step-by-step:\n\n1. Celebrities' graves often attract many visitors and can become public shrines. This suggests that celebrity grave sites may require extra security measures.\n\n2. The fact that grave hunters specifically mention people trying to visit Michael Jackson's burial site implies that his grave, in particular, is likely to draw a lot of attention and potential visitors.\n\n3. Forest Lawn Memorial Park employees refusing to confirm whether Jackson's body is there could be seen as an attempt to protect the privacy of the site and deter potential visitors.\n\n4. Option (a) states that the funeral company has stringent security patrols, which aligns with the idea that celebrity graves may require extra security. However, it doesn't specifically mention Michael Jackson's grave.\n\n5. Option (b) not only mentions the stringent security patrols but also directly connects them to keeping fans away from Michael Jackson's specific grave site. This aligns more closely with the information provided about grave hunters and the refusal to confirm Jackson's burial location.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the reasoning above, option (b) \"Funeral company has stringent security patrol to keep fans from visiting Michael Jackson's specific grave site\" is more likely.",

        "init_model_answer": "Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. The question is asking which of the two statements is more likely to be true.\n\n2. Both statements contain the same quote: \"We are just all devastated,\" says her father, Mickey Harte. The difference is in the additional context provided in option (b).\n\n3. Option (a) simply states the quote without any additional information about the circumstances under which it was said.\n\n4. Option (b) adds the context that Mickey Harte said this quote \"to a group of reporters after hearing the news.\"\n\n5. In a tragic situation like this, it is common for the family to make a statement to the press. Therefore, the additional context in option (b) makes it a more likely scenario.\n\n6. Option (a) is a subset of option (b). If (b) is true, then (a) must also be true. However, (a) being true doesn't necessarily mean (b) is true.\n\nTherefore, based on the principle of probability and the additional contextual information, option (b) \"We are just all devastated,\" says her father, Mickey Harte to a group of reporters after hearing the news, is more likely to be true.",
