        "question": "Harry was running late for his job interview. He had to throw on some clothes fresh out of the dryer. When he got to the interview, he realized the pants were still wet. He was very uncomfortable. It must have been obvious, because he didn't get the job.\nWhich is more likely?\n(a) The protagonist, Harry, would likely find a way to dry his pants quickly or change into a dry pair.\n(b) The protagonist, Harry, would likely find a way to dry his pants quickly or change into a dry pair because he has a preference for listening to jazz music while driving.",

        "init_model_answer": "(a) The protagonist, Harry, would likely find a way to dry his pants quickly or change into a dry pair. \n\nExplaining the reasoning:\n\nOption (a) is more likely than option (b) because it focuses solely on the situation at hand, which is Harry needing to address the wet pants to avoid discomfort and potential negative consequences during the job interview. \n\nOption (b) introduces an extraneous detail about Harry's musical preference, which is irrelevant to the problem of the wet pants and doesn't contribute to predicting his actions. Including such irrelevant information can obfuscate the core issue and make option (b) less likely. \n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, option (a) presents the more probable scenario. \n",

While her previous aspiration was to become a police officer, her present reality involves caring for her loved ones. \n\nOption (b) introduces an extraneous element - enjoying rainy days - that lacks a clear connection to Amanda's family life. Therefore, (a) presents a more direct and plausible conclusion based on the information provided. \n",
