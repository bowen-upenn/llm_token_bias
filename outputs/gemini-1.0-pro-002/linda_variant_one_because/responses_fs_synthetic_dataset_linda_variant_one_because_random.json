He was very uncomfortable. It must have been obvious, because he didn't get the job.\nWhich is more likely?\n(a) The protagonist, Harry, would likely find a way to dry his pants quickly or change into a dry pair.\n(b) The protagonist, Harry, would likely find a way to dry his pants quickly or change into a dry pair because he has a preference for listening to jazz music while driving.",

A person in such a situation would naturally try to rectify it by drying or changing clothes before attending an important event like a job interview. \n\nThe additional information about Harry's preference for jazz music is irrelevant to the situation and does not influence the probability of him taking action to address the wet pants issue. \n",
