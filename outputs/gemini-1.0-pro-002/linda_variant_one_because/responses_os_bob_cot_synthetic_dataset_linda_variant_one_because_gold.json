The lack of further attempts to convince the parents could suggest acceptance of their decision. \n* **Limited information about Dubby's ferret:** The passage doesn't provide details about the ferret's personality or how long the protagonist played with it. This makes it difficult to assess the strength of the emotional connection formed. \n**Therefore, based on the available information, option (b) appears more likely.

Lisa took many photos while in Bhutan.

They loved visiting the zoo, the lion was their favorite, and they immediately rushed to see him upon arrival. \n* **Concern and empathy**: The news of the lion's illness likely caused concern and empathy within the kids. This concern motivates their desire to see the lion and check on its well-being. \n* **Natural progression**: Visiting the lion at the veterinary facility aligns with the established emotional connection and concern. It allows the kids to directly observe the lion's condition and potentially offer some form of comfort or support.\n\nWhile option (a) simply states the action of visiting the lion, option (b) provides a more comprehensive understanding of the **motivation** behind the action, making it the more likely scenario. \n",

Xena saw they were dropping from the light fixture above her.

Turning on the shower water would create a barrier between her and the spiders, flushing them away and preventing them from crawling on her. While option (a) is technically possible, it doesn't address the immediate threat of the spiders and wouldn't be as effective in removing them. \n",

While it's true that Francis might apologize, the reason remains unclear.\n\n**(b) Francis would apologize to his grandparents because he felt guilty and wanted to restore the good relationship.**\n\nThis option delves deeper, suggesting that Francis' apology would stem from guilt and a desire to repair the damaged relationship with his grandparents. This seems more likely considering the disapproval he faced and the potential strain it caused.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, **option (b)** appears more likely. Francis' remorse and understanding of the offense's impact on his grandparents make an apology driven by guilt and a desire for reconciliation a stronger possibility. \n",
