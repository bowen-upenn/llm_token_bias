While the prompt mentions Amanda's initial aspirations to be a police officer, it also highlights her current role as a stay-at-home mom with a happy family. This indicates that she prioritizes caring for and spending time with her loved ones. \n\nOption (b) introduces an irrelevant detail about enjoying rainy days, which has no bearing on the likelihood of Amanda prioritizing her family. \n",

The passage describes Ted's experience of feeling less hungry when he starts eating a granola bar and drinking a glass of milk on his way to work. This suggests that he will continue this habit as it has been successful in alleviating his hunger. \n\n**Option (b)** is not supported by the passage. There is no mention of Ted enjoying jazz music in the evening, and it is not relevant to his breakfast routine. \n",
