        "question": "Tom bragged to all his American friends about his amazing beach life in Mexico. His friends didn't like the blowhard, but loved having his friendship. Then the United States elected a xenophobic President. He built a giant wall to keep everyone in Mexico out. The giant wall kept Tom out, too.\nWhich is more likely?\n(a) Tom would likely try to contact his friends for help or support to return to the United States.\n(b) Tom would likely try to contact his friends for help or support to return to the United States so that he could resume his former job and routine in his hometown.",

        "use_multi_agents": false,
        "init_model_answer": "(a) Tom would likely try to contact his friends for help or support to return to the United States.\n\nThe giant wall separates Tom from his American friends, and he is likely feeling isolated and vulnerable in Mexico. He will need help and support to navigate the new landscape and find a way back to the United States. His former friends are in a position to offer this support, as they have connections and resources in the US. While returning to his former job and routine in his hometown may be part of his ultimate plan, Tom's first priority would likely be getting back to the United States in a situation where his basic needs are met and he feels secure.\n",

        "question": "Harry is a 78 year old retired professor. He is rather arrogant and thinks he knows everything. Harry had been away on vacation but just returned. The concierge told me Harry had gotten into 3 fights already. I was amused and amazed.\nWhich is more likely?\n(a) Harry would likely start another argument or dispute with someone.\n(b) Harry would likely start another argument or dispute with someone so that he can establish his dominance in intellectual matters.",

        "init_model_answer": "The answer is (a). \n\nWhile it is plausible that Harry's arrogance and desire to prove himself intellectually might contribute to future arguments, the information provided in the scenario primarily suggests a general tendency towards conflict and argumentativeness. This inclination to engage in disputes is not explicitly tied to intellectual dominance. \n\nTherefore, the broader likelihood of Harry starting another argument, irrespective of the specific motivation, holds greater weight.",

        "question": "My sister-in-law Hilda is a smoker. We used to go to NH to visit friends often. There was no tax on cigarettes in NH, as opposed to MA. Hilda asked me to buy her a carton of cigarettes to save money. I did so, but she never paid me for the cigarettes.\nWhich is more likely?\n(a) The protagonist would likely ask Hilda to pay for the cigarettes.\n(b) The protagonist would likely ask Hilda to pay for the cigarettes so that she could use the money to buy more cigarettes next time they visit NH.",

        "use_multi_agents": false,
        "init_model_answer": "(a) The protagonist would likely ask Hilda to pay for the cigarettes. \n\n**Explanation:**\n\nWhile Hilda's intention to save money by buying cigarettes in NH is understandable, it's important to remember that the protagonist incurred a financial expense on her behalf. It's reasonable to expect Hilda to reimburse the protagonist for the cost of the cigarettes. Option (b) suggests that the protagonist would prioritize Hilda's future cigarette purchases over recouping the money she already spent. This seems less likely, as the protagonist has already gone out of her way to help Hilda save money. \n",
