Therefore, it's less likely to be her immediate focus after missing the workout, especially given her current time constraint due to being late for work.\n \n",

He has also already gotten into 3 fights since returning from vacation. This suggests that he is easily angered and prone to conflict. Therefore, it is more likely that he would start another argument or dispute with someone than that he would do so in order to choose what to have for dinner.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the concierge found Harry's behavior amusing and amazing suggests that it was unexpected or out of character for him. This further supports the idea that he is not likely to start another argument or dispute with someone in order to choose what to have for dinner.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is (a) Harry would likely start another argument or dispute with someone.",

The subsequent sentence, \"Aya was startled!\" emphasizes her surprise and likely desire to prevent a similar incident from happening again. Closing the windows would be the most logical and immediate action to take to address this concern.\n\nWhile listening to music without outside noise could be a motivating factor for closing the windows, the passage provides no direct evidence of this intention. The primary focus is on addressing the immediate issue of the bird and preventing its re-entry. Therefore, option (a) is more likely based on the information presented.",
