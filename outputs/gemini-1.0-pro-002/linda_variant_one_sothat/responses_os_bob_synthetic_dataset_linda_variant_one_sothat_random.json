He still needs to address the underlying issue of high blood pressure, and proactively managing his health is essential for long-term well-being. \n\nOption (b), while mentioning proactivity in health management, adds an extraneous and irrelevant detail about learning Hawaiian. This factor doesn't contribute to his health directly and seems like an unnecessary addition.\n\nTherefore, considering the limited information about Stanley's mindset and actions after his doctor's advice, continuing to manage his health proactively (option a) appears more likely. \n",
