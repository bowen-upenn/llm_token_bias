It implies that James understands the importance of maintaining a close bond with his child and ensuring their emotional well-being. He recognizes that spending quality time together is crucial for achieving these goals.\n\nOption (a), on the other hand, suggests that James' motivation for spending time with his child is simply because he is able to do so when possible.

Therefore, option (b) aligns more closely with the presented information. \n",

I did so, but she never paid me for the cigarettes.\nWhich is more likely?\n(a) The protagonist would likely ask Hilda to pay for the cigarettes.\n(b) The protagonist would likely ask Hilda to pay for the cigarettes so that she could use the money to buy more cigarettes next time they visit NH.",

Additionally, asking Hilda to pay for the cigarettes would be the more honest and direct approach, and it would allow the protagonist to recoup the money they spent. \n",
