The wall separating him from his life disrupts that stability, making him more likely to seek a return to normalcy.\n* **Friendship support:** Despite his earlier bragging, his friends ultimately valued his company. This friendship network could provide support and resources for his return.\n* **Limited options in Mexico:** The wall likely restricts his opportunities and access to resources. Returning to his established life in the US would offer more potential for improving his situation.\n\nWhile Tom might initially seek help just to get back into the US, his ultimate goal would likely be to resume his previous life as closely as possible, which involves his job and familiar routine.\n\nTherefore, **(b)** is the more probable outcome given the provided information and the established context.",
