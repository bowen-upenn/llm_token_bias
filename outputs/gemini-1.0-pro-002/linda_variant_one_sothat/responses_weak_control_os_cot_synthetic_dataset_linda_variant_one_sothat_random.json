Tom received a ticket for a legitimate reason (playing loud music), and simply paying it would resolve the issue without further complications.\n\n**(b) Tom would pay the ticket so that he could have dinner with his friends later that evening:**\n\nThis option introduces an additional, unrelated factor: Tom's dinner plans. While it's possible he might prioritize dinner, the connection to the ticket payment seems less direct. He could potentially reschedule or explain his situation to his friends.\n\n## Applying the Linda Problem Logic:\n\nRecalling the Linda Problem, we concluded that the **more specific option (a), focusing solely on being a bank teller, was more likely than the conjunction (b), combining being a bank teller and being active in the feminist movement.**\n\nSimilarly, in Tom's case:\n\n* **Option (a)** focuses solely on the expected action: paying the ticket.\n* **Option (b)** introduces an additional, less relevant factor: having dinner with friends.\n\nTherefore, following the logic of the Linda Problem, **(a) Tom would pay the ticket** appears to be the more likely option. \n",

While both options involve James spending time with his child, option (b) adds an additional, seemingly unrelated element \u2013 catching up on TV shows. This additional information makes option (b) more specific and, therefore, less probable than the broader statement in option (a).\n\nHere's another way to think about it:\n\n* **Option (a):** Focuses solely on the primary action \u2013 spending quality time with his child. This aligns with the information provided about James being a dedicated father who prioritizes his child's well-being.\n* **Option (b):** Introduces an extraneous element \u2013 watching TV \u2013 that seems unrelated to the core behavior of spending quality time with his child. This additional information reduces the likelihood of option (b) being true.\n\nTherefore, similar to the Linda problem, where the single characteristic of being a bank teller is more likely than the conjunction of being a bank teller and a feminist, in the James scenario, option (a) \u2013 spending quality time with his child \u2013 appears more probable than option (b), which includes the additional element of watching TV. \n\nHowever, it's important to remember that this is a thought experiment and not a definitive answer. Real-life situations are complex and often involve multiple factors influencing behavior. \n",

Evaluating Options:**\n\n**(a) Close Monitoring:**\n\n* **Supporting Factors:** \n    * The wife's initial strong motivation to catch her husband.\n    * Uncertainty about his faithfulness might fuel continued monitoring. \n* **Counterarguments:**\n    * Lack of recent evidence of infidelity might decrease motivation.\n    * The desire to improve photography skills could offer an alternative focus.\n\n**(b) Close Monitoring for Photography:**\n\n* **Supporting Factors:**\n    * The wife's expressed interest in improving her photography skills.\n    * Using the fake Facebook page for photography practice could be convenient.\n* **Counterarguments:**\n    * The original purpose of the page was not photography-related.\n    * The emotional baggage associated with the page might hinder its use for enjoyment.\n\n**4.
