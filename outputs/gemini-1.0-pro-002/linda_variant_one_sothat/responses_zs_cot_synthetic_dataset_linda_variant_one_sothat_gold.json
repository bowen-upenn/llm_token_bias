Tom likely understands that contesting the ticket would be a hassle and potentially more expensive in the long run. Additionally, he may feel responsible for the violation and accept the consequences.\n\n**(b) Tom would pay the ticket so that he could continue to use his new car stereo without further issues.** \nThis option is less likely.

Tom would likely pay the ticket to avoid further complications and accept the consequences of his actions. \n",
