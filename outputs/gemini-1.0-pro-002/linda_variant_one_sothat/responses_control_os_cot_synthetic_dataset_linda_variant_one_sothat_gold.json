This negative experience reinforces the importance of her exercise routine for her daily functioning. \n\n**4. Likelihood of Catching Up on Exercise:**\n\n**(a) Catching Up Later in the Day:** Given Ellen's consistent exercise habit and the negative consequences of missing it, she is highly likely to try and find time later in the day to complete her exercise. This option directly addresses the disruption of her routine and aims to restore her usual energy levels. \n\n**(b) Catching Up and Preventing Future Mistakes:** While catching up on exercise might address the immediate issue, it doesn't directly address the root cause of Ellen's mistake (taking the wrong bus due to low energy). \n\nTherefore, **option (a) is more likely** as it directly addresses the disruption caused by missing the exercise and aims to restore Ellen's usual routine and well-being. \n\nOption (b), although seemingly logical, introduces an additional element of preventing future mistakes that might not be the primary motivation in this specific situation. \n\nIn conclusion, based on the analysis, **option (a) - Ellen trying to find time later in the day to exercise - is the more probable scenario.** \n",

Therefore, option (a) is more likely to occur than option (b).\n\nWhile the purpose of Tim's call is likely to prevent being marked tardy, the question directly asks about the likelihood of the call itself, not its intended outcome. \n\nTherefore, focusing solely on the action of calling, option (a) presents a higher probability due to its simpler nature compared to the conjunction in option (b). \n",
