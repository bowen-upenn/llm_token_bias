This means:\n\n* **Abstracting the problem**: We need to focus solely on the events themselves and their individual probabilities, disregarding the narrative context and any extraneous details.\n* **Applying basic probability rules**: We need to remember that the probability of a conjunction of two events (like option b) is always less than or equal to the probability of each individual event (like option a).\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n* **(a) The protagonist would likely try to find time later in the day to exercise.** This option only focuses on the event of exercising later. It is a single event and can be analyzed independently of the oversleeping incident. The protagonist might choose to exercise to regain her energy level and feel better prepared for the rest of the day.\n* **(b) The protagonist would likely try to find time later in the day to exercise so that she won't repeat the same mistake tomorrow.** This option combines two events: exercising later and doing so specifically to avoid repeating the same mistake. It is a conjunction of two events and involves an additional purpose attached to the action of exercising.\n\nBased on basic probability principles, the individual event (option a) will always have a higher or equal probability compared to the conjunction of two events (option b). This is because the conjunction requires both the individual event and the additional purpose to be true. In simpler words, if Ellen finds time to exercise later, it automatically fulfills the condition of not repeating the mistake tomorrow (at least with regards to exercise and energy levels). However, there could be other reasons to avoid repeating the mistake, not necessarily linked to exercising. \n\nTherefore, adopting probabilistic thinking, the more likely option is:\n\n**(a) The protagonist, Ellen, would likely try to find time later in the day to exercise.**",

In **(b)**, Stanley's motivation for managing his health is explicitly tied to maintaining his lowered blood pressure.
