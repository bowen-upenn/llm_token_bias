This implies that there are potential negative consequences associated with such aid.\n- **Hamas**: The passage explicitly mentions that Israel fears the aid would bolster Hamas, a designated terrorist organization. \n- **Sanctions**: The inclusion of \"because it would violate existing sanctions against the terrorist organization\" further strengthens the argument. It suggests that Israel's opposition stems not just from concerns about Hamas, but also from the legal ramifications of violating sanctions.\n\nTherefore, considering the context, Hamas connection, and mention of sanctions violation, option (b) provides a more comprehensive and likely explanation for Israel's concerns. \n",

However, based on the information provided, option (b) seems to be more likely.\n\nHere are some additional thoughts on why option (b) is more likely:\n\n* **Correlation:**  There is a correlation between car accidents and neck injuries. This means that car accidents are often a cause of neck injuries.\n* **Context:**  Option (b) provides context about how Mr. Green might have gotten a neck injury. This context makes it more likely that option (b) is true.\n* **Logic:**  If Mr. Green was involved in a car accident, it is logical to think that he might have gotten a neck injury as a result of the accident. This makes option (b) more likely.\n\nOverall, based on the information provided, it seems more likely that a later MRI scan revealed Mr. Green had a severe neck injury because he was involved in a car accident.

Only a handful of countries support Argentina's claim.\n\nWhile both options acknowledge historical facts, option (b) delves into psychological reasoning, which cannot be definitively confirmed or denied without further analysis.
