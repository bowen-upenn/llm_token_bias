In this case, the two events are the sounds being a piece in the puzzle of what happened during the shooting and the fact that it was raining cats and dogs outside. It is important to note that the two events are independent of each other, meaning that the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other.

In this case, option (a) represents a single event (the neck injury), while option (b) represents a conjunction of two events (the neck injury and wearing mismatched socks). \n\nTherefore, even if there might be a correlation between wearing mismatched socks and having a severe neck injury, the probability of the single event (a) will always be higher than the probability of the conjunction (b). \n\nThis aligns with the concept of the conjunction fallacy, where the human mind tends to overestimate the likelihood of a conjunction of events compared to individual events. However, by focusing solely on the probabilistic aspect, we can eliminate this bias and arrive at the statistically more probable option: (a) A later MRI scan revealed Mr. Green had a severe neck injury. \n",

In this case, the conjunction of events is that Prince George will be present at some of his parents' engagements during their tour and that the royal family plans to introduce him to local customs and traditions. However, the probability of Prince George being present at some of his parents' engagements is independent of the probability of the royal family introducing him to local customs and traditions.

In this case, option (b) adds an additional layer of information about the nurse's motivation for stealing. \n\nHowever, the additional information provided in option (b) does not change the basic probability of the theft itself. Therefore, option (a) is more likely because it only focuses on the single event of the theft, while option (b) introduces an unnecessary layer of conjunctive information.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* Probabilistically, the probability of a single event (theft) is always greater than the probability of the same event happening with a specific additional condition (theft for buying golf clubs).\n* The reason for the theft (motivation) is irrelevant to the question of whether the theft happened.\n* Option (a) focuses on the single event of the theft, while option (b) introduces a conjunctive element (reason for theft), making it less likely.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on probabilistic reasoning and the principle of the conjunction fallacy, option (a) is the more likely scenario. \n",
