This is because Hamas controls Gaza and Israel views them as a terrorist organization. \n\n**(b) Israel fears any aid would bolster Hamas, officials say because Qatar has a new emir who is eager to improve relations in the region.**\nThis option builds upon option (a) by providing an additional reason for Israel's potential fear. However, the information about the new emir and their eagerness to improve relations is not directly mentioned in the provided information. \n\n## Step 3: Choose the most likely option\n\nBased on the available information, **option (a)** is more likely. While the information about the new emir might be relevant, it is not explicitly stated and therefore cannot be considered the primary reason for Israel's fear.\n",
