This seems more likely, considering the context provided:\n\n* **Man recorded sounds of gunfire during a video chat.** This implies a potential connection to the shooting, especially if the timing and location align.\n* **Man's lawyer: He inadvertently recorded sounds of Michael Brown shooting.** This statement further strengthens the connection, suggesting the lawyer acknowledges the recording's potential significance.\n* **FBI obtained the video.** The FBI's involvement indicates the seriousness with which they are treating the recording.\n\n**(b) The sounds could be a piece in the larger puzzle of what happened during the shooting because it was raining cats and dogs outside.**\n\nThis option seems less likely for several reasons:\n\n* **Irrelevant information:** The information about rain is not directly related to the shooting or the recorded sounds. \n* **Misleading statement:**  \"Raining cats and dogs\" is an idiom meaning heavy rain, not an actual event involving cats and dogs. This could be misinterpreted as a joke or irrelevant information.\n* **Lack of connection:**  There is no logical connection between the sound of gunfire and the weather condition.\n\n## Conclusion:\n\nBased on the context and available information, option (a) is more likely. The recorded sounds could potentially be a valuable piece of evidence in understanding the events surrounding the Michael Brown shooting. \n",
