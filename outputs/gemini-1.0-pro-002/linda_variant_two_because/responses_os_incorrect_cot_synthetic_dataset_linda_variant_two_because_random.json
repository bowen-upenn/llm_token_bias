The commandos killed nine Turkish activists on board the ship. The Israeli government claimed that the activists were trying to attack the commandos, but this claim has been disputed by witnesses. The incident caused a major international outcry and led to a significant deterioration in relations between Israel and Turkey.\nIt is important to note that the Israeli government has not released any evidence to support its claim that the activists on the Mavi Marmara were trying to attack the commandos. In fact, the available evidence suggests that the commandos may have used excessive force. The Israeli government has also refused to allow an independent investigation into the incident.\nGiven the available evidence, it is more likely that Israeli soldiers killed nine activists aboard another aid ship in May because they were trying to prevent the ship from delivering aid to Gaza.",

The focus of the scenario is the teenagers' alleged murder and the recording of the incident. Option (a) directly relates to this focus, as it involves a crime committed within the context of the victim's treatment at the hospital. \n\nFurthermore, including a specific reason like wanting to buy golf clubs in option (b) introduces speculation and biases the answer. Without any evidence to support this particular motivation, it weakens the option's overall plausibility.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, **option (a) is more likely**.  A nurse stealing from a patient, especially one who has just experienced a traumatic event, is unfortunately not uncommon. The details provided align with this possibility, making it the more reasonable scenario compared to the inclusion of a specific and unconfirmed motivation in option (b). \n",
