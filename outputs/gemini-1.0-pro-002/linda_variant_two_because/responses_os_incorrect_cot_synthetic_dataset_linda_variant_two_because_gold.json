It implies that they see Hamas as a potential threat and are worried that any aid reaching Gaza might strengthen their position. \n\n**Option (b):** Israel fears any aid would bolster Hamas, officials say because it would violate existing sanctions against the terrorist organization.\n\nThis statement expands on option (a) by providing a specific reason for Israel's fear. It highlights the existing sanctions against Hamas and suggests that Israel might be hesitant to allow aid due to the potential violation of these sanctions.\n\n## Assessing Likelihood:\n\nWhile both options express Israel's apprehension about aid reaching Hamas, option (b) offers a more detailed and specific explanation for this concern. The mention of existing sanctions against Hamas adds an additional layer of context and makes it a more likely reason for Israel's fear. \n\n## Conclusion:\n\nTherefore, it is more likely that **option (b), Israel fears any aid would bolster Hamas, officials say because it would violate existing sanctions against the terrorist organization, is the correct answer.**  It provides a more comprehensive and plausible explanation for Israel's concern regarding potential aid to Gaza. \n\n## Final Answer:\n\n**Yes, option (b) is more likely.**",

Comparing the probabilities:\n\nBased on the information provided:\n\n- **Option (a):** We only know that Mr. Green has a severe neck injury, but we don't know the cause. This could be due to various reasons, including the car accident mentioned in option (b), but also other possible causes like sports injuries, falls, or pre-existing medical conditions. \n- **Option (b):** This option provides a specific cause for the neck injury - the car accident. While other causes are still possible, the car accident is explicitly stated as the reason for the injury.\n\nTherefore, due to the additional context and explanation of the cause, **option (b) is more likely** compared to option (a).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the answer to your question is:\n\n**Yes,** option (b) is more likely than option (a).\n\n",

This statement is factual and can be verified through historical records.\n- **Statement 2:** Argentina still claims what it calls Las Malvinas. This statement is also factual and has ongoing political implications.\n\n**2. Exploring the likelihood of combined event:**\n\n- **Option (a):** The combined statement states that Britain won the war and Argentina still claims the territory. This aligns with the individual statements and presents a factual scenario.\n- **Option (b):** This option adds the justification that \"people tend to focus on specific details\" to explain Argentina's claim. While it's true that individuals often prioritize specific information, this justification doesn't alter the combined statements' factual accuracy. \n\n**3. Comparing the options:**\n\n- Both options (a) and (b) present the combined event as a factual outcome of the Falklands War. \n- Option (b) offers an additional explanation for Argentina's ongoing claim, but this explanation isn't crucial for determining the likelihood of the event itself. \n\n**4. Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the factual evidence and the absence of conflicting information, **both options (a) and (b) are equally likely**. While option (b) provides an insight into potential reasoning, it doesn't affect the factual outcome of the combined event.\n\nTherefore, without any additional information or specific focus on individual aspects, **neither option can be considered more likely than the other**. \n\n## Final Answer:\n\nNo, neither option (a) nor (b) is more likely than the other. Both present an equally likely factual outcome based on the available information. \n",
