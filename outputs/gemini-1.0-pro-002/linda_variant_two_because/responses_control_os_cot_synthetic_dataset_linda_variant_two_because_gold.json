The probability of a single event occurring is always higher than the probability of it occurring in conjunction with another specific event. Therefore, option (a) is statistically more probable than option (b).\n",

Therefore, the prior probability of both options is equal.\n\n2. **Likelihood:** \n    * Option (a): The sounds being related to the shooting is one possibility among many other potential explanations. The likelihood of this specific explanation depends on the details of the sounds, the context of the video chat, and other available evidence.\n    * Option (b): People do tend to jump to conclusions, especially with limited information and existing biases. However, this tendency doesn't automatically make option (b) more likely than option (a). We need concrete evidence to support the claim that the sounds are specifically related to the Michael Brown shooting due to someone jumping to conclusions.\n\n3. **Posterior Probability:** By combining the prior probability and likelihood, we can calculate the posterior probability of each option. However, without further information, it's impossible to definitively say which option is more likely.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the available information, we cannot definitively conclude which option is more likely. Both options remain possibilities, and further investigation is necessary to determine the true source of the gunfire sounds. \n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n\n* The man's lawyer claiming the sounds are from the Michael Brown shooting introduces an element of bias. This statement should be treated with caution and considered alongside other evidence.\n* The FBI's involvement suggests the possibility of a thorough investigation, which could shed more light on the origin of the sounds.\n\n**Remember:** It's crucial to avoid jumping to conclusions based on limited information and to prioritize evidence-based reasoning when evaluating competing possibilities. \n",

Option (b) states that Mr. Green had a severe neck injury because he was involved in a car accident.\n\nAccording to the conjunction fallacy, people tend to overestimate the probability of conjunctions of events compared to single events. In this case, option (b) is a conjunction of two events: Mr. Green having a severe neck injury and being involved in a car accident.\n\nTherefore, based on the conjunction fallacy, option (b) is more likely to be judged as more probable than option (a).\n\nHowever, from a purely probabilistic perspective, the probability of Mr. Green having a severe neck injury is independent of whether he was involved in a car accident. The two events are not mutually exclusive, meaning they can both be true.\n\nTherefore, the probability of option (a) is simply the probability of Mr. Green having a severe neck injury, while the probability of option (b) is the probability of Mr. Green having a severe neck injury multiplied by the probability of being involved in a car accident.\n\nSince the probability of being involved in a car accident is not 1, the probability of option (b) must be less than or equal to the probability of option (a).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) A later MRI scan revealed Mr Green had a severe neck injury.",
