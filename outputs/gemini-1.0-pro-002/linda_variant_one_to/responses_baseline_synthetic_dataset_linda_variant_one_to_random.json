This suggests a significant negative impact on his life due to alcohol.\n* **Addressing the root cause**:  Support groups and counseling specifically address alcohol-related issues, aiming to help individuals overcome addiction and develop healthy coping mechanisms. They do not focus on improving unrelated skills like cooking.\n* **Seeking help**:  Individuals facing addiction or significant life changes often seek external support and guidance. Support groups and counseling provide a safe space for sharing experiences, learning from others, and receiving professional help.\n* **Relevance to the situation**: Option (b) seems irrelevant and out of place in the context of Jon's experience and decision to quit alcohol. \n\nTherefore, considering the context of Jon's situation and the purpose of support groups and counseling, option (a) is the more likely scenario. \n",
