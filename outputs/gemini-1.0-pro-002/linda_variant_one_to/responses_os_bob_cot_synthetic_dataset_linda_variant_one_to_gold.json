(Option a)\n* Would Jordan continue wearing the new pants specifically to work? (Option b)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nBoth options are plausible based on the information provided. Here's why:\n\n* **Option a:** It's likely Jordan would continue wearing the new pants overall. They fit him comfortably, which would improve his overall comfort and satisfaction. He likely feels better and more confident in these pants compared to his old, tight ones.\n* **Option b:** Whether Jordan wears the new pants to work depends on his workplace environment and dress code. If the work environment is casual or allows for more comfortable clothing, then continuing to wear these pants to work seems likely. However, if the workplace requires formal attire or specific uniforms, he might choose different clothes for work while still enjoying his new pants in other contexts.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nDue to the provided information, it's **impossible to definitively choose** between options a and b. Both possibilities are equally likely. \n\nTo make a conclusive judgment, we would need additional information, such as:\n\n* Jordan's typical clothing style and attire preferences.\n* His workplace dress code and usual work attire.\n* Whether the new pants are considered formally appropriate for his workplace.\n\nWith more information, we could analyze the situation further and provide a more definitive answer. \n",

While this could potentially motivate Rick in the short term, it doesn't address the underlying issue of Rick understanding the **importance of flossing for his oral health**.\n\n**(b)** addresses both the **external motivation** of a higher reward and the **internal motivation** of avoiding dental issues.

By offering a higher reward and explaining the potential consequences of not flossing, Marty aims to address both the short-term and long-term aspects of motivating Rick to adopt a healthy habit. \n",

This indicates a focus on personal enjoyment and satisfaction, rather than an external goal like a concert.\n2. **Practice routine**: Daily practice suggests a dedicated effort to maintain the regained skill and possibly even further improve, aligning with personal enjoyment rather than specific concert preparation.\n3. **No mention of concert:** The passage lacks any mention of a concert or specific deadline, further supporting the notion of personal enjoyment as the driving force behind continued practice.\n\nWhile practicing for a concert is a possibility, the text provides stronger evidence to support the protagonist's motivation for continuing regular piano practice being personal enjoyment and skill development.\n",
