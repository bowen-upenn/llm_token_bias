Since the new pants fit perfectly, it's more likely Jordan would choose to wear them over the tighter, old pair.\n* **Practicality:** Jordan bought the new pants specifically because his old ones were too tight. This indicates a practical need for clothes that fit better.\n* **No additional information:** There's no mention of Jordan having any specific reason to wear the new pants only to work. It's more likely he would wear them in various situations where comfort and proper fit are desired.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, (a) is the more probable option. Jordan is likely to continue wearing his new, comfortable pants in various settings, not just at work. \n",

This negative experience would naturally lead to feelings of embarrassment and could potentially dampen her enthusiasm for singing publicly.\n* **The risk of further embarrassment is significant:** Participating in singing competitions exposes Amelia to the possibility of facing similar public scrutiny and ridicule.

This suggests a potential awareness of social norms and a desire to avoid causing offense. \n* **Desire for a closer look:** Despite wanting to avoid being rude, Charles' curiosity and desire to see his ex-girlfriend's bottom led him to take a closer look.

Confronting the matchmaker would be a way to express these emotions and potentially seek some form of resolution.\n\n- **Sense of injustice:** Cecelia believed in the matchmaker's services and trusted them to deliver. When they failed to do so, she would likely feel a sense of injustice and want to hold them accountable.\n\n- **Demand for explanation:** Beyond just expressing anger, Cecelia would likely want an explanation for why the service wasn't fulfilled. This could help her understand what went wrong and potentially prevent similar situations in the future.\n\nWhile demanding a refund is also a possibility, the primary focus in this scenario seems to be on the unfulfilled service rather than solely the financial aspect. The emphasis on the \"magic\" of matchmakers and Cecelia's belief in their abilities suggests a deeper emotional investment in finding love through this specific means. Therefore, confronting the matchmaker about the unfulfilled service appears to be the more likely initial reaction. \n",
