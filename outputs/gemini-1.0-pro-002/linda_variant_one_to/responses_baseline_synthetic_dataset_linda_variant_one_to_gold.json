The protagonist's interest in the car is evident from taking a selfie with it and posting it on Snapchat. Asking the owner for a ride could be a way to satisfy their curiosity and experience the car firsthand. \n\n**(b) The protagonist would likely ask the owner for a ride in the Mustang to show it off to friends.** \n\nThis option is also plausible. Sharing the experience with friends could amplify the excitement and enhance the social aspect of owning a classic car. \n\n## Determining the More Likely Option: \n\nBoth options are plausible and depend on the individual's personality and motivations. \n\n* If the protagonist is primarily driven by personal curiosity and a desire for a unique experience, option (a) might be more likely. \n* If the protagonist is more concerned with social validation and showing off, option (b) might be more likely. \n\nWithout further information about the protagonist's personality and motivations, it is impossible to definitively determine which option is more likely. \n\n## Conclusion: \n\nBoth options (a) and (b) are equally plausible, and the specific context and individual's motivations would determine the more likely scenario. \n",

This could lead to a loss of confidence and a desire to avoid similar situations in the future.\n* **Fear of further embarrassment:** The possibility of experiencing similar humiliation again could be a significant deterrent for Amelia. Even if she enjoys singing, the fear of public ridicule might outweigh the potential rewards of competing.\n* **Shift in focus:** The experience could lead Amelia to reconsider her priorities and focus on other areas of her life where she feels more comfortable and confident. \n\nWhile option (b) is a possibility, it seems less likely because it assumes that Amelia's primary motivation for competing was to avoid embarrassment. This may not be the case. She might have genuinely enjoyed singing and competing, and the blooper incident could simply lead her to be more cautious in choosing future competitions. \n\nUltimately, the most likely outcome depends on Amelia's individual personality and how she copes with the negative experience.

In these situations, it is common for individuals with autism to seek out a quiet, isolated space to calm down and regain control of their emotions. This allows them to regulate their emotions without causing disruptions or harm to others.\n\n**Option (b) also emphasizes the desire to avoid causing disruptions, but it does not explicitly mention the need to calm down, which is the primary reason why individuals with autism seek a quiet space.** Therefore, option (a) is the more likely scenario.",
