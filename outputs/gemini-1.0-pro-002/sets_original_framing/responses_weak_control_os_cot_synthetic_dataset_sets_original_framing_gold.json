(From research by Daily Mail)\n* A specific subset of vehicles is electric. (From research by Princeton University)\n\nThe conclusion is: \n\n* A subset of buses are electric.\n\n## Step 2: Check for validity. \n\nIs it true that if all buses are vehicles and a specific subset of vehicles is electric, then a subset of buses must be electric?\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the logic.\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premises. If all buses are vehicles, and some vehicles are electric, then it necessarily follows that some buses must be electric. \n\n## Conclusion:\n\nTherefore, the answer is **Yes**, the statement is logically sound.\n",
