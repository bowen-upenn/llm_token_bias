This statement is also **true**.\n3. **Conclusion:** Therefore, some buses are electric. This conclusion does not logically follow from the statements. \n\nThe conclusion is based on the assumption that all vehicles that are electric are buses. However, this is not necessarily true. There are many types of vehicles that are electric, such as cars, motorcycles, and trains. \n\nTherefore, the conclusion is not logically sound. It is possible that some buses are electric, but this cannot be concluded from the given statements. \n",
