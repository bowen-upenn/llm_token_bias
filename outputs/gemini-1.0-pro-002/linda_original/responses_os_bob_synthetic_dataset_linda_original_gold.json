Here's why:\n\n**Evidence supporting (a):**\n\n* **Creativity and analytical mind:** Alex's double major in computer science and fine arts shows a blend of creativity and analytical thinking, which aligns well with the role of a nurse anesthetist. This role requires both artistic precision for administering anesthesia and a deep understanding of the science behind it.\n* **Advocacy for inclusivity:** Alex's active advocacy for LGBTQ+ and racial equality, alongside their participation in workshops fusing technology and social advocacy, demonstrates a passion for social change and community engagement. This aligns with the potential involvement of a nurse anesthetist in advocating for improved healthcare access and advocating for inclusivity within the medical field.\n* **Interest in technology and art:** Alex's interest in digital art and coding, combined with their participation in technology-focused workshops, suggests a potential interest in applying technology to address social issues.
