His calm and patient demeanor might be a valuable asset in that role, and his interest in making a positive impact could translate into sustainable building practices. Moreover, collecting vintage stamps doesn't seem incompatible with his overall personality and interests.\n\nTherefore, both parts of option (b) seem plausible and not mutually exclusive, making it the more probable scenario compared to option (a) which focuses solely on his career as an architectural and engineering manager without mentioning his personal interest in stamp collecting. \n",
