This indicates a strong interest in her cultural roots and a desire to stay connected to them. \n* **Opposing evidence:** The information provided doesn't explicitly mention Shayla's involvement in a drum circle.\n\n**(b) Shayla is an audiologist and a member of a traditional Native American drum circle, where she connects with her heritage and shares cultural practices with others.**\n\n* **Supporting evidence:** We don't have information about Shayla's profession, but her passion for her culture and her desire to make a positive impact suggest she might choose a career that allows her to connect with her community and share her knowledge.\n* **Opposing evidence:** There is no mention of Shayla being an audiologist, and while her involvement in a drum circle suggests an interest in sharing cultural practices, it's not clear whether she does this professionally.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on the available information, we can conclude that **option (a)** is **more probable**. While option (b) is also plausible, the evidence directly supports Shayla's involvement in a traditional Native American drum circle based on her cultural interests and values. The lack of information about her profession makes option (b) less likely.\n\nHowever, it's important to remember that this is just an analysis based on the information provided.
