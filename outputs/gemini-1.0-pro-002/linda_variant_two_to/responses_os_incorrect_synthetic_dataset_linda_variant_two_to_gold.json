This aligns with Susan Rice's comments and the mention of a cease-fire not holding, suggesting that the arms sales are likely fueling the ongoing conflict. Additionally, option (b) provides a stronger link to the deaths reported in Syria, implying that the arms sales are contributing to the violence.\n\nTherefore, option (b) seems more likely based on the information provided in the prompt. Of course, it's important to note that this is a conclusion based on limited information and real-world events are often complex with multiple contributing factors.\n",
