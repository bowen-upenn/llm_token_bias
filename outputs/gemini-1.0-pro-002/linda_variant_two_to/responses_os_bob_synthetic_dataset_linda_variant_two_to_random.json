This option is more likely because the article doesn't mention anything about launching the first flight in three years, but it does say that the \"trip\" will be \"in a 'luxury capsule'. The luxury capsule implies they are taking steps to enhance their trip with exclusive offerings like a new coffee blend, making option (b) more probable.",

This detail suggests that the author is playing with the reader's expectations and trying to be deliberately funny.Additionally, the phrase \"bumbles and bobbles its momentum\" suggests that the story may not be perfect, which aligns with the more specific and humorous tone of option (b).",
