Chronic cholestasis can cause several symptoms, including:\n\n* **Loss of appetite:** This occurs due to reduced bile production and impaired digestion.\n* **Headaches:** These may be caused by the buildup of toxins in the bloodstream.\n* **Fatigue:** Chronic cholestasis can lead to ongoing fatigue due to impaired nutrient absorption.\n* **Abdominal pain:** This can occur due to inflammation and irritation of the bile ducts.\n* **Jaundice:** This is a yellowing of the skin and eyes caused by bilirubin buildup.\n* **Dark urine:** This is caused by the excretion of bilirubin in the urine.\n* **Pale stools:** This occurs due to the lack of bile pigments in the stool.\n* **Itching:** This can be caused by the buildup of bile salts in the skin.\n\nTherefore, experiencing both loss of appetite and frequent headaches is a more common presentation of Chronic cholestasis than just experiencing loss of appetite alone.\n",
