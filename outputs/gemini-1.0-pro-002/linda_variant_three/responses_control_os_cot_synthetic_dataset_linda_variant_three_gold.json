This option includes two events - sweating and breathlessness.\n\n**Option (b):** Sam experiences sweating. This option includes only one event - sweating.\n\nAccording to the conjunction fallacy, the probability of two events occurring together (sweating and breathlessness) is always less than or equal to the probability of either event occurring alone (sweating). \n\nTherefore, even though it's possible for Sam to experience both sweating and breathlessness, the scenario with just sweating (option b) is statistically more likely. This aligns with the fundamental rule of probability: the probability of a conjunction is always less than or equal to the probability of its individual components.\n\n**Therefore, the answer is (b).** \n",

Apply the conjunction fallacy:**\n\nOur intuition might lead us to believe that option (b) is more likely because experiencing both sweating and vomiting seems more indicative of a heart attack than just experiencing sweating. However, this is a classic example of the conjunction fallacy.\n\n**3. Remember the rule of probability:**\n\nThe probability of a conjunction (A and B) is always less than or equal to the probability of either individual event (A or B).
