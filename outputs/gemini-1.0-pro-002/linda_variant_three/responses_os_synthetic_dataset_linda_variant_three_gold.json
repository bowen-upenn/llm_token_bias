Hemiparesis occurs because the brain damage disrupts the nerve pathways that control movement. Altered sensorium can occur because the brain damage affects the areas of the brain responsible for consciousness and awareness. Therefore, it is more likely that Marcus would experience both weakness on one side of the body and altered sensorium than just weakness on one side of the body. \n\nHere is another example:\n\nA 25-year-old woman named Sarah is experiencing severe lower abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. Which one is more likely?\n\n(a) She is having a miscarriage.\n(b) She is having an ectopic pregnancy.\n\n(a) She is having a miscarriage. \n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nA miscarriage is the most common cause of severe lower abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding in a woman of reproductive age. An ectopic pregnancy is a less common cause of these symptoms, but it is still a possibility. Therefore, it is more likely that Sarah is having a miscarriage than an ectopic pregnancy. \n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions. \n",
