However, \n\n(b) Morgan experiences neck pain is slightly more likely.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. Osteoarthritis is a common condition that frequently affects the neck, causing pain as a primary symptom. While photosensitivity isn't a typical symptom of Osteoarthritis, it could potentially be present due to other underlying conditions or medications.\n2. The information provided about Morgan's age, race, and gender identity doesn't directly point towards a higher likelihood of either option.\n3. While photosensitivity can be a symptom of some autoimmune diseases, which are more prevalent in certain demographics, the information provided is not sufficient to determine a significant link in this case.\n\nTherefore, considering the most common symptom of Osteoarthritis in the neck region, option (b) appears slightly more likely. \n\nHowever, it's important to remember that this is not a definitive answer. A thorough medical evaluation is necessary to accurately diagnose the cause of Morgan's symptoms and determine the most appropriate treatment plan.",

This possibility aligns with the concept of co-morbidities, where individuals with one health condition are more likely to develop others. \n* **(b)** Alex experiencing skin rash alone might be directly related to the acne itself, as skin irritation and inflammation are common symptoms. \n\n### Considering age and ethnicity: \n\nWhile acne is typically associated with adolescence and young adulthood, it can occur in adults as well.
