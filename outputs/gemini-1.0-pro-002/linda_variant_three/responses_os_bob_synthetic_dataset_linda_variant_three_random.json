Forgetfulness is not typically associated with heart attacks.

While sweating is common, it doesn't happen in every case.\n* If you or someone you know experiences chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other potential heart attack symptoms, immediately seek medical attention.\n",

In fact, studies suggest that abnormal menstruation occurs in up to 50% of women with hyperthyroidism. \n\nIt's important to note that the absence of insomnia in this case does not rule out hyperthyroidism.
