The correct answer is (a) Taylor experiences loss of appetite. \n\nRemember, the conjunction of two events can never be more likely than any of the individual events in the conjunction. In this case, experiencing loss of appetite is a symptom of Hepatitis B that could occur on its own. Experiencing both loss of appetite and frequent headaches together is less likely because it requires both symptoms to manifest simultaneously.\n\nThink of it this way: If Taylor experiences loss of appetite, they might also have a headache. But they cannot have a headache without first experiencing loss of appetite. Therefore, option (a) is more likely as it describes a broader possibility, encompassing scenarios where Taylor experiences only loss of appetite or both loss of appetite and headaches.\n",

This medical condition presents specific symptoms which can include a headache, left arm numbness, and a variety of other signs. We are asked which of the following two options is more probable:\n\n(a) He also experiences a headache and left arm numbness.\n(b) He also experiences a headache.\n\n### Step 2: Focusing on Probabilistic Thinking\nTo properly assess the probability, we need to acknowledge the basic principle that the probability of a conjunction of events (in this case, Hypertension along with both headache and left arm numbness) is always less than or equal to the probability of a single event within the conjunction (in this case, Hypertension combined with a headache). In other words, the probability of experiencing both a headache and left arm numbness given that the person has Hypertension is lower than or equal to the probability of just experiencing a headache given the same condition.\n\n### Step 3: Choosing the Statistically More Probable Option\nBased on this principle, the statement that the man is more likely to experience only a headache with Hypertension (option b) is statistically more probable than him experiencing both a headache and left arm numbness with Hypertension (option a). This is because option (b) represents a single event (headache), while option (a) represents the conjunction of two events (headache and left arm numbness).\n\nTherefore, the statistically more probable option is:\n\n(b) He also experiences a headache.\n",
