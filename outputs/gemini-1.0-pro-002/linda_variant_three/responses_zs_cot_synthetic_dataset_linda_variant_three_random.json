It can lead to a buildup of bile acids in the bloodstream, causing various symptoms.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\n**(a) Loss of appetite and frequent headaches:** \n\n* **Loss of appetite** is a common symptom of chronic cholestasis. Bile acids can affect the way the body processes fats and nutrients, leading to a decreased appetite.\n* **Frequent headaches** are not a typical symptom of chronic cholestasis. While some individuals may experience headaches, it's not a defining feature. \n\n**(b) Loss of appetite:**\n\n* As mentioned above, loss of appetite is a common symptom of chronic cholestasis. \n\n## Conclusion:\n\nBased on the analysis, option (b) - **He experiences loss of appetite** - is more likely to occur in David's case. \n\nIt's important to note that individual experiences with chronic cholestasis can vary. While loss of appetite is a common symptom, other symptoms may also be present.

Symptoms of Hepatitis B:**\n\nBoth loss of appetite and headaches can be symptoms of Hepatitis B. However, **headaches are less common**:\n\n- **Loss of appetite:** 50-80% of patients experience loss of appetite. \n- **Headaches:** 10-40% of patients experience headaches.\n\n**2. Prevalence of symptoms:**\n\nEven though both symptoms can occur, **loss of appetite is more prevalent**. This means it affects a **higher percentage** of individuals with Hepatitis B. \n\n## Conclusion:\n\nBased on the higher prevalence of loss of appetite as a symptom of Hepatitis B, **option (b) is more likely**: \n\n**(b) Taylor experiences loss of appetite.**\n\n## Important note:\n\nThis analysis only considers the likelihood based on statistical information. It is crucial to remember that every individual experiences illness differently. Experiencing only loss of appetite does not rule out the possibility of headaches, and a healthcare professional should always be consulted for proper diagnosis and management. \n",

A proper diagnosis can only be made by a qualified medical professional after a thorough evaluation of the patient's symptoms, medical history, and physical examination.\n\nTherefore, it is highly recommended that the patient immediately seek medical attention to receive a proper diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. \n",
