Other factors like underlying health conditions, individual variations, and specific presentation of the disease may influence the actual outcome.\n- Consulting a medical professional for a proper diagnosis and personalized assessment remains crucial.",

According to the CDC, 32.5 million adults in the United States have arthritis. Therefore, the base rate of experiencing neck pain and swelling in the joints is higher than experiencing neck pain alone.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the impact of being African American\nWhile the prevalence of Osteoarthritis is similar across racial groups, some studies suggest that African Americans might experience a higher burden of the disease. This means they might have a greater chance of experiencing more severe symptoms like joint swelling.\n\n## Step 3: Conclusion\nCombining the base rate of experiencing neck pain and swelling in the joints with the possibility of a higher symptom burden for African Americans, it is more likely that Alex experiences both neck pain and joint swelling. \n",
