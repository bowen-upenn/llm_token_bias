        "init_model_answer": "(a) Pat experiences vomiting and yellowing of the eyes.  \n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes) is a common symptom of hepatitis A. This occurs because the liver is unable to properly process bilirubin, a waste product of red blood cells. Vomiting is also a common symptom of hepatitis A, as the virus can irritate the stomach and intestines. \n\nWhile it is possible for Pat to experience only vomiting as a symptom of hepatitis A, the combination of vomiting and yellowing of the eyes is more indicative of the disease. \n",

While loss of appetite alone can be a symptom, it is much more likely for someone with chronic cholestasis to experience both loss of appetite and abdominal pain. This is because the buildup of bile in the liver can cause inflammation and discomfort in the abdomen, leading to loss of appetite. Additionally, the liver plays a crucial role in digestion, and impaired liver function due to chronic cholestasis can further contribute to loss of appetite. \n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, it is more likely that John experiences both loss of appetite and abdominal pain rather than just loss of appetite alone. \n",
