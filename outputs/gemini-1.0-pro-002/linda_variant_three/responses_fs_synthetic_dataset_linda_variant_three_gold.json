This condition is more likely to cause both loss of appetite and abdominal pain than just loss of appetite alone. \n\nWhile loss of appetite is a common symptom of many conditions, abdominal pain is a more specific symptom that is often associated with liver problems like chronic cholestasis. \n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, it is more likely that John would experience both loss of appetite and abdominal pain as a result of his chronic cholestasis diagnosis. \n",

Option (b) adds an irrelevant detail about discussing environmental policies, making it less likely.\n\n**66-year-old man with UTI:**\n\n* **(a) He also experiences burning micturition and bladder discomfort.** This is more likely because experiencing both burning micturition and bladder discomfort are common symptoms of a UTI, especially in older men.

We need to determine which of the following is more likely:\n\n**(a) He also experiences headache and loss of balance.**\n**(b) He also experiences headache.**\n\nTo answer this accurately, we need to consider several factors:\n\n* **Hypertension symptoms:** While headache is a common symptom of high blood pressure, it's not the only one. Dizziness and loss of balance can also occur, especially during hypertensive crisis.\n* **Prevalence of symptoms:**  Headache alone is more prevalent than headache combined with loss of balance in hypertensive patients.\n* **Age and ethnicity:** Age and ethnicity can influence the presentation of Hypertension symptoms. Pacific Islanders might be more prone to specific symptoms due to genetic and environmental factors.\n\n**Based on these factors, option (b) \"He also experiences headache\" is more likely.** Headache is a frequent symptom of Hypertension, while loss of balance, though possible, is less common, especially if not accompanied by other neurological symptoms. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that this is a general conclusion based on available information.  Individual cases can vary, and a definitive diagnosis requires a complete medical evaluation.\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n\n*  The severity of Hypertension can influence the severity and type of symptoms experienced.\n*  Underlying medical conditions or medications can contribute to specific symptoms.\n\nTherefore, while option (b) seems statistically more likely, a thorough medical evaluation is crucial for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. \n",
