We need to determine which of the following options is more likely:\n\n**(a)** Morgan experiences neck pain and photosensitivity.\n\n**(b)** Morgan experiences neck pain.\n\n## Applying Probability Rules\n\nAccording to the principles of probability, the probability of event (a) (experiencing both neck pain and photosensitivity) can never be higher than the probability of event (b) (experiencing just neck pain). This is because event (a) is a more specific scenario and requires both conditions to be met, whereas event (b) only requires one condition to be met. \n\nTherefore, based on pure probability, **option (b), Morgan experiencing neck pain, is more likely.** \n\nThis conclusion holds true regardless of any additional information provided about Morgan, such as their age, race, gender identity, or medical diagnosis. While these factors might influence the individual probabilities of experiencing neck pain or photosensitivity, they don't change the fundamental relationship between the two events: the probability of experiencing both cannot exceed the probability of experiencing just one. \n\n## Avoiding the Conjunction Fallacy\n\nIt's important to remember that our initial intuitions might lead us to believe that option (a) is more likely due to the representativeness heuristic. We might imagine a specific scenario where Morgan's Osteoarthritis causes both neck pain and photosensitivity, making this combined event seem more likely. However, falling into this trap of the conjunction fallacy would be a mistake. \n\nBy focusing on the core principles of probability and ignoring extraneous details, we can arrive at the correct conclusion: **option (b), Morgan experiencing neck pain, is more likely.** \n",
