        "use_multi_agents": false,
        "init_model_answer": "(a) He experiences loss of appetite and frequent headaches.\n\n## Reasoning\n\nChronic cholestasis is a condition that affects the flow of bile from the liver. This can lead to a build-up of bile acids in the bloodstream, which can cause a variety of symptoms, including loss of appetite, frequent headaches, fatigue, and jaundice.\n\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic, loss of appetite is a common symptom of chronic cholestasis, and it is one of the most common symptoms of chronic cholestasis. The reason for this is that bile acids can irritate the lining of the stomach and intestines, making it difficult to eat. \n\nFrequent headaches are also a common symptom of chronic cholestasis. This is because bile acids can build up in the brain, which can cause inflammation and pain. \n\nTherefore, given that both loss of appetite and frequent headaches are common symptoms of chronic cholestasis, it is more likely that David would experience both of these symptoms than just loss of appetite.\n",
