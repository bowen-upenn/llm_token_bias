This can lead to a buildup of toxic substances in the liver, which can cause liver damage. Symptoms of chronic cholestasis can include loss of appetite, abdominal pain, fatigue, and jaundice.\n\nIn the given scenario, John is experiencing both loss of appetite and abdominal pain. These are two of the most common symptoms of chronic cholestasis. While it is possible that he might only be experiencing loss of appetite, the combination of both symptoms is more likely to be associated with chronic cholestasis. \n\nTherefore, considering the context and the specific symptoms John is experiencing, the answer is (a). \n",
