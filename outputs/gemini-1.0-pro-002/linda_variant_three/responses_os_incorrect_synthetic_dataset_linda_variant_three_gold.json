While headaches can be a symptom of hypertension, they are not the most common symptom. Loss of balance is not typically associated with hypertension. Therefore, it is more likely that the 45-year-old Pacific Islander man with hypertension would also experience headaches as a symptom.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n* Hypertension is a leading cause of heart disease, stroke, and kidney disease.\n* People of Pacific Islander descent are more likely to develop hypertension than other ethnic groups.\n* Lifestyle changes, such as a healthy diet and regular exercise, can help to control hypertension.\n* Medications may also be needed to treat hypertension.\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nI am not a medical professional, and this information should not be considered medical advice.

Impetigo is a skin infection characterized by blisters, pustules, and crusty sores. Therefore, the scenario mentioning \"skin rash and yellow crust ooze\" aligns more directly with the symptoms expected with Impetigo.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided: \n\n**(a) - Morgan also experience skin rash and yellow crust ooze** is more probable. \n\nThe appearance of the rash and yellow crusting are indicative symptoms of impetigo, making (b) less likely as it lacks this specific detail. \n\nIt is important to note, however, that without additional medical examination, it is impossible to definitively confirm either scenario.  \n",
