This aligns with common symptoms of hepatitis A, which include both vomiting and jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes). \n\nOption (b) states that Pat will only experience vomiting. While vomiting is a symptom of hepatitis A, it is not the only one. Additionally, other conditions can also cause vomiting, making it a less specific symptom for diagnosing hepatitis A.\n\n**Therefore, based on the information given, option (a) is more likely than option (b).**\n\n**Further considerations:**\n\nIt's important to remember that this answer is based on the limited information provided. A definitive diagnosis of hepatitis A would require consulting a medical professional and undergoing appropriate testing. \n\n**Additionally, please note that the information provided in this answer is for general knowledge purposes only and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice.

While anyone can get malaria, certain groups like young children, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems are more susceptible to severe illness. \n\n2. **High Fever:** High fever is a very common symptom of malaria, occurring in over 90% of cases. This makes option (b) a likely possibility.\n\n3. **Nausea:** Nausea is also a frequent symptom of malaria, although slightly less common than high fever, affecting around 70-80% of individuals. \n\n4. **Comparison:** Comparing the options, experiencing both high fever and nausea (a) is more specific than just experiencing high fever (b). While both are likely due to malaria, experiencing only high fever could also be caused by other conditions. \n\n5. **Conclusion:** Considering the high prevalence of both symptoms in malaria cases and the specificity of experiencing both, **option (a) is more likely.**  \n\nTherefore, the answer is **Yes**, Charles experiencing high fever and nausea is more likely than just experiencing high fever. \n",
