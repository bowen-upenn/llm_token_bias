However, experiencing **both** loss of appetite and itching might be slightly more likely, given that both symptoms are individually common in Hepatitis B cases, and their co-occurrence isn't statistically improbable. \n\nTherefore, although both options are possible, **(a)** appears slightly more likely. \n",

Additionally, some individuals may experience other symptoms like chest pain, nausea, or dizziness instead of sweating.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, **option (a) is more likely**.

We need to determine which option is more likely:\n\n**(a) Alex experiences neck pain and swelling in the joints.**\n\n**(b) Alex experiences neck pain.**\n\n## Analyzing the Information\n\nHere's what we know:\n\n* **Age:** Alex is 42 years old.\n* **Ethnicity:** Alex is African American.\n* **Medical Condition:** Alex is diagnosed with Osteoarthritis.\n\n## Considering the Likelihoods:\n\n**Neck Pain:**\n\n* Neck pain is **not a definitive symptom** of Osteoarthritis. While it can occur in some cases, particularly with cervical osteoarthritis, it is not as common as other symptoms, such as pain in weight-bearing joints like the knees, hips, and hands.\n\n**Swelling in Joints:**\n\n* **Swelling in the joints** is a much more **common symptom** of Osteoarthritis. It occurs due to inflammation and fluid buildup around the affected joints.\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n\n* Age and ethnicity are factors that can increase the risk of developing Osteoarthritis. African Americans and individuals over 40 are more likely to be diagnosed with the condition.\n\n## Conclusion:\n\nBased on the information provided, **option (a) is more likely.** \n\nAlex experiencing both neck pain and swelling in the joints aligns better with the typical symptoms of Osteoarthritis, considering his age, ethnicity, and the diagnosis itself. While neck pain alone is possible, the combination of neck pain and joint swelling points more strongly towards Osteoarthritis.\n\nHowever, it's important to remember that this is just a general analysis based on the limited information provided. A definitive diagnosis and identification of specific symptoms can only be made by a qualified medical professional through a thorough examination and investigation.",
