Since all buses are vehicles, and a subset of vehicles are electric, it stands to reason that some buses must also be electric. \n\nThis conclusion is a valid deductive inference based on the initial statements. \n",

This conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises. \n\nThe fact that some dishes are spicy doesn't guarantee that any stir fry, which is a specific type of dish, must be spicy. There could be stir fries that are not spicy. \n\nTherefore, the argument commits the fallacy of affirming the consequent. It incorrectly assumes that because some dishes have a certain characteristic (being spicy), all stir fries (which are a subset of dishes) must also have that characteristic. \n",
