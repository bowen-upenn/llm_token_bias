Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\n**Example:**\n\nAll cars are vehicles.\nSome vehicles are electric.\nTherefore, all cars are electric.\n\nThis is also a logically unsound statement because not all vehicles are cars. Electric cars are a subset of vehicles, but they are not the only type of electric vehicle.\n\n**Correct conclusion:**\n\nA more accurate conclusion would be:\n\nSome vehicles are buses.\nSome vehicles are electric.\nTherefore, some vehicles are both buses and electric.\n\nThis conclusion is consistent with the premises and avoids making an invalid generalization.",
