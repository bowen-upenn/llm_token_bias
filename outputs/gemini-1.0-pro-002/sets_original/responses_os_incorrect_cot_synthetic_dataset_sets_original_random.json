All pigs are classified as animals within the animal kingdom.\n\n2. **Is it true that a subset of animals are domesticated?**\n\nThis statement is also **true**. Humans have domesticated various animal species throughout history, creating a subset of animals that are dependent on humans for their survival.\n\n3. **Based on the previous statements, can we logically conclude that a subset of pigs are domesticated?**\n\nHere, the key is to analyze the relationship between the two statements. While all pigs are animals, not all animals are pigs. Therefore, the statement \"a subset of animals are domesticated\" doesn't necessarily imply anything specific about domesticated pigs. \n\nIt's important to note that some pig species have been domesticated, such as the widely known farm pigs. However, this information is not explicitly stated in the initial two statements. \n\nTherefore, based solely on the provided statements, we cannot conclusively say whether a subset of pigs are domesticated. \n\n## Conclusion:\n\n**No, the argument is not logically sound.** While the individual statements are true, they don't provide a direct and conclusive link to confirm the claim about domesticated pigs. \n",

Just because a subset of surfaces are made of marble, it doesn't automatically mean that a subset of **counter tops** specifically are made of marble. \n\nThe issue lies in the assumption that all surfaces are potential counter tops. This isn't the case.
