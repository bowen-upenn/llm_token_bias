In other words, if all chips are snacks and some snacks are high in salt, then some chips must be high in salt. \n\nThe argument is also sound because both premises are true. It is a known fact that all chips are snacks, and it is also true that some snacks are high in salt.

This is a valid deduction because it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false. \n\nThe argument is also sound because both premises are true. We know that all chips are snacks because this is a definition of the word \"chip.\" We also know that some snacks are high in salt because this is an empirical fact that has been observed and tested. \n\nTherefore, the argument is both valid and sound, making it a strong and convincing piece of reasoning. \n",
