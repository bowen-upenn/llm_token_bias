This means that there exists at least one animal that is domesticated.\n3. Combining these two premises, we can logically infer that some pigs must be domesticated.

Since all carrots are vegetables, and some vegetables are rich in fiber, it logically follows that some carrots must also be rich in fiber.\n\n## Analyzing the new question\n\n**Statement 1:** All actors are performers.\n**(True)** This statement is generally considered true. All individuals who participate in acting, regardless of medium, are considered performers.\n\n**Statement 2:** Some performers are skilled in improvisation.\n**(True)** This statement is also generally considered true. Many performers, including actors, comedians, and musicians, develop and refine improvisation skills throughout their careers.\n\n**Statement 3:** Therefore, some actors are skilled in improvisation.\n**(True)** Similar to the previous example, this statement is a valid conclusion based on the previous statements.
