He **becomes a favorite** among American politicians (which has its own probability).\n2. He **fails to ease tension** between the USSR and the USA (which also has its own probability).\n\nTherefore, the probability of option (b) is the product of the probabilities of both individual events:\n\n**P(b) = P(becomes favorite) * P(fails to ease tension)**\n\nThis product will always be **less than or equal to** the individual probabilities of either event alone.\n\nTherefore, based on pure probability, **option (a) is statistically more likely**:\n\n* **P(a) = P(becomes favorite)** is a single event with its own probability.\n* **P(b) = P(becomes favorite) * P(fails to ease tension)** is the conjunction of two events with a **lower or equal probability** than (a).\n\nThis conclusion aligns with our probabilistic thinking approach, emphasizing the importance of focusing on individual event probabilities rather than relying on intuitive, but statistically flawed, judgments.\n",

In simpler terms, it is more likely for one event to occur than for two events to occur simultaneously, especially when the second event (selling out stadiums) depends on the first event (charting) not happening.\n\nTherefore, based on pure probability, option (a) \u2013 the album not charting anywhere \u2013 is the more likely outcome.\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n\n* It's important to remember that this analysis is based solely on probability and does not consider other factors like the potential popularity of the album or the demand for concert tickets.\n* The actual outcome could be influenced by various external factors, making it difficult to predict with certainty.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy applying the principles of probabilistic thinking and ignoring extraneous information, we can conclude that option (a) \u2013 the album not charting anywhere \u2013 is the more likely outcome in this scenario. \n",

Additionally, the conjunction of two events is always less likely than the occurrence of a single event, as per the principle of the conjunction fallacy.\n\nTherefore, **(a)** is the statistically more probable option due to its focus on a single event and alignment with the principles of probability. \n",

Therefore, the single event (a) has a higher probability than the conjunction of events (b). \n\nIt's important to note that this analysis focuses purely on the probabilities of the events themselves, disregarding any additional information about Ayatollah Khomeini's political views or the potential content of the book.
