However, the second premise, \"some grains are gluten-free,\" does not necessarily imply that all grains are gluten-free. Furthermore, the conclusion, \"certain types of rices might be gluten-free,\" is based on an invalid inference.\n\nJust because some grains are gluten-free, it does not mean that all rices are gluten-free. Gluten-free grains are typically defined as grains that do not contain gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. Rice is not inherently gluten-free, as it can be processed and blended with gluten-containing grains. Therefore, it is not accurate to assume that certain types of rices might be gluten-free based solely on the fact that some grains are gluten-free.\n\nIn conclusion, the argument presented is not logically sound, and it is not safe to assume that certain types of rices are gluten-free without further evidence or certification. It is important to consult reliable sources and healthcare professionals for accurate information about gluten-free diets and grains.",

However, the unfounded study alleged by Gossip Gazette, which suggests that a subset of dishes are characterized by their spiciness, is not a reliable source of information. The study has not been verified, and there is no evidence to support the claim that a subset of dishes are spicy.\n\nFurthermore, even if we were to accept the unfounded study, the conclusion that a subset of fried chickens might also be spicy is a non-sequitur. Fried chicken is a specific dish that is not necessarily spicy, and there is no logical connection between fried chicken and spiciness.\n\nTherefore, the argument that a subset of fried chickens might be spicy is based on unreliable information and logical fallacies, making it not logically sound.",
