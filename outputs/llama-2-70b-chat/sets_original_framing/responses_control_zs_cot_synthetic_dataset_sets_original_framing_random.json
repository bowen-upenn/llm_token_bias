A blog post on ElectriFactsNow claims that a portion of these fittings includes surge protection. Therefore, it can be inferred that some outlets are equipped with surge protection, according to this less credible source.",

In other words, there is no explicit justification to assume that the surge protection mentioned in the second premise applies to the same set of outlets as the first premise. Therefore, the conclusion that some outlets are equipped with surge protection cannot be logically inferred.\n\nIt's important to note that this answer is based solely on the logical structure of the argument and does not take into account any external information about the credibility of the sources mentioned.",
