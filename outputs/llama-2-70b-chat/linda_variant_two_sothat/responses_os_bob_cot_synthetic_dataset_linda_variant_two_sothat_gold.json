However, it is important to approach the situation in a way that is respectful and constructive, and to avoid any actions that could be perceived as aggressive or provocative.",

France has been known to protect its cultural heritage and has implemented policies to maintain its unique identity in the face of globalization.

Therefore, Chinese netizens may use internet jokes or veiled references to discuss political topics, including critiques of the government, in a way that avoids direct censorship.\n\nIt's important to note that the use of internet jokes or coded language to discuss sensitive topics is not unique to China and can be seen in various forms across different cultures and social media platforms.",
