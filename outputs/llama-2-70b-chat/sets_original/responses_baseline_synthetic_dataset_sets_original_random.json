Therefore, a subset of paper clips are made of metal.\n\nThe conclusion follows logically from the premises. The first premise establishes that paper clips are a type of office supply. The second premise states that some office supplies are made of metal. The third premise logically concludes that some paper clips are made of metal.\n\nSo, the answer to the question is Yes, the argument is logically sound.",
