The first premise states that all outlets are electrical fittings, and the second premise states that some electrical fittings are surge-protected. By modus ponens (i.e., the principle of affirming the antecedent), we can conclude that some outlets are surge-protected.\n\nIt's important to note that this argument is logically sound, but it's not necessarily true. The conclusion relies on the accuracy of the premises, and if either premise is false, the conclusion will also be false. In this case, the argument is a syllogistic fallacy because it's based on an incomplete or inaccurate set of premises.
