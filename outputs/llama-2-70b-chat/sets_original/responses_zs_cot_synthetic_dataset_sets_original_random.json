Shorts are indeed a type of clothing.\n\n2. Premise 2: A subset of clothing items shrink when washed.\n\nThis premise is also true. Some clothing items, such as cotton or wool, can shrink in size when washed, especially if they are exposed to hot water or dry heat.\n\n3. Conclusion: Therefore, a subset of shorts shrink when washed.\n\nThis conclusion logically follows from the first two premises. Since shorts are a type of clothing, and a subset of clothing items shrink when washed, it makes sense that some shorts might also shrink when washed.\n\nSo, the argument is logically sound, and the conclusion is valid.
