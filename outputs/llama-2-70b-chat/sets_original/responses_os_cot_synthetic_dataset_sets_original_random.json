The first premise states that all roses are flowers, and the second premise states that some flowers fade quickly.

Garages are buildings.\n2. A subset of buildings have multiple stories.\n3. Therefore, a subset of garages have multiple stories.\n\nThe reasoning is also logically sound. The first premise states that garages are buildings, and the second premise states that a subset of buildings have multiple stories. The conclusion then logically follows that a subset of garages have multiple stories.\n\nHowever, similar to the first question, the conclusion is not necessarily true. Just because some buildings have multiple stories, it doesn't mean that some garages have multiple stories. Garages are typically designed to house cars, and they may not have the same structural requirements as other buildings.\n\nIn summary, both questions demonstrate logically sound reasoning, but the conclusions may not necessarily be true due to external factors that affect the premises.",
