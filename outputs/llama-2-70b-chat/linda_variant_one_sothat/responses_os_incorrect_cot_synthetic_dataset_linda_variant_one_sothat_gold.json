This is because Tom has already been pulled over and ticketed, and paying the ticket would allow him to avoid any additional penalties or legal issues related to the noise violation. Additionally, Tom's decision to continue using his new car stereo despite the noise violation suggests that he values the ability to listen to music while driving, and paying the ticket would allow him to continue doing so without worrying about further legal consequences.
