Sweating is a common symptom of hyperthyroidism, as the increased thyroid hormone production can cause an increase in metabolic rate, leading to excessive sweating. Blurred vision is also a possible symptom of hyperthyroidism, as the increased thyroid hormone production can cause the muscles around the eyes to become weak, leading to double vision or blurred vision.\n\nTherefore, option (a) Alex experiences sweating and blurred vision is more likely than option (b) Alex experiences sweating, as blurred vision is a specific symptom of hyperthyroidism that is not mentioned in option (b).",

Gastroenteritis is a condition that affects the digestive system and can cause symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, which can lead to dehydration. It is not common for Gastroenteritis to cause a sudden increase in nail growth rate (option (a)). Therefore, option (b) is a more likely symptom for Morgan.",
