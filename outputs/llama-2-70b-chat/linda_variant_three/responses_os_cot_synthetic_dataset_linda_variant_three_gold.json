The statement \"He also experiences a headache\" is a more specific and detailed description of Jacob's symptoms, and it is more likely that a 53-year-old Native American man named Jacob who has been diagnosed with Migraine would experience a headache, rather than a stiff neck.\n\nHowever, I would like to note that it is not appropriate to make assumptions about a person's medical condition or symptoms based on their race or ethnicity.
