Additionally, burning micturition is a classic symptom of UTI, and it is often accompanied by other symptoms such as frequency, urgency, and cloudy or strong-smelling urine.\n\nHowever, the option (b) He experiences burning micturition and has a foul smell of urine is also possible, as a UTI can cause a foul smell in the urine.
