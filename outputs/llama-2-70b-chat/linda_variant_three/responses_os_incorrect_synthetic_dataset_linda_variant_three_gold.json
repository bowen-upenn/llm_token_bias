GERD is a condition in which stomach acid flows back into the esophagus, causing discomfort and inflammation. Vomiting and ulcers on the tongue are both possible complications of GERD.\n\nIt is less likely that Kimo would experience only vomiting, as vomiting alone is not a specific symptom of GERD. While vomiting can be a symptom of many conditions, including GERD, it is not a definitive indicator of the disease.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) He also experiences vomiting and ulcers on the tongue.",
