Additionally, it's important to avoid making assumptions or generalizations about people based on their race or ethnicity.\n\nNow, to answer your question, I would choose option (b) Mark experiences fatigue.

While it's possible that Carlos may have these symptoms, we need to consider whether they are more likely to occur together or separately.\n\nOption (b) states that Carlos also has sunken eyes.

However, we can consider some general principles of probability to help us make a decision.\n\nWhen considering the conjunction of two events (in this case, gastroenteritis and sunken eyes), the probability of the conjunction is generally lower than the probability of either event occurring alone. This is because the conjunction requires both events to occur together, which is less likely than either event occurring separately.\n\nTherefore, based on this principle, it's possible that option (b) may be more likely, as it only requires the presence of sunken eyes, which may be more common than the combination of sunken eyes and headaches.

Other conditions can also cause these symptoms, so it's important to consult with a medical professional to confirm a diagnosis.\n\nTherefore, I would say that both options (a) and (b) are possible, but it's important to consider other factors and consult with a medical professional to confirm a diagnosis.

In this case, we are asked to consider the probability of John experiencing depression and tinnitus, given that he has been diagnosed with migraines.\n\nTo answer this question, we need to consider the base rates of each event. The base rate of migraines is relatively high, affecting about 12% of the population. The base rate of depression is also relatively high, affecting about 10% of the population. The base rate of tinnitus is lower, affecting about 5% of the population.\n\nNow, let's consider the conjunction of these events.
