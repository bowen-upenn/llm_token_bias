Which is more likely?\n\n(a) James would likely replace his toothbrush regularly.\n(b) James would likely replace his toothbrush regularly to ensure that it always remained effective at preventing cavities.\n\nThe correct answer is (a) James would likely replace his toothbrush regularly.\n\nIt is likely that James would replace his toothbrush regularly because he cares about his teeth and wants to keep them clean and healthy. Brushing teeth regularly, especially after consuming sugary foods like candy, is an important part of oral hygiene. Additionally, having ten toothbrushes suggests that James has a strong commitment to his oral health and is likely to take good care of his teeth.\n\nIt is not necessarily true that James would replace his toothbrush regularly to ensure that it always remained effective at preventing cavities. While replacing a toothbrush regularly can help prevent cavities, it is not the only factor that determines the effectiveness of a toothbrush in preventing cavities. Other factors, such as the type of toothbrush, the bristle size, and the frequency of brushing, also play a role. Therefore, option (b) is not necessarily true and is not the best answer.",

The fact that he bought a helmet and chaps suggests that he is serious about motorcycling and intends to continue riding. Additionally, the fact that he has been dreaming of buying a motorcycle suggests that he has a strong interest in motorcycling and is likely to continue pursuing this hobby.\n\nIt is less likely that the protagonist would be celebrating his recent retirement because there is no mention of him being retired in the passage. It is possible that he may be retired, but without further information, it is impossible to say for certain. Therefore, option (a) is the more likely choice.",
