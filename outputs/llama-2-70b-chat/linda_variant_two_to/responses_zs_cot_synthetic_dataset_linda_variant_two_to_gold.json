This suggests that they may be prioritizing policies that align with Warren's platform, which often focuses on issues related to economic inequality, healthcare, and consumer protection.\n\nGiven this context, it is more likely that progressives in Congress are expecting significant battles with Republicans to defend their priorities, rather than specifically to maintain federal funding for social programs. This is because Warren's platform often emphasizes addressing the root causes of economic inequality, rather than simply maintaining the status quo of existing social programs.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) They're expecting significant battles with Republicans to defend their priorities.",
