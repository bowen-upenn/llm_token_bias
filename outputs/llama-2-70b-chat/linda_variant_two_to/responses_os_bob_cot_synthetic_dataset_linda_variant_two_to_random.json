        "init_model_answer": " Based on the information provided, it is more likely that:\n\n(a) IPCC says it is more certain than ever that humans are causing temperature rises.\n\nThis is because the U.N. Secretary-General's statement and the U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's statement both suggest a sense of urgency and concern about the impact of human activities on the environment. Additionally, the U.N.'s call for the elimination of greenhouse gas emissions by 2100 aligns with the IPCC's message that humans are causing temperature rises.\n\nIt is important to note that the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) is a scientific body that provides objective and evidence-based assessments of climate change. Their statements are based on extensive research and data analysis, and are widely recognized as authoritative and reliable. Therefore, it is unlikely that the IPCC would make a statement that is not supported by scientific evidence, such as the claim that humans are causing temperature rises to increase local tourism in coastal areas.",

It would not be a new or notable event for the President to discuss.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"Obama will travel to Michigan on Wednesday to discuss new strategies in chess education\" is a more plausible scenario, as chess education has been a growing interest in recent years, and Michigan has been actively promoting STEM education. It is possible that the President might visit the state to discuss new initiatives or strategies in this area.\n\nTherefore, option (b) is a more likely scenario than option (a).",

This decline could be due to various factors, including increased access to birth control, sex education, and economic changes.\n\nThe statement \"MTV's '16 and Pregnant' may encourage teens to use birth control\" suggests that the show may have a positive impact on teenagers' behavior, encouraging them to use contraceptives and make informed decisions about their reproductive health.\n\nTherefore, option (a) \"Part of the decline can be attributed to the recession, expert says\" is a more likely explanation for the decline in teen births, as it suggests that economic factors may have played a role in the decline, rather than the influence of a television show.\n\nIt's important to note that this answer is not necessarily definitive, and there may be other factors that have contributed to the decline in teen births that are not mentioned in the question.",

Additionally, it is reasonable to assume that the leaders of Botswana would have a consistent stance on election outcomes in nearby countries, especially if they are concerned about the potential impact on regional stability.\n\nTherefore, option (a) is the more likely choice.",
