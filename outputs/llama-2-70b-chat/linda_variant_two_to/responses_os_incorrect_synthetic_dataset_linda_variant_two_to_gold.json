Therefore, I cannot answer the question as it is not based on factual information.\n\nIt's important to note that DNA evidence can be used to solve crimes years after the fact, and it's not uncommon for DNA samples to be stored in databases for extended periods of time. However, without more information about the specific case, it's impossible to say whether option (a) or (b) is more likely.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that the article you've referenced is from 2009, and DNA technology and databases have evolved significantly since then. The Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) is a national DNA database that allows law enforcement agencies to compare DNA samples from crime scenes and individuals. The database has helped solve many crimes, including cold cases, and has been instrumental in bringing justice to victims and their families.\n\nIn any case, it's important to remember that DNA evidence is just one tool that law enforcement agencies use to solve crimes, and it's not always possible to solve a case based solely on DNA evidence. A thorough investigation that includes collecting and analyzing all available evidence, as well as interviewing witnesses and potential suspects, is often necessary to solve a crime.",

The decline in teen births is a complex issue that can be attributed to a combination of factors, including improved access to education, increased use of birth control, and changes in societal attitudes towards teen pregnancy.\n\nComprehensive sex education in schools is a proven way to reduce teen pregnancy rates, as it provides young people with accurate information about sexual health and relationships, as well as skills to make informed decisions about their sexual health. Additionally, the recession may have also played a role in the decline in teen births, as economic uncertainty can lead to a decrease in fertility rates.\n\nTherefore, option (b) is the most likely answer.",
