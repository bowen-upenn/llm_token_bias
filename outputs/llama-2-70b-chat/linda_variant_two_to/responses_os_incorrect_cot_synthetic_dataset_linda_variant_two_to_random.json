        "init_model_answer": " Based on the information provided, it is more likely that progressives in Congress see Elizabeth Warren as their leader and are expecting significant battles with Republicans to defend their priorities (a). This is because Elizabeth Warren has been a prominent figure in the Democratic Party and has been a vocal advocate for progressive policies, particularly in the areas of economic inequality and consumer protection. Additionally, the question mentions that the midterm election has prompted a backlash from progressives, which suggests that they are looking for a leader who can effectively champion their causes.\n\nIt is less likely that progressives in Congress are expecting significant battles with Republicans to promote a new national anthem (b). While there may be some debate around the national anthem, it is not a priority issue for progressives in the current political climate. Moreover, promoting a new national anthem is not a realistic or feasible goal for progressives in Congress, given the political divisions and the lack of support from Republicans.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (a) They're expecting significant battles with Republicans to defend their priorities.",

In order to press charges, a grand jury must find probable cause, which means that there is sufficient evidence to believe that a crime has been committed and that the accused was involved. To organize a community outreach program, it would be more appropriate to have a community meeting or town hall, where members of the community can come together to discuss their concerns and ideas for improving community-police relations.\n\nIt's important to note that the grand jury's decision is not a final verdict, and it's up to the prosecutor to decide whether or not to bring charges against Darren Wilson. Additionally, it's important to remember that Michael Brown's death is a tragedy that has sparked important conversations about systemic racism and police brutality, and it's important to continue to have these conversations and work towards creating a more just and equitable society.",

The flight was carrying 58 people, which is a relatively small number of passengers compared to the capacity of a typical commercial airliner. Additionally, the fact that the flight was heading to an island suggests that it was likely a regional or domestic flight, rather than an international flight. Kinmen is a small island located off the coast of Taiwan, and it is possible that the flight was heading there for a cultural festival or other local event.\n\nIt is important to note that option (a) is not impossible, but based on the information provided, it is less likely than option (b). It is always important to consider the context and available information when making assumptions or drawing conclusions.",

Based on the information provided, it seems that Botswana's government is concerned about the potential negative impact of the situation in Ivory Coast on peace and security in Africa. Therefore, option (a) seems more likely, that the leaders of Botswana also opposed the outcome of Zimbabwe's elections two years ago. This suggests that Botswana's government has a history of taking a stand against election outcomes that they believe could negatively impact regional stability.\n\nHowever, without further information, it's difficult to say for certain why the leaders of Botswana opposed the outcome of Zimbabwe's elections two years ago. It's possible that they had concerns about the fairness or transparency of the election process, or that they believed the outcome could have negative implications for Zimbabwe's stability and prosperity.\n\nIt's worth noting that option (b), that the leaders of Botswana opposed the outcome of Zimbabwe's elections two years ago to improve their culinary skills, is not a plausible explanation. It's unlikely that a country's government would oppose an election outcome for such a reason, and it's not clear how opposing an election outcome would help improve culinary skills.",
