Is wider inclusiveness necessary for the economic system, and if so, is it sufficient to support the international space program?\n\nWithout additional information, it's difficult to answer these questions definitively.

The economic system has been criticized for various reasons, such as income inequality, lack of access to education and healthcare, and environmental degradation. This suggests that the economic system might be faulty in some aspects.\n2. Wider inclusiveness can benefit the economy by bringing in diverse perspectives, skills, and innovation. However, whether this is sufficient to support the international space program depends on various factors, such as the program's funding, resources, and goals.\n\nConsidering these factors, it's challenging to definitively say which option is more likely.
