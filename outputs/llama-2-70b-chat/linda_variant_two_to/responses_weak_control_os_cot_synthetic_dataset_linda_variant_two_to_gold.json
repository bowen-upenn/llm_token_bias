The probability of this event is unknown, but it is likely to be low, as there are many talented actresses who could potentially play this role, and Chlo\u00eb Sevigny may not be the only one considered for the part.\n\nOption (b) Demi's Lovelace role is rumoured to be filled by Chlo\u00eb Sevigny to co-star with Ryan Gosling in her next blockbuster film: This option adds additional information that Chlo\u00eb Sevigny will not only play the role of Demi Lovelace but will also co-star with Ryan Gosling in her next blockbuster film.

Given that four people in the car were killed, including a 12-year-old, it is likely that the car was struck by the train. If the car was struck by the train, it is unlikely that any passengers on the train would have been injured, as the train would have had time to stop or slow down before impact.

When evaluating the probability of a conjunction, we need to consider the probability of each individual event and the probability of their intersection (i.e., the probability that both events occur together).\n\nIn this case, we know that the pilot's training met FAA requirements, as stated in the Monday report. Therefore, the probability of the first event (a) is 100%.\n\nThe second event (b) is more uncertain, as we don't have enough information to determine the probability of the airline ensuring that all safety protocols were strictly followed. However, we can assume that the airline takes safety seriously and has a strong safety culture, which suggests that the probability of the second event (b) is not zero.\n\nTherefore, the probability of the conjunction (b) is the product of the probabilities of the individual events (a) and (b), which is 100% x (some positive probability less than 100% but not zero) = some positive probability less than 100%.\n\nSince the probability of the conjunction (b) is less than 100%, it means that option (a) is more likely than option (b).

The second scenario, on the other hand, adds an additional condition that the children became successful and independent adults, which may not be directly related to Denuta's feeling of neglect. Therefore, option (a) seems more likely to me.\n\nHowever, I would like to point out that this question may be problematic because it could be interpreted as perpetuating harmful gender stereotypes.

The statement \"Netanyahu tells Israeli lobby that Jewish building in East Jerusalem will continue\" suggests that the Israeli government is committed to continuing the construction plans in East Jerusalem, despite the strained relations with the US. The statement \"Hillary Clinton says U.S. will also continue to rebuke Israel when necessary\" implies that the US will continue to express its disagreement with Israel's construction plans, but it does not necessarily mean that Israeli ties will be negatively affected.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, it seems more likely that Israeli ties will continue, despite the ongoing disagreements over construction plans. Therefore, the answer is (a) Israeli ties.\n\nIt's important to note that this question is designed to test our ability to avoid the conjunction fallacy, which is the tendency to overestimate the probability of a conjunction of two events, even if the probability of each event separately is low. In this case, the question asks us to consider the probability of both Israeli ties and the negative impact of the construction plans on those ties. We need to be careful not to overestimate the probability of the conjunction of these two events and instead consider each event separately before making our decision.",

This is a reasonable statement, as both games are known to be graphically intensive and could benefit from larger screens.\n\nOption (b) states that games taking advantage of screen size will include Vainglory and Asphalt 8, and will feature exclusive gameplay enhancements. This statement is less likely, as it implies that the games will not only be optimized for larger screens but will also have additional features that are not available on smaller screens.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (a) Games taking advantage of screen size will include Vainglory, Asphalt 8.",

This suggests that there may be a higher likelihood of fans attempting to visit Michael Jackson's grave, which could lead to the funeral company implementing stringent security patrols to protect the site.\n\nHowever, without further information, it's difficult to say with certainty which option is more likely. It's possible that the funeral company has stringent security patrols in place for all graves, not just Michael Jackson's, in order to maintain the privacy and dignity of all the deceased.\n\nTherefore, I would say that neither option (a) nor option (b) is more likely, as both are possible based on the information provided. It's important to gather more information before making a conclusion.\n\nI hope this response is helpful and respectful. Please let me know if you have any further questions.",

It is a general statement that could be said by anyone who is feeling devastated, regardless of the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, option (b) includes the additional detail that Mickey Harte is speaking to a group of reporters after hearing the news. This adds a specific context and audience to the statement, which may influence the likelihood of the statement being made. However, without additional information, it is not possible to say whether this context and audience would make the statement more or less likely.\n\nTherefore, I believe that option (a) is more likely, as it is a more general and context-independent statement.",
