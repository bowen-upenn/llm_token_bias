Here's my answer:\n\n(a) Games taking advantage of screen size will include Vainglory, Asphalt 8.\n\nThis is a more likely scenario because the larger screens on the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus will allow for a more immersive gaming experience, and games like Vainglory and Asphalt 8 are designed to take advantage of larger screens. Additionally, it's reasonable to assume that game developers will optimize their games for the new iPhone screens to provide a better gaming experience for users.\n\nIt's important to note that the assumption in the question that games will be optimized for the new iPhone screens is not necessarily true, and it's possible that some games may not take full advantage of the larger screens. However, based on the information provided, it's more likely that games like Vainglory and Asphalt 8 will be optimized for the larger screens.",
