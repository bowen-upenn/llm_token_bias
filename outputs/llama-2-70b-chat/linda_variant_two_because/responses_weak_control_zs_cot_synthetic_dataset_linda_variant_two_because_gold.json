While it's true that presidents often travel to various events, including campaign rallies, it's not necessarily the case that taxpayers always foot the bill for these trips. In some instances, the campaign or the political party might cover the costs.\n\n(b) This option, on the other hand, adds an additional reason why taxpayers might pay for the president's travel to campaign events: the perceived importance of maintaining public approval and visibility for the president. While it's true that presidents often seek to maintain a high level of public approval, it's not necessarily the case that they would use taxpayer funds to do so.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: Which is more likely?\n\nIn my judgment, neither option is more likely, as both are hypothetical scenarios that might or might not occur, depending on various factors. It's important to note that the question is trying to trick us into falling for the conjunction fallacy by presenting two options that might seem plausible but are not necessarily mutually exclusive.\n\nTherefore, my answer is: Neither (a) nor (b) is more likely, as both options are hypothetical and not necessarily grounded in factual evidence.

While it is possible that the outbreak has killed over 1,100 people, it is important to note that the lack of recent history of cholera outbreaks in Haiti may suggest that the country's healthcare system and infrastructure may not be adequately prepared to handle such an outbreak.\n\n(b) The epidemic has killed more than 1,100 in the earthquake-ravaged nation because it is spreading rapidly and the healthcare system is already overwhelmed.\n\nThis option takes into account the fact that Haiti's healthcare system may be overwhelmed due to the recent earthquake, which could contribute to the rapid spread of the disease.
