It is understandable that Israel would be concerned about any aid provided to Gaza potentially bolstering Hamas, which is a terrorist organization. It is important to note that providing aid to a region does not necessarily mean that it will directly benefit a terrorist organization, and it is important to consider the potential humanitarian benefits of such aid. However, it is also important to consider the potential risks and ensure that any aid provided does not violate existing sanctions or support harmful activities.",

Taxpayers also pay for travel to campaign events that rally support rather than raise money because of the perceived importance of maintaining public approval and visibility for the president.\n\nThe answer is (b) because it provides a reason for why taxpayers might pay for campaign travel that doesn't involve raising money. The perceived importance of maintaining public approval and visibility for the president could justify the use of taxpayer funds for campaign events that rally support, even if they don't directly raise money.\n\nTherefore, the answer is Yes, the reasoning in the second question is logically sound.",

The State Department has a rigorous process for designating terrorist organizations, and it is not influenced by political considerations.\n\nRegarding the GOP attacks on Clinton, it is possible that they are motivated by a desire to weaken her for her possible 2016 presidential run.
