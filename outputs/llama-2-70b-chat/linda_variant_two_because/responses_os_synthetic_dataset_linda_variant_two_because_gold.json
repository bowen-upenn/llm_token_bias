The majority of food stamp recipients are already working, but their jobs do not pay enough for them to afford basic necessities.\n\nTherefore, option (b) is the more likely answer as it acknowledges the misinformation surrounding food stamps and emphasizes the need for compassion and courage to improve the program, which includes incentives and job training, to support those who are struggling to make ends meet.",

The fact that G.L. Watson & Co. is bound to tight confidentiality agreements about its projects suggests that the company takes the privacy and security of its clients' information seriously, which could contribute to the length of time it takes to complete a project. Additionally, the restoration of a 1930s vessel like the Nahlin would likely require a high level of craftsmanship and attention to detail, which could also contribute to the longer completion time.",

        "init_model_answer": " The correct answer is (a) policy gives Cubans space to decide own best interests.\n\nThis answer is more likely because the statement by Louis Perez suggests that the change in U.S. policy towards Cuba is a positive step towards recognizing the country's national sovereignty and allowing the Cuban people to determine their own best interests. The phrase \"removes Cuban leadership pretext for 'moral authority' in face of U.S. hostility\" suggests that the previous U.S. policy of hostility towards Cuba was seen as a barrier to the country's ability to make its own decisions and assert its own interests. By removing this barrier, the U.S. policy change gives Cubans the space to decide their own best interests.\n\nOption (b) is not necessarily true and is not supported by the statement by Louis Perez. While it is true that people tend to prioritize their own interests and values, this does not necessarily mean that the Cuban people will automatically prioritize their own interests and values over the interests and values of other countries. The statement by Louis Perez suggests that the change in U.S. policy is a positive step towards recognizing the sovereignty of Cuba and allowing the Cuban people to determine their own best interests, rather than imposing the interests and values of other countries on them.",

The fact that a winter storm warning is in effect for the Sierra Nevada and that isolated mudslides have already occurred following heavy rains, suggests that the soil is already saturated and that the risk of further mudslides is increased. Therefore, option (b) is the most probable outcome.",
