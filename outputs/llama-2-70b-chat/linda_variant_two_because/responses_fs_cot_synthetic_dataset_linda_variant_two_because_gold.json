Which is more likely?\"\n\nThe options are:\n\n(a) 5% certain they are alive\n(b) 5% certain they are alive because they were not in the targeted location during the airstrikes.\n\nTo answer this question, we need to consider the information provided and the probability of each option being true.\n\nOption (a) suggests that the official is 99% certain that the top Khorasan members are alive, which means that there is only a 1% chance that they are not alive. This option does not take into account any additional information about the situation, and therefore, it is not a very likely scenario.\n\nOption (b) suggests that the official is 99% certain that the top Khorasan members are alive because they were not in the targeted location during the airstrikes. This option takes into account the information provided in the question that the reports said top Khorasan members had been hit, but the official now says that they are alive. This option also considers the possibility that the members might have been in a different location during the airstrikes, which makes it a more likely scenario.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (b) 5% certain they are alive because they were not in the targeted location during the airstrikes.",

The description of Linda's personality and interests does not suggest that she is likely to be active in the feminist movement, and therefore option (b) is less probable.\n\nFor the second question, the correct answer is (a) They started dating in 2006, and the Brazilian model is the mother of his two children. This option is more probable because it is a more straightforward and logical scenario, and there is no information to suggest that the Brazilian model is intelligent and caring, which would make her a great partner in life.\n\nAs for the third question, the correct answer is (b) Jasmine is a mortician, undertaker, or funeral arranger.

It is a clear and concise statement that does not include any additional information or context.\n\nOn the other hand, statement (b) is an altered version of the original quote, which includes an added phrase \"because it aligns with our commitment to transparency and accountability.\" This added phrase is not present in the original quote and is not a direct quote from Tony Hayward.

A man and a woman being treated for broken hands said they were tortured. Which is more likely?\n\nThe answer is (b) Mugabe laughed and mugged for reporters as he cast his ballot at a high school because they believed his supporters were more likely to engage in violent acts.\n\nThis answer is more likely because it aligns with the information provided in the question. The fact that some of Tsvangirai's supporters were taken to \"torture bases\" and were tortured suggests that there was a level of violence and intimidation involved in the election. Mugabe's actions, as described in option (b), suggest that he was confident in his supporters' ability to engage in violent acts and that he was trying to project an image of strength and control. This behavior is consistent with the idea that his supporters were more likely to engage in violent acts.\n\nIt's important to note that this question is based on a specific context and is not a generalization. It's also important to recognize that this question does not imply that all supporters of Mugabe were violent or that all supporters of Tsvangirai were peaceful. The question is simply asking which scenario is more likely based on the information provided.",
