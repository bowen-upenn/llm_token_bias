In this case, the question asks which scenario is more likely:\n\n(a) A later MRI scan revealed Mr Green had a severe neck injury.\n(b) A later MRI scan revealed Mr Green had a severe neck injury because he wore mismatched socks that day.\n\nTo answer this question, we need to consider the probability of each scenario occurring separately, as well as the probability of the conjunction of the two events.\n\nScenario (a) is a straightforward statement that Mr Green had a severe neck injury, without any additional information. The probability of this scenario occurring is difficult to determine without more information, but it is likely to be low, as neck injuries are not extremely common.\n\nScenario (b), on the other hand, is a conjunction of two events: Mr Green had a severe neck injury, and he wore mismatched socks that day. The probability of Mr Green wearing mismatched socks that day is relatively high, as people often wear mismatched socks without any negative consequences. The probability of Mr Green having a severe neck injury is also relatively low, as neck injuries are not extremely common.\n\nHowever, the conjunction of these two events is highly unlikely, as there is no logical connection between wearing mismatched socks and sustaining a severe neck injury. Therefore, the probability of scenario (b) is lower than the probability of scenario (a).\n\nIn conclusion, based on the information provided, it is more likely that Mr Green had a severe neck injury (scenario (a)) than that he had a severe neck injury because he wore mismatched socks that day (scenario (b)).\n\nI hope this answer helps to clarify the concept of the conjunction fallacy, and please let me know if you have any further questions!",
