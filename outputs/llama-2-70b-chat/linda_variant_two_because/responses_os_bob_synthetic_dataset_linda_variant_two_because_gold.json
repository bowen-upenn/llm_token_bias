Based on the information provided, the correct answer is (b) Obamacare does not require hospitals to use electronic medical records because the 2009 economic stimulus package provided funding for the health care industry to upgrade their technology.\n\nIt's important to note that the 2009 economic stimulus package, also known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), included provisions for the adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) and other health information technology (IT) improvements. The ARRA provided financial incentives for healthcare providers to adopt EHRs, which helped to increase the adoption rate of EHRs in the United States.\n\nHowever, it's worth mentioning that while the ARRA encouraged the adoption of EHRs, it did not require hospitals to use electronic medical records.

This is because the group still controls large territory and attracts support, despite President Obama's pledge to destroy it. In order to properly coordinate operations and combat the threat, it is important for the military to be located near the front lines, where they can gather intelligence, provide support to local forces, and launch targeted attacks. This approach has been effective in other military campaigns and is consistent with the U.S.'s strategy to defeat ISIS.",

By having the option to purchase fewer cigarettes at a time, smokers may be more likely to cut down on their smoking or switch to a lower-nicotine option. This idea is consistent with Sindelar's role as a tobacco control researcher and her interest in finding ways to reduce the harm caused by tobacco products.\n\nIt's worth noting that option (a) is not necessarily false, but it doesn't directly relate to the context of Sindelar's statement. While it's possible that some people might interpret the phrase \"pack-a-day smoker\" differently if smaller packs become available, the primary focus of Sindelar's statement seems to be on the potential benefits of offering smaller packs for those who are trying to quit or reduce their smoking habit.",

Additionally, the statement mentions that a tribute is expected at Sunday night's Grammy Awards, which further suggests that Aretha Franklin has passed away.\n\nIt is important to note that addiction is a serious issue that affects many people, and it is not appropriate to make assumptions or speculate about someone's personal struggles without evidence.

The town's popularity among tourists suggests that it has a range of amenities and activities that cater to different interests and preferences. Additionally, the fact that Buzios is a popular destination for tourists seeking both relaxation and entertainment supports the idea that it offers a variety of options for both.\n\nOn the other hand, option (a) is not necessarily true. While Ilha Grande is a tropical island, there is no information provided that suggests that it is known for its nightlife or entertainment options. In fact, the question states that no cars are allowed on the island, which suggests that it may be a more secluded or natural destination.
