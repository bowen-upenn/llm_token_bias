This is a more plausible explanation than the claim that a single \"shooter\" was responsible for the killing, as it is unlikely that one person could have successfully carried out such a complex and high-stakes operation alone. Additionally, Bergen's statement suggests that there may be doubts about the accuracy of the \"shooter's\" account of the raid, which further supports the idea that the killing was a team effort.",
