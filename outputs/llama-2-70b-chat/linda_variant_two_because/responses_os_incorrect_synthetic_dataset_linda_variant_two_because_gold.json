While some of these events may also serve as fundraising opportunities, it is generally accepted that taxpayers foot the bill for the president's travel expenses, including those incurred during campaign events. This is because the president's visibility and public approval are considered important for the effective functioning of the government and the success of their policies.\n\nTherefore, option (b) is the more likely scenario, as it aligns with the common practice of presidents using taxpayer-funded travel to campaign and maintain public support.",
