Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer. However, option (a) seems more plausible because it is common for politicians to address pressing issues that are of concern to the public, such as the economy and national security. In contrast, option (b) implies that the public is more interested in the President's personal admission of responsibility than in these broader issues, which may not be accurate.\n\nIt is important to avoid spreading misinformation or engaging in speculation. Therefore, it is essential to rely on credible sources and fact-check information before sharing it. Additionally, it is crucial to avoid making assumptions or jumping to conclusions without sufficient evidence. Instead, it is better to focus on providing accurate and helpful information that is grounded in verifiable sources.",
