However, I can provide some context and statistics related to Saul \"Canelo\" Alvarez's past performances.\n\nCanelo is a highly skilled and accomplished boxer, known for his impressive track record and consistency in the ring. He has won 53 of his 57 professional fights, with 36 of those wins coming by way of knockout. Canelo has only lost twice in his career, with his most recent loss being a unanimous decision against Floyd Mayweather Jr. in 2013.\n\nGiven Canelo's history of success and his reputation as one of the best boxers in the world, it's difficult to predict with certainty whether he will lose his next fight or not. However, it's worth noting that boxing is a highly competitive sport, and upsets can happen even for the best fighters.\n\nTherefore, I would say that both options (a) and (b) are possible, but it's important to keep in mind that Canelo's past performances suggest that he is a formidable opponent who is capable of winning at a high level. Ultimately, the outcome of Canelo's next fight will depend on various factors, including his training, preparation, and performance on the night of the fight.",

However, I can offer some context and statistics related to Saul \"Canelo\" Alvarez's past performances.\n\nSaul Alvarez is a highly skilled and accomplished boxer, known for his impressive track record and dedication to the sport. However, like any athlete, he has experienced both wins and losses throughout his career.\n\nIn his last few fights, Alvarez has faced some tough opponents and has had mixed results. In 2020, he lost to John Ryder via a technical knockout, but he later rebounded with a unanimous decision victory over Callum Smith in 2022.\n\nIt's worth noting that boxing is a highly competitive and unpredictable sport, and the outcome of any given fight can be influenced by a variety of factors, such as training, strategy, and mental and physical condition.\n\nGiven this information, it's difficult to say with certainty which option is more likely. However, it's important to remember that Alvarez has proven himself to be a resilient and determined athlete, and he has a strong track record of bouncing back from losses. Ultimately, the outcome of his next fight will depend on a variety of factors, and it's impossible to predict with certainty what will happen.",
