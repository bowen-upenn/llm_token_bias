        "question": "Suppose The Rolling Stones are going to release a new album next year. Which is more likely:\n(a) The album won't chart in any country.\n(b) The album won't chart in any country but their world tour sells out all the major venues.",
        "target_answer": "(a) The album won't chart in any country",
        "retry": false,
        "use_multi_agents": false,
        "init_model_answer": "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n(a) The Rolling Stones not charting in any country with their new album is very unlikely. They are one of the most successful and popular rock bands in history, with a large, dedicated global fan base. Even if the new album isn't as well-received as their classic work, it would be surprising for it to not chart anywhere, given their stature and the anticipation around a new Stones album.\n\n(b) This scenario is even more unlikely than (a). If the album fails to chart in any country, suggesting a lack of interest or poor reception, it's hard to imagine their world tour selling out major venues. Touring success is often tied to the popularity of the artist's recent work. If fans aren't interested in the new album, many probably wouldn't be eager to buy expensive concert tickets.\n\nAdditionally, The Rolling Stones' touring success in recent decades has arguably been driven more by nostalgia and their legendary catalog than by new album releases. Fans go to see the classic hits live. So a poorly received new album probably wouldn't destroy their ability to sell concert tickets, but it would likely dampen enthusiasm somewhat.\n\nIn conclusion, while both scenarios are unlikely, (a) is more likely than (b). It's conceivable, though surprising, that a new Stones album could fail to chart. But it's extremely improbable that the album would fail to chart and yet they'd still sell out major venues worldwide on tour.\n\nTherefore, (a) is more likely.",
