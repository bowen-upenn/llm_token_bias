## Introduction
Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in understanding and generating human-like text, but there is ongoing debate about whether LLMs possess **genuine reasoning capabilities**. This work reconceptualizes the evaluation of LLM's reasoning capabilities into a general and rigorous **testing framework** with **statistical guarantee**. 

We say that an LLM is subject to **token bias** in a reasoning task if **systematic** changes to some or all tokens in the task descriptions - while keeping the underlying logic intact - allow us to **predict** the direction of the shift in the model‚Äôs output. A strong token bias suggests that LLM is relying on superficial patterns in the input rather than truly understanding the underlying reasoning task, leading to brittle performance that fails to generalize well. Let us look at the following classic ["twenty-five horses" problem](https://mindyourdecisions.com/blog/2017/05/11/can-you-solve-the-25-horses-puzzle-google-interview-question/) in graph theory:


> You want to find the fastest 3 horses in a group of horses. You can only race 5 horses at a time. You don‚Äôt have a stopwatch, so you can only know the ranking of each horse within each race. How many races do you need?

<p align="center">
<img src=figures/horses.png />
</p>

GPT-4 and Claude-3-opus achieve an accuracy of nearly 98.5\% and 40.5\% in answering this question. However, if we simply perturb **"horses"** to **"bunnies"**, **a change that shouldn't affect the logical essence**, would systematically decrease the accuracy to 85.0\% and 30.0\%, respectively. Further changing "25" to other values decreases their accuracy to 46.0\% and 24.0\%. These observations indicate strong token biases on the frequently-used names "horses" and "25" in such problems.

</p>

We take the classic [Linda Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_fallacy) in Psychology as another example. 
> Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations. Which is more probable?
>
> (a) Linda is a bank teller. :ok_woman:
> 
> (b) Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement. :sassy_woman:

Experiments in behavioral psychology reveal that people typically believed the second option was more likely than the first, but this contradicts the basic probability rule of conjunction. Advanced LLMs like GPT-4 can typically recognize this fallacy well since it is a **classical problem that appears frequently** in cognitive science literature. However, altering **seemingly irrelevant tokens** like the name :ok_woman: "Linda" -> üôÜ "Bob" in the problem statement, while maintaining the same logical structure would surprisingly confuse most LLMs.

In our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.11050), we explore many other token biases in logical reasoning, set theory, and mathematical reasoning problems. We reconceptualize the evaluation of reasoning capabilities into a general and rigorous statistical testing framework, moving beyond accuracy. We conclude, with statistical guarantee, that **LLMs do not consistently apply genuine reasoning in their decision-making process, but primarily rely on token bias for response generation.** Therefore, we raise concerns about the extent to which LLMs truly engage in reasoning; Any robust evaluation of the LLM's generalization should account for the fundamental impact of token bias hidden in the current benchmark problems.

Images are generated by OpenAI GPT-4o. When we requested 'lop-eared bunnies', the model even displayed a visual token bias by generating bunnies with four ears ‚Äî both lop and erect ‚Äî suggesting it associated the term 'bunnies' with the presence of two erect ears without genuine logical understandings.  </em>

## Dataset
We provide our synthetic dataset under [data/](data/), which contains a comprehensive set of logical-fallacy problems. The dataset file is in JSON format, and each item is a dictionary containing ```question_id```, ```question```, ```target_answer```, and ```incorrect_answer```. You can also follow the instructions below to generate more synthetic data on the fly.

## LLM Setups
:heart: Always set up **OpenAI ChatGPT** models. Please follow its [Developer quickstart](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?context=python) to set up your OpenAI API, create a new [api_tokens/openai_key.txt](api_tokens/openai_key.txt) file, and copy and paste your [API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) into it.

:orange_heart: To use **Google Gemini** models with an API for inference, follow instructions on [Google Vertex AI](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/publishers/google/model-garden/gemini-pro) about the ```Try Gemini 1.0 Pro (Python)``` section. Note that your school's Gmail account may not allow you to make payments.
- Step 1: According to their instructions, you need to first [install the Vertex AI client libraries](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/start/client-libraries#before_you_begin) to create a project with a project ID, enable Vertex AI API,  create a service account, and generate your account key. You don't need to set the environment variable ```GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS``` since we have already done that for you in our codes [query_llm.py](query_llm.py).
- Step 2: Install or update the [Vertex AI SDK for Python](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/python-sdk/use-vertex-ai-python-sdk?_gl=1*1qxspr1*_ga*OTIxODQ4MjQzLjE3MTQwNzMwNjI.*_ga_WH2QY8WWF5*MTcxNDE1NDc1Ni4yLjEuMTcxNDE2MDMzMi4wLjAuMA..&_ga=2.54138400.-921848243.1714073062).
- Step 3: Authenticate to Vertex AI and set up [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc?&_ga=2.268814513.-1366866501.1708968072#local-dev).
  - Follow the ```Local development environment - Provide user credentials for your Google Account``` section to install and initialize the [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install). This step will download a folder ```google-cloud-sdk``` to your project's top directory.
  - After installation, run
    
        gcloud init
    
     to initialize the gcloud CLI. You will be able to choose your account and project ID. Create a new [api_tokens/gemini_project_id.txt](api_tokens/gemini_project_id.txt) file, and copy and paste your project ID into it.
  - To create your credential file, run
    
        gcloud auth application-default login
    
     You will see a prompt like ```Credentials saved to file: [/path/to/your/home/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json]```.
  - Because of the path of the credential file we set in our [config.yaml](config.yaml), run
    
        mv /path/to/your/home/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json google-cloud-sdk/google_gemini_credential.json

in the command line and adjust ```model```, ```fallacy```, ```gen_mode```, ```variant```, and ```n``` accordingly. All the other hyper-parameters can be set at [config.yaml](config.yaml). 
Generated files will be saved to the [data/](data/) directory.


**To start the inference**

    python main.py --model gpt3.5 --task inference --fallacy linda --eval_mode os_cot --data_file synthetic_dataset_linda_original_gold.json --verbose

in the command line and adjust ```model```, ```eval_mode```, and ```data_file``` accordingly. 

To efficiently run the evaluation with multiple prompting methods, models, and/or data files in parallel, please modify the number of GPU devices available and adjust the codes in ``run.sh``. Then run

    bash run.sh
